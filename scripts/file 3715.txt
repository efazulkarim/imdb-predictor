MAN 1: 
Come here. 
Yeah. 
Good boy. 
MAN 2: 
Evening, sir. 
[metal door sliding closed] 
[machinery rumbling] 
[animal panting] 
[crowd shouting] 
MAN 1: 
Watch me. 
Watch him. 
[crowd cheering and shouting] 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: 
Just do it! Kill him! 
MAN 1: 
We're the competition. 
PIT WORKER: 
Good evening, sir. 
[barking] 
[dog growling] 
Sit. 
[dogs barking] 
PIT BOSS: 
Release your dogs!

MAN: 
Eddie...huh? Hey. 
[car horn blares] 
[men shouting] 
[loud crash] 
Eddie. 
Yo. 
Eddie. 
I don't think 
he's listening. 
Eddie? 
Why don't I hold onto that 
for you. 
Whole precinct's out there. 
But they're looking 
for four guys in a Cadillac. 
We can split up the money, 
just go solo on foot. 
You got a 200-pound mag drill 
in your back pocket 
you been holding 
and not telling us about? 
The car is hidden from the 
street unless they get close, 
but we're sitting ducks 
down here if they do. 
[metal creaking] 
Municipal storage facility. 
Anyone with a car 
owe you a favor? 
Short notice, 
short money? 
Not in my Rolodex. 
GAGE: 
What the fuck's a Rolodex? 
Don't talk for a while, okay? 
Watch yourself. 
A lot further to fall. 
STACY: 
Car troubles. 
Yeah. 
Page 3/40
Wild card came up a deuce. 
Take us a day 
to crack it. 
I can make you whole then. 
Right. Right. 
What'd he say? 
He said we're 
all over the news. 
Told us we're on our own 
till nightfall at best, 
and that he'd need 
at least 50% hazard pay 
to think about 
sticking his neck out. 
He said, "Call back 
an hour before sundown." 
He'll know if he can send a van, if it's cooled off by then. 
Fucking sundown? 
What? 
You stupid 
piece of shit. 
No one told me 
there was alarms. 
Yeah, that wouldn't 
have mattered 
if you stuck 
with the fucking safe 
instead of making a detour 
to the pharmacy section 
on your own initiative. 
I saw an in, 
I took it. 
Look, I can-- I can flip dope. That's good loot. 
You fucked us! 
No. We should have 
had pieces. 
Pieces? This was a soft in, 
soft out. 
This is no guns needed. 
This is candy from a baby. 
You going 
to shoot a cop? 
Page 4/40
I don't know 
who I'm going to shoot. 
You watch that. 
Look, we got the safe 
and we got out. 
That's a fucking score. 
Oh, yeah. Why don't you 
tell that 
to our wheelman's wife? 
I'm sure she'll be 
very proud of us. 
Maybe you give her a couple 
hundred from your cut 
for the casket. 
Yeah, I-- I didn't need 
to bring you in. 
To your low-rent 
box store job? Huh? 
We'll be lucky if we pull 
30K from this shit-show. 
If you even give us a chance 
to fucking crack this safe. 
Thanks for the lead, ace. 
Fuck you. 
Fuck, you're stupider 
than your fucking cousin. 
Morons. 
What? 
What the fuck? 
He's sick. 
Christ. 
What the fuck 
would you know? 
Son, I've spilled more dope 
than you'll ever live to shoot. Look, I... 
I just didn't have my wake-up 
this morning, all right? 
So you figured you'd nab one 
while we were on the clock? 
Just let me get well. 
All right? 
Come on, man. 
It's... 
Page 5/40
WALKER: 
Your show. 
I should let you 
fucking sweat it. 
It's the small bottle. 
It's yellow powder. 
Yeah. 
[drops bag] 
They got a sink 
in here? 
WALKER: 
longer than you have? 
Yeah, whatever. 
Stay away from 
the street-side windows. 
And don't go 
the fuck outside. 
Ah, f... 
[panting] 
You said this was 
going to be easy. 
Come on. 
Almost there. 
[traffic ambience, 
cars passing distantly] 
STACY: 
Sometimes I pretend 
the sounds of cars passing by 
are waves on some little black sand beach, far away from here. 
GRACE: 
You don't have to pretend. 
[echoing]: 
Let's fly away. 
[helicopter flying overhead] 
I fucked up. 
Taking down rinky-dink scores 
with punks that can't keep their hands out of the cookie jar 
Page 6/40
long enough to finish 
the main course? 
I dropped the ball, Walker. 
I'm sorry. 
WALKER: 
I've seen this. 
Guys gets shaken up, you know, partner dies, 
their kid gets sick. 
Maybe their wife 
balls someone else, 
and they start making 
their own chaos. 
Walker... 
There are only three kinds 
of last score, Stacy. 
The kind where you serve life, the kind where 
you're served a bullet, 
and the kind-- 
The kind where you walk away. 
Man's got to know 
what he is. 
Yeah? 
What are you? 
You know, I did this score 
when my kid was little. 
Christmas Eve, 
I couldn't have been, what, 25? Pet shop job. 
I knew this guy, 
he was the manager. 
Says there's going 
to be 5 grand in the safe. 
I guess these places 
do good on holidays. 
You know, what with the kittens and bunnies, and all that. 
I'm counting on this score 
to put something under the tree for my little girl, so I go, 
you know, I crack this safe. 
It's a four-number, 
Page 7/40
mechanical combo. 
Eyes and ears only. 
I am so proud of myself. 
I pull this thing open... 
There's nothing. 
Not a note. 
Turns out this manager's 
a fucking degenerate 
like everybody else, 
and he's already dropped 
all the money it at the track. [door closes] 
Remember, my little girl 
has been listening 
for sleigh bells all week, 
so I go looking for 
a bunny or a cat to get her. 
But all they got left 
is puppies and fish. 
So I find this fish. 
Tropical one. 
Beautiful. 
Bright yellow. 
Different than the others. 
Perfect. 
I grab the whole tank. 
Must've weighed 60 pounds, 
cord hanging off the back. 
And I'm about to take off. 
And I stop and think, 
"Am I really about 
to walk out of a job 
with one goddamned fish?" 
So I go fishing. 
Long shrimp-looking ones, 
leopard-type guys, 
big old black ones 
with those big bubble eyes. 
Just dropping them in the tank with Yellow. 
I'm pretty happy 
how this worked out, you know? I never would've come up 
with this on my own. 
Page 8/40
It would've been a teddy bear, or a doll if I was 
really flush. 
But this, 
this is inspired. 
So I slip in, I set up this 
tank right under the tree, 
because I just got to see 
the look on my daughter's face when she sees this. 
But lugging that aquarium 
around is hard work. 
I'm out as soon 
as I hit the chair. 
Then I wake up, 
and there's this screaming. 
Nothing like that sound. 
Sound of your own kid, 
just screaming. 
[girl screams] 
All these fish are dead. 
All bloated up 
like some East River dump job. All except 
that yellow tropical. 
Turns out that freshwater fish don't make it in the salt. 
Me, I'm a freshwater fish. 
I know I'm in 
the right tank. 
Maybe we should go check on 
that kid before he, you know, 
takes a selfie 
up on the roof. 
Posts it to Instagram. 
Fuck you. 
Testost-- Fuck. 
[heavy breathing and snarling] [footsteps] 
[dog whining] 
[chains rattle] 
[doors creak] 
[door closes] 
Shame. 
Page 9/40
He's finished. 
I'll handle it. 
We'll be back 
for the count. 
[dog whines] 
Come on. 
[chains rattle] 
[thunder crashes] 
Up. 
Stay. 
[footsteps] 
[water lapping] 
[metallic click] 
[electricity powering up] 
[electricity crackles] 
[man screams] 
[dog snarls] 
Fuck! 
[striking blows] 
[striking blows continuous] 
[man grunts] 
[metallic object clatters] 
[sighs] 
[low growling] 
WALKER: 
Walk away. 
Nice and slow. 
[grunting and snorting] 
[barks] 
Shit. Run! 
WALKER: 
Jesus! Fuck! Shit. 
GAGE: 
Holy fuck. 
STACY: 
WALKER: 
GAGE: 
It's coming! 
Page 10/40
WALKER: 
Shut the fucking door. 
[panting] 
What the fuck was that? 
Beware of still water 
or a silent dog. 
You know, I bunked 
with this gangbanger. 
He used to fight pits 
in Chicago. 
So, this guy, he tells me, 
the big organizations, 
they hop from place to place, 
and that someone 
sticks around 
to put the losers down 
when the show is over. 
There's a fire escape. 
GAGE: 
the fuck out of here. 
Go back for the money. 
Ride knows 
where we're at. 
WALKER: 
here when he comes, 
otherwise he takes 
the safe, 
he tells us it's 
in an evidence room downtown, 
we don't see a fucking dime. 
All right, we hole up here 
till the van comes. 
Bust out the window 
and take the stairs. 
Get the safe. 
Oh, fuck. 
STACY: 
GAGE: 
What the hell 
Page 11/40
do you think you're doing? 
I'm fucking sick. 
And? 
And my dope's in the other room. Did you...? 
Did we not almost get eaten 
by a giant fucking dog? 
[coughs and retches] 
Jesus, man. 
Fuck you. 
WALKER: 
Calm down. What the fuck's 
the matter with you? 
[grunts] 
You broke my fucking nose. 
I should've thrown you out 
of the fucking car, 
is what I should have done. 
Jesus Christ. 
See, now I feel bad. 
And he was going for you. 
Jesus. 
Just try and get in between 
a junkie and his stuff. 
Fucking hell. 
Walker. 
[tinkling] 
[loud crash] 
Jesus. 
HANDLER: 
Said you had him six months now? 
BLUE: 
Mm-hmm. 
Been letting my little niece 
play with him. 
HANDLER: 
You making a pet? 
BLUE: 
Could do it. 
Page 12/40
Big paws. 
Mm-hmm. 
Raise him right, 
could be a wrecker. 
If he's game. 
You going 
to roll him? 
Only way to know. 
I'll start the work. 
[whimpers] 
WALKER: 
You think I'm helping you carry that kid down that fire escape, you're out of your fucking mind. 
STACY: 
I can fucking carry him. 
WALKER: 
Bet you wish we had pieces now. 
STACY: 
Listen, man, I've done 
plenty of dirt, 
but I ain't shooting 
no fucking dog. 
[Walker laughs] 
This shit's funny to you? 
Well, it's just that I've always known you to be a cat person. 
Fuck you. 
Back at you. 
I'm not. 
Not, what? 
I'm not a cat person. 
You just switched? 
I like cats. 
I still like them. 
I just-- I got a preference 
for dogs now, that's all. 
It's all right 
to be a cat person. 
I know it is. 
Page 13/40
I mean, they're smart, 
they're independent, 
you don't have to pick up 
their shit. 
I just-- You know, I had a thing happen on a job that, 
you know, made me re-think 
the thing. That's all. 
You had another dog thing 
happen on a job? 
Long story. 
Yeah, well, it's not like 
we have a paucity of time. 
It's personal. 
What kind of job? 
I told you, 
it's personal. 
Listen, you know, 
being a cat person 
doesn't necessarily 
make you less of a man. 
Will you stop? 
You had to be there. 
I mean, it doesn't make you, 
like, a giant pussy. 
Truffles. 
It was a truffles job. 
Truffles...truffles, 
like chocolates? 
No, like mushrooms. 
The fuck-- You did 
a mushroom job? 
Not mushrooms. 
Truffles. 
[laughs]: 
What the fuck? 
Are you fucking 
kidding me? 
I'm serious. 
I mean, figured dope boys get, what, 18K for a key of blow? 
A kilo of White Alba's will 
get you a hundred fucking K. 
Page 14/40
Fuck. 
How did you get 
plugged in with that? 
I knew this crazy kid 
from East Boston. 
Used to work in the kitchen 
with me in the joint. 
Pretty good chef when he wasn't robbing armored cars. 
I finished my stint, 
I get out, 
this guy is in Gourmet 
fucking magazine. 
Ah, and he needed truffles. 
Yeah. Fifty cents 
on the dollar. 
But where the fuck 
is the product? 
It's in the ground. 
You got to dig it up. 
Except he tells me 
about this auction 
that they hold 
once a year, right? 
The fucking thing 
is simulcast, 
Florence, London, Macau. 
Sold. 
STACY: 
Now, these things get brought 
in the country chained 
to some ex-Mossad's wrist. 
High security. 
But the guy that runs 
the auction decides 
he's going to cut costs. 
Puts them in a regular old 
storage unit 
right here in town. 
I case the place. 
There's only one guard 
on night shift. 
Poor bastard humps mail 
Page 15/40
all day for the post office, 
so he's out like a light 
soon as the guy before him 
takes off. 
But I can't for the life of me figure out 
what unit these truffles 
are in. 
I get this methed-out 
Bulgarian hacker, 
dresses like Obi-Wan Kenobi, 
to try and check 
client records for me. 
No dice, man. 
Place is old-school. 
Strictly paper files. 
I pull a favor with Mr. Clean 
and borrow a truck. 
I start digging 
through this place's trash 
for billing statements, 
invoices, credit card receipts, anything I can find 
to track these things down. 
But this place shares an alley with a Korean fish market, 
and the only thing I'm going 
to get out of these Dumpsters 
is fucking cholera. 
I tell the chef 
I'm throwing in the towel. 
I mean, this place 
is 12 floors, 50 units each. 
But he begs me to stay on. 
Tells me he's going to pay me 
70 cents on the dollar. 
So I do a little research, 
find out about this guy 
in New Jersey. 
Crazy South African 
living in a shack 
way out in the Pine Barrens. 
Got that disease where he's got no hair on his body. 
Page 16/40
He trains truffle dogs. 
WALKER: 
Truffle dogs? 
Yeah, well, they're better 
than pigs 
because pigs eat 
the things. 
Dogs will just dig them up, 
as long as you've got food 
they like better on standby. 
Makes sense. 
STACY: 
Turns out there's 
only a handful 
of real deal ace truffle dogs 
in the whole fucking country, 
and this guy owns two. 
Now, as you know, at the time, I haven't yet cultivated 
an appreciation 
for the canine species, 
but I'm looking at this little Jack Russell and I'm thinking, maybe I can make this work. 
Get one of those 
carrying cases, 
like what's-her-name 
with the sex video? 
Sneak him right into the place and sniff the shit out. 
[barks] 
Whoa. 
This little bastard must smell my cat or something, 
because he won't even 
let me get near him. 
That ain't going 
to work. 
So I have to take 
the other one. 
WALKER: 
Page 17/40
there's another one? 
STACY: 
I already told you. 
This guy's got 
two of these things. 
Keeps the second one 
in a big-ass cage 
he's got built out back, 
because he says 
it ain't housebroken yet. 
WALKER: 
a big-ass cage 
for a Jack Russell? 
STACY: 
No, man. 
WALKER: 
a hound or something? 
STACY: 
Mm-mm. 
Goddamn standard poodle. 
Haircut and everything. 
We cover nine floors, 
and old boy 
is doing his thing, 
but he's not getting 
any hits. 
At this point I'm getting 
nervous, you know, 
because the morning crew 
is going to relieve 
Sleeping Beauty 
in half an hour, 
and Pom-Poms 
ain't seeing shit. 
And just when I'm starting 
to think I got conned... 
it's all there. 
The goddamn 
truffle mother lode. 
Page 18/40
Come on. 
So I give Pom-Poms 
his reward, 
I start loading these things 
out into the hall. 
And there's Sleeping Beauty. 
I don't know what must've 
happened to this guy 
at the post office that day, 
but the way 
he's looking at me, 
I can just tell he's getting 
ready to put me down. 
I mean, I can do a stretch 
just fine, 
but the prospect 
of getting killed 
over a bunch of mushrooms? 
Truffles. 
Whatever. 
It's not sitting right. 
So I start praying to God. 
And the damndest thing happens. I mean, if I'd have pulled 
two .45s, 
this guy wouldn't 
have thought twice 
about peeling my scalp back 
right then and there. 
But this mailman... 
he sees a dog 
and he's in the wind. 
[laughs] 
Come on. That's bullshit. 
On my life, man. 
Took old boy 
straight to the groomers, 
dropped $200 
getting his pom-pom fluffed. 
Been a dog lover 
ever since. 
What the shit? 
WALKER: 
Page 19/40
Fucking kid. 
[flies buzzing] 
[sighs] 
[indistinct voices] 
STACY: 
Kid! 
Kid! 
Nothing. 
What is it? 
OFFICER: 
Dispatch, this is K-309. 
Checking out the municipal 
storage facility, 
Conrad and Gardener. 
DISPATCHER: 
Copy unit K9. 
Oh, fuck. 
OFFICER: 
Got a jimmied door here. 
Possible signs 
of forced entry. 
Going to let Charlie 
have a sniff around. 
DISPATCHER: 
Copy that. 
I need an additional unit 
at Conrad and Berger. 
OFFICER [over radio]: 
Dispatch, this is car 210 
responding. 
I'm about eight blocks 
from Connie, on Lerner. 
I'll head over now. 
DISPATCHER: 
K-309, 
car 210 is en route 
to you now. 
They fucked us. 
Page 20/40
The kid fucked us. 
DISPATCHER: 
Be advised, we are looking 
for a late '80s 
gold-colored Cadillac. 
Castillo suspects are armed. 
[huffing and panting] 
[growls] 
210 is checking 
the perimeter now. 
Other units, 
please stand by. 
OFFICER: 
Dispatch, we've got possible 
activity in here. 
Charlie's all fired up 
over something. 
[growling] 
[barks] 
Easy. Easy, easy, boy. 
Easy, easy. 
Good boy, Charlie. 
Good boy. It's okay. 
Who's a good boy? 
You're a good boy. 
You're good. 
[laughs]: 
Hey, good boy. 
Good boy, Charlie. 
Good boy. 
Who's a little boy? 
Good boy, Charlie. 
You're a good boy, 
Charlie. 
DISPATCHER: 
210, we're all clear in there. Just Charlie 
chasing his tail again. 
Copy that. 
[loud bang] 
Page 21/40
GAGE: 
Let me in. 
[knocking on door] 
[knocking persists] 
STACY: 
What about the dog? 
It's out here playing Frisbee 
with me. 
The thing was half dead 
to begin with. 
Let me the fuck in. 
[objects crash] 
Are you rearranging 
the fucking furniture? 
Look, there's a van downstairs in a loading dock. 
I bet you my whole share 
the key's sitting right there 
in the dead guy's 
fucking pocket. 
Okay, let me the fuck in. 
You pull that shit again, 
you're going to stay out there. Yeah, whatever. 
[dog barks] 
[growling] 
WALKER: 
Shit. Fuck. Shit. 
[groans] 
Fuck! 
Hey! 
[grunts] 
Oh, fuck. 
[barking] 
Oh, shit. 
[growling] 
Run, man. Go. 
[panting] 
Run! 
Fuck. Shit. 
[barking] 
Page 22/40
Kid? You hear me? 
Look at me. You okay? 
WALKER: 
Broke a rib. I'll live. 
Help me with the fucking kid. 
STACY: 
Ah, Christ. Fucking shit. 
WALKER: 
Hang in there. 
We're going to find something 
to make you a tourniquet. 
Okay? 
[barks and growls] 
Staunch the flow 
and clean it up. 
[panting] 
Fuck! 
WALKER: 
Come on! 
Come on. Jesus. 
Shit. 
[distant indistinct chatter] 
[dog whines] 
MAN 1: 
Get the fuck out of here! 
MAN 2: 
I got-- I got a bag of marbles around here... 
[indistinct chatter] 
[dogs barking] 
[whines] 
That's your prospect? 
Uh-huh. 
MAN: 
I've been working him. 
MAN: 
Page 23/40
Shit. What line he from? 
HANDLER: 
Scatter-bred. 
MAN: 
All respect due, 
I don't think you want a tot 
going 40 pounds uphill 
on the Russian. 
Do I look like 
a yard boy to you? 
Take the fucking dog 
and put it in the corner. 
Come on, boy. 
[dog panting] 
[growling] 
[growls and barks] 
[panting] 
[barking] 
You could call it 
if it's ugly. 
You can't. 
[dog whining] 
Shh. 
[barking] 
Release your dog. 
[dogs growling and barking] 
[bodies crashing, 
flesh tearing] 
[growling, flesh tearing] 
[dog whimpers] 
[body thuds] 
Yeah. 
No main cables. 
Walker knows 
a good doctor. 
He came up doing cuts 
for Chuck Wepner, 
so he's seen a lot worse. 
He'll get you squared away, 
as soon as we get the fuck 
out of here. 
Sorry about... 
Page 24/40
Yeah, well... 
sorry about your face. 
Fucking Weeble Wobble, man. 
What the fuck's 
a Weeble Wobble? 
It's a toy. 
Fucking Weeble Wobble, 
you know? 
Weeble Wobble? 
Don't fall down? 
Like-- Like a-- 
Like a Slinky. 
Forget it. 
Tournament brackets. 
WALKER: 
Looks like it. 
Fucking hell. 
What are these? Purses? 
WALKER: 
Note 25, 50, 100, two. 
This is chump change. 
Look at this guy. 
Was he fighting pairs? 
Tough motherfucker. 
Jesus. 
Nobody wins. 
WALKER: 
Jesus fuck, this was last night. Christ, how long 
until sundown? 
STACY: 
Call our ride in 50, 
then get out that fire escape. Yeah, well, 
what say you, kid? 
Hmm? 
Are you a cat person, 
or are you more of a dog person? Dogs. 
I used to love them books 
Page 25/40
when I was little 
where they got them 
acting like people. 
You know, driving around 
in cars, 
and making deposits 
at the bank, 
and buying ice cream cones 
and all that. 
Dad kept on having to whup my 
ass for trying to talk to them. To dogs? 
Yeah. I'd see them 
tied up outside the store, 
and I'd ask where they parked 
their trucks. 
[chuckles] 
I always wanted one, 
but Pops said he could hardly 
keep us fed. 
So I had chickens 
and stuff. 
You a farm boy? 
No, just-- Just country. 
A few egg hens, 
a busted-ass old milk cow. 
I found this one dog by the side of the road when I was 6. 
It couldn't have been 
more than a couple years old. 
He-- He must've got hit 
by a car or something. 
His leg was busted up 
real bad. 
He was a-- He was a shepherd, 
I think. 
[whimpers] 
I knew my pop wouldn't 
let me keep him. 
The dog catcher 
would just put him down. 
So I hauled his poor ass all 
the way back to this old shack we had out 
Page 26/40
behind our house. 
And Dad was drinking 
so much by then 
I knew the toolshed's 
the last place he'd be. 
But this little dog was crying so loud from the pain 
that first day, 
I was sure he'd hear 
no matter how loaded he was. 
I stayed in there 
all night, 
petting him and begging him 
to be quiet 
till he finally 
calmed down. 
Started bringing my lunches 
home from school. 
At first all he wanted 
was that cheese you peel off. 
But a few days in I had him 
grubbing on meatballs, 
and smiley face tater tots, 
and chicken nuggets, 
and all that, 
like a regular schoolboy. 
Had to clean the shit 
off his fur every day, 
because his leg was still 
too fucked to stand up. 
But I didn't mind. 
Nobody'd ever been that happy 
to see me my whole life 
as when I walked 
in that room. 
Tail wagging so hard 
against the ground 
he's kicking up dust 
all over himself. 
[door chime dings] 
I'd hide food under my bed 
to save up for the weekends, 
you know, 
but it was June already. 
Page 27/40
Pretty soon school was done. 
I busted open my piggy bank, 
sold some baseball cards 
I had from Christmas 
and bought him some food, 
but I ran out after a week. 
Had to swear I wouldn't come 
back to the only store in town after I got caught 
racking Alpo 
to convince them 
not to tell my pop. 
Only one place 
left to go for food. 
I was having nightmares 
just thinking about it. 
But the look on that dog's face after a couple days, 
it was like not eating 
wasn't the worst of it for him. Like he thought 
he was in trouble, you know? 
Like he thought I was punishing him for something, 
and he couldn't figure out 
what it was he did wrong. 
Started to get this froth 
around his lips. 
Tail slowing down. 
Two more days, and it wasn't 
hardly moving at all. 
It got so I couldn't 
stand it anymore. 
Waited till late at night. 
Never been so scared 
in my whole life. 
Took a big old block of hamburg from the fridge. 
Buried the wrapper 
with the chickens. 
I can still see that dog's face when he saw me come in with it. Swear to God he's grinning at me just like a little kid. 
Page 28/40
Tears running down his nose, 
because he's crying 
he's so happy. 
Next morning I came back in 
from my chores. 
Chickens. 
They must have dug it up. 
I was praying 
while I ran. 
Like if I prayed hard enough, 
everything was going 
to be okay. 
My dad... 
he was waiting for me. 
Worst part of it was, 
dog's got that same look 
he always did 
when he saw me come in. 
Like he's smiling at me. 
Tail just wagging away 
in the dust. 
[dog yelps] 
I was stupid. 
[clears throat and sniffles] 
Stupid kid. 
I'm really tired. 
[sobs softly] 
STACY: 
Yeah, well, what am I 
supposed to do, 
drag that fucking safe 
out of here on foot? 
All right. Whatever. 
Yeah. Yeah. 
Thanks for fucking nothing. 
Still too much heat. 
Said maybe tomorrow. 
Miss January. 
Hmm. 
Stole her out of my neighbor's mailbox last week. 
[hinges creak] 
Those purses 
Page 29/40
in the other room. 
I know, missing 
a couple zeroes. 
STACY: 
Somebody's coming back for this. It's a lot more 
than we got in that safe. 
Not too much 
to carry out. 
I'll pack. 
I'll get the kid. 
[clears throat] 
Fuck. 
Might be your lucky day... 
Kid. 
Stupid kid. 
History's a rock. 
Can't swim 
if you're holding it. 
Whenever you're ready. 
I'm going to meet you 
out there. 
Couple more jobs, 
then I'm on a plane. 
I won't wait. 
Not even for you. 
[door opens] 
STACY: 
I'll see you by the sea. 
[door closes] 
[Walker grunting] 
Hey. Hey. 
It's okay. 
I'm all right. 
I'm all right. 
[groans] 
Show me. 
I'm all right. It's-- 
Fucking show me, Walker. 
Fuck. I'm okay. 
Here, look. 
You fucking 
Page 30/40
kidding me, man? 
What? 
I seen a guy in the joint 
take a boot party 
from the screws, 
he looked just like that. 
Went to sleep, 
he never woke up. 
Fuck that. I just need 
to sit for a minute, man. 
What the fuck are you doing? 
I'm calling an ambulance. 
Hey. 
What the fuck, man? 
Solo, you get 
out of here easy. 
Just go. 
Van. 
Downstairs. 
You heard the kid. 
I'll go down there, 
take the key off the dead guy, I'll come back, 
I'll scoop you. 
Walk through that door, 
that fucking dog's 
going to eat you alive. 
What am I going to do, 
sit here and watch you bleed out into your own gut? 
No. I want you to go down 
the fucking fire escape, 
and walk away. 
Listen, man, 
people don't recover 
from what you got 
without a fucking doctor. 
Get yourself a ticket. 
Shut up. 
Get on a fucking plane... 
Shut the fuck up. 
...and fly to the fucking beach. What makes you think 
I didn't try? 
Page 31/40
Man, when I walk 
past a place, 
I clock the traffic 
three blocks around. 
How far to the street, 
how long to the nearest 
precinct. 
Whether the roof's 
softer than the walls, 
or if can cut in 
through the joint next door. 
I see if the floors 
can support a strongbox, 
whether I should 
load in a drill, 
or if there's a pick-point 
strong enough 
so I can drop the unit 
into a car downstairs. 
Been the same way 
since I was 
popping spoilers 
off of Supras, 
doing housebreaks 
through doggy doors. 
I packed my fucking bags, man. I even bought 
one of those stupid things 
you put on your nose 
to keep the sun off. 
But all I could think about 
when it was time to go was... 
how long before I blew it 
all to hell. 
So I went ahead 
and pulled the pin. 
Because why the fuck should 
I postpone the inevitable? 
She's gone, Walker. 
Five years fucking gone. 
And she said 
she wouldn't wait. 
All the books you read, 
the great romances, 
Page 32/40
like runaway trains 
that roll over anything 
that gets in the way. 
Didn't you ever think they might not just be a fantasy? 
You know, that you might 
be getting in the way 
of something 
that was meant to be, 
and you're just scared 
so stupid 
you're laying on the tracks 
instead of getting onboard? 
You know, 
but every once in a while 
even a degenerate gambler 
can tell a guy 
when it's time to cash out. 
She said... 
said she was going to get 
a puppy when it came time 
Told me I could pick it out 
if I was ready to join her. 
You said you couldn't leave, 
she said she wouldn't wait. 
But the way you two of you 
looked at each other... 
I think you might both 
be liars. 
We're getting the fuck 
out of here. 
Both of us. 
If you say so. 
It's your show. 
[chain rattling] 
[dog panting] 
Up. 
Sit. 
[door closes] 
Oh, fuck. 
Oh, Christ. 
Jesus. 
Jesus. 
[growls] 
Page 33/40
Easy. 
Easy, boy. 
Easy. 
Easy. 
[growling] 
Easy. 
[barks] 
Shit. 
[loud crash] 
Fuck. 
[breathing heavily] 
You got to be 
fucking kidding me. 
[distant bark] 
Oh, shit. 
[sniffing] 
[growls] 
[barks] 
[glass shatters] 
Aah! 
[barking] 
[panting] 
[footsteps] 
[dog sniffing] 
[sniffing continuous] 
[footsteps galloping] 
[loud crash] 
[growling] 
[loud crash] 
Fuck. 
[growling] 
[groans softly] 
[growling] 
[dog whines] 
[whimpering] 
[dog whining continuous] 
Fuck. 
Easy, now. Easy, boy. 
Easy. Good. 
[loud crash] 
We cool? 
Walk? 
Guess you really are 
a dog person. 
Page 34/40
[laughs] 
Let's get you up. 
Come on. 
Here, sit down. 
Sit down. 
Sit down, all right? 
[groans] 
Day we're having, 
that'll be the wrong key. 
[keys rattle] 
STACY: 
Come on, goddamn it. 
All right. What's behind 
door number two? 
[door rumbles open] 
Cops? 
Bird's gone. 
You sure you don't want 
to stick around? 
Yeah. 
Right, let's do it. 
[grunts] 
Oh, boy. 
You know, I'm thinking 
maybe I'll retire. 
Guy once told me there are only three types of last score. 
I've been wrong. 
Okay. 
Come on. 
That ain't our ride. 
Walker! 
Walker. 
Go! 
Walker. 
Fuck. Come on. 
Come on. 
Walker. Walker. 
Fuck. 
[gunshots] 
Fuck! 
[machine-gun fire] 
[Stacy gasps] 
Page 35/40
Oh, fuck. 
[inhales and exhales] 
My mother had a garden. 
It wasn't much more 
than a sandbox, really. 
But it was hers. 
Bluebells growing there. 
Beautiful. 
Our neighbor had a dog. 
Spanish mastiff. 
Big bastard. 
Did whatever the hell 
he pleased. 
Kept on coming into the yard 
and digging up those bluebells. [sighs] 
My mom would cry each time. 
She'd go out, 
try to fix the mess, 
put it all back together, 
start fresh. 
But that dog would go 
and do it all over. 
I went to talk 
to the owner. 
I asked him please to keep 
his pet out of our yard. 
He was a big guy, 
even bigger than the dog. 
And I was just a boy. 
Well, this mastiff... 
[laughs] 
...he went and did it again. 
And again, and again, 
and again, and again. 
[grunts] 
So you know what I did? 
I shot him. 
The neighbor, I mean. 
You see, 
a beast cannot 
be expected 
to understand 
private property. 
Page 36/40

But a man, 
even a stupid one, 
knows the difference 
between mine... 
and yours. 
Like that bag 
you got under there. 
And what I'm guessing 
you got inside it. 
Motherfucker. 
[panting] 
[screams] 
Shit. 
[panting] 
Whoa! 
[gunshots] 
[gasps] 
[groans] 
[gunshot] 
[groans] 
[light bulb buzzes] 
That mastiff 
I was talking about... 
I took him in. 
Dogs been a hobby of mine 
ever since. 
I find them fascinating. 
As many ways 
as we are different, 
just as many 
we are the same. 
But here's this thing 
I noticed. 
An old dog been doing 
something a while, 
it becomes 
almost automatic. 
Like when you are making 
the same drive home every day 
for 20 years, 
and the car just drives you. 
Let me put it simply. 
You know how it goes 
teaching an old dog new tricks. Page 37/40

What they don't tell you 
is why it never sticks. 
You see, an animal been acting a certain way for a while, 
it gets to be 
all he knows. 
And even if that behavior 
isn't working, 
even if they are eating 
pieces of the carpet, 
or chewing up your shoes 
and shitting out the laces 
until their guts are so tied up in knots they are half dead, 
you reach a certain point... 
Well, it ain't 
unheard of for a bitch 
to stop eating shoes, 
but I ain't never seen it, 
myself. 
It's not that 
complicated. 
A dog that fights 
is a fighting dog. 
A man that steals is thief. 
You want him to stop... 
there's only 
one thing to do. 
[footsteps] 
[whimpering] 
[whines] 
Well, look at you. 
[whimpering] 
Come here, boy. 
[sniffing] 
Come here. 
Yeah. 
Good boy. 
Good boy. 
Look at you. 
Come here, boy. 
Come here. 
That's it. 
That's it. That's it. 
Page 38/40
[panting] 
Fuck you. 
[growls] 
[screaming] 
[gunshot] 
No! 
[gasping and panting] 
Don't! 
[gunshot] 
[growling] 
It's okay. 
It's okay, now. 
It's okay. 
[whines] 
You're a good boy. 
You're a good boy. 
Good boy. 
You're a good boy.

["Every Day Will Be Like a 
Holiday" by William Bell plays] Every day 
Will be like a holiday 
When my baby 
When my baby comes home 
Now she's been gone 
For such a long time 
Ever since she's been gone 
She's been on my mind 
I got a letter today 
Just about noon 
She said, "Don't worry 
I'll be home soon" 
And every day 
Will be like a holiday 
Oh, I know it will 
When my baby 
When my baby comes home 
I'll never 
Have to worry 
About sitting 
By the phone 
When she gets here 
Page 39/40
I'll never be alone 
She said she'd get here 
Sometime today 
I know when she gets here 
She'll never go away 
And every day 
Oh, yeah 
Will be like a holiday 
Oh, yes, it will 
When my baby 
When my baby comes home 
Oh, every day 
Will be like a holiday 
Oh, yes, it will 
When my baby...
