-MR. Lamptey died

You were right. Sister and I
we were raised in the church.
We have learned the
ways of the Bible. They
had we have God in our
hearts, we were happy.
We were loved. God protected us.
But not the man who it was
supposed to protect us.
My dad has been having fun for months
with her sister's best friend.
She always lied. Mom found out.
She gathered her
courage to face him.
But it's cowardly packed
the jackets and went.
He left us and left with shame.
The locals stopped talking to us.
They stopped looking at us
eyes like we are invisible.
What does this have to do with my wife?
- Sake Sunday we would sit there,
we would listen to churches the
bells they call people on the mass,
and we were holding for hands.
We lost everything.
We did nothing wrong.
We were good people and we were
punished for the father's sins.
And my sister, my dear sister...
I found her in the stables,
hung on beams.
I have dedicated my life her.
To serve people.
Patients in the hospital
they talked to me,
They trust me, they
told me my secrets.
Things they did.
Bad things.
Did you know that John was
Lamptey had two women?
Do you remember Jane Spencer?
She dropped from the second
floor after calling the police
and said that her husband was joking. It
is was a lie. She did not even touch it.
He was arrested and charged
for an assassination attempt.
It all confessed to me after I did he
caught hitting the seams on his face
that her wounds look up.
Wanted to take it for divorce.
That man loved her.
- My wife liked me.
Your wife...
Your wife did not
wear a wedding ring
because she spread her
legs to another man.
You're lying.
- She was at all four as a fucking bitch.
Do not talk anymore. -Come on.
She was perfectly dressed,
drunk at the hotel bar.
He did not have any documents
to yourself when it crashed.
You really believe it was
in a working meeting?
I saw that guy. stealth she was
visiting her at the hospital.
Feathery, tall guy. Convenient.
-Shut up.
He told me they were doing it constantly.
That I can not help.
The Bible says we need it
be honest in marriage.
Your wife was a sinner.
Your wife was a whore.
You did not even cry.
- She was a sinner.
Tell me, who is wrong?
You, Natalie?
Or your wife?
I did it.
I want you to say that.
I killed her.
And now you know the reason.
Stop. You are an idiot.
What is it? What do you want me to do?
I tell? My name is Alan.
You're an idiot.
What is it? What do
you want me to say?
Do you enjoy that, sir?
I came here first with a woman.
Is your arm good?
That. I did not even notice it.
I was doing some housework.
Where's your house? -Over
it bridge, 5 km away.
Do you have a driver's seat, sir?
- Does the problem? - Please, please.
Of course.
All right, Officer? Investigating a car.
Your car corresponds to the description.
Your car is very small clean, Mr.
Lewis. -Is it?
I see.
All is well.
Can I look in the trunk?
Of course.
That's yours? -enino.
We apologize for the interference, sir.
-No problem.
What should I say to my
daughter when she is
with me? wonder what
happened to her mom?
You did not have the
right to take away my
wife before but I had a
chance to talk to her.
You have to give
it to the police.
I think that will be a problem.
Why did you have to
ruin everything?
My name is Cathy!
You think I'm going to
give up my life because
of you? I'm Cathy now
and I'm so happy.
You expect me to give up everything?
Because of you?
Where's the gun?!
Not!
Dad. -MR. Lewis. -Not!
Alondra.
Do not move!
Please do not hurt her.
- Get away, fuck!
Dad! -Summer!
Be very calm, Summer. Do
exactly what the lady says.
Why did you so complicate things?
It was all that easy.
And now this? -Please, he
did not hide anything.
It is not. You did not either.
Neither did I. Natalie, listen to me.
-My name is...
My name is Cathy.
She's a kid! -For everything
this is your fault here!
Dad.
Please. I'm begging you.
Do not hurt my baby.
Your kid.
You think this is your kid?
You were released, Roberta.
Cathy, listen to me.
You do not have to give it to the police.
I will not tell anyone.
I do not believe you. -You
can to return to old life.
I can not. I called the
police, they would locate
cell phone. He'll be here.
I'll tell them something.
This can only end in one way. I
am very sorry. -Only one thing.
This house shoots everything.
I pray? -You will hear
all you've just said.
You're lying.
Summer, get away!
Not.
Summer!
Summer!
Honey.
Summer. Honey.
Oh God.
Let's get outta here.
There you are.
Come. - Dad, there is not.
Come!
Come on in.
Close the door. Be here.
Fuck!
Honey. Come.
I'm sorry, Summer. I'm sorry.
I love you.
You are my child.
My child.
