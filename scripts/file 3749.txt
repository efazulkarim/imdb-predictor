Is he in his room? 
He's sleeping. 
Let's not make any sound. 
Oh! 
I thought we weren't 
making any sound. 
Where are you? 
- I'm right here. 
- Oh, there you are. 
Mmm. 
He wouldn't listen to my 
free throw shooting advice. 
You're the blind father 
giving basketball advice now? 
Yes. Yes, I am. 
Really? 
I used to be quite 
the all-star player, you know? - Mm-hmm. 
- I was! 
How's my favorite 
blind man doing? 
Still very much in the dark. 
Now we're even. 
Will you do 
the silly dance for me? 
No. 
Please. 
- No. 
- Come on, please. 
- No way. 
- Come on. 
You're really 
gonna make me do it? 
Mm-hmm. 
I'm not buying up. 
Yeah. 
Oh, fine. 
I bet you look 
so good right now. 
Oh, Bob told me a story today. Honey, I have 
to get up early tomorrow. 
Page 2/36
Fine. Okay. I won't tell you. 
It's a good story, though. 
Okay, fine. Let's hear it. 
Hmm. All right, so... 
There's this man... 
And he really wants 
to win the lottery. 
So, he prays to god. 
Every night for 50 years. 
Night, after night, 
after night, he prays. 
"Please god, please, 
let me win the lottery." 
Mm-hmm. 
And finally, 
an angel goes to god, 
and he says, 
"god, why don't we let 
this guy win?" 
And you know what god says? 
What? 
God says, 
"i want to..." 
"But he's never bought 
a lottery ticket." 
- Oh. 
- You see? 
- It was a good story. 
- Yeah, it's all right. 
What's wrong? 
Nothing. 
Dear god, I'm thankful 
for everything I have. 
I am deeply satisfied with 
my life and everything in it. 
And I live for today, 
and I enjoy what I do. 
I do not compare myself 
to others. 
Dad? 
Yeah, son. 
Is everything okay? 
Yeah. Yeah, of course it is. 
I was just getting some air. 
Page 3/36
Here, let's go back inside. 
You have school tomorrow. 
Come on. 
Oh, my god. 
Honey? 
What's wrong? 
- I... I can see you. 
- Huh? 
I can see you. 
How did this happen? 
How? 
How? 
How did this happen? 
How did this happen? 
I don't... I don't... 
How can a pituitary tumor 
just disappear overnight? 
It didn't disappear, it shrank. It is rare, but not unheard of. But the good news is 
it's normally pushing up 
against the optic chiasm. 
Which is how he can see? 
Mm-hmm. 
We'll only keep him here 
for a few days. 
We just wanna make sure 
there isn't cause for concern. So, you need to admit him? 
Just for a few days. 
Welcome home! 
They're brushing Joan out. 
Oh, and I called your work, 
talked to Bob. 
He's gonna talk to them. 
And hr told you to take 
as much time as you need. 
And they're fine with you not 
coming in 
until you feel up for it. 
So, um... 
Here, let me get that. 
I can do that. 
Oh, I know. 
Page 4/36
I'm just gonna call work 
and tell them 
that I'm not feeling well. 
Stay home. 
I need to do 
something with my hair. 
Now that you can see me. 
I have no idea what to do now. I'll go make us some lunch. 
Okay? 
I'll... I'll be fine. 
You know? 
- I'll be fine. 
- Yeah, I know. 
Here I am. 
This is crazy. 
I know. 
Took me 30 minutes 
to find that place. 
Does it hurt? 
No. Nah. 
No, not at all. 
What did the doctor say? 
He... 
Couldn't explain it. 
So, it's a miracle? 
Well, you could say that. 
Are you gonna tell me 
what happened to your face? 
Mom said not to tell you. 
She... she saw this? 
She came at lunch. 
They called her from school. 
Hmm. 
What happened? 
Got into a fight. 
It's not a big deal. 
Well, who gave it to ya? 
Don't worry about it. 
Jonah... 
Mom... mom said 
she'll take care of it. 
Jonah, who gave it to you? 
You don't need 
Page 5/36

to worry about it. 
Who told you that? 
I just don't want you 
to expect too much 
and be disappointed. 
Why would I be disappointed? 
It's a little sad-looking. 
Come on. 
What do you think? 
Do you believe this? 
Hang on. Let me put my bag down. Come on. 
Well, say something. 
What do you think? 
This is so strange. 
I know. 
Aw, I want to see 
the silly dance. 
Okay. 
Thank you. 
We're gonna have 
a better life now. 
We already do. 
Not just my eyes. 
Everything. 
Even if it is just your eyes. 
I'm gonna get that promotion. 
We can go on vacation. 
We can get a bigger house. 
I like our house. 
One with a big backyard. 
Take you shopping. 
Thank you 
for calling millennium realty. How can I help you? 
They say the point is, 
in Africa, 
when the sun comes up, 
you'd better be running. 
Good afternoon, 
this is rob boucher 
from the millennium 
real estate corporation. 
Is Ms. nepoli at home, please? Page 6/36

Oh, good. 
I just want to make sure... 
Can you believe this? Really? 
When that guy was sitting 
at this desk, 
he didn't move a single house. I've been here longer. 
I've put many more houses 
on the board. 
Why is he the boss? 
No, seriously. 
A simple question. 
When that guy was sitting here, he didn't do squat. 
- Okay? 
- Bob. 
Yeah? 
Hello? 
My name is James Harvey, 
I'm calling 
from millennium realty... 
How are you doing today, 
Mr. Dixon? 
Fine, Bob, how are you? 
You're doing a great job. 
Thank you. 
- Really great. 
- You, too. 
Thank you. 
Am I gonna get my own room? 
Nope. 
Hi. 
Um... 
We have a reservation. 
Have any cream on my face? 
Hmm? 
No, you're good. 
Okay. 
- Can you hold this? 
- Sure. 
Comin'? 
Come on! 
It's beautiful. 
What are you doing in there? 
Page 7/36
Stop spending time 
in front of the mirror. 
Hey. 
Mmm. 
Mmm. 
Oh, I've tried 
for a long, long time 
tried to find a guy 
that I could call mine 
a good man, my baby, my baby 
is so very hard to find 
mm-hmm 
need someone to love 
I relax 
and act like the happy girl 
I've never seen anything 
like this. 
You don't vacation much. 
I don't do much of anything. 
It's one of those things 
that feels better than it looks. Mm-hmm 
I think I know what you mean. 
Need someone to love 
I'm here with my wife and son. I'm here with my husband. 
I should probably 
go check on them upstairs. 
But I've waited, 
yes, I've waited 
so very, very, very 
alone inside me 
sometimes I wonder 
Would you like to dance with me? Sure. 
Come our way 
one day I will know 
if my wish will come true 
I'm gonna find 
a good man to love 
just like you 
I hope it's real, 
so, yes, I do 
but until I do 
Page 8/36
mm-hmm 
need someone to love 
oh, I know, I know, 
i know, girl 
need someone to love 
I'll drop you guys off at home and take the car 
and go grocery shopping. 
Oh, man, I do not feel 
like going back to work. 
I wish we could just stay there for the rest of our lives. 
It would be nice, wouldn't it? Can I ask you something? 
What? 
Did Jonah ever 
get in fights before? 
What do you mean before? 
You know, this year. 
He's 13. 
They get into fights 
all the time. 
I mean, serious fights. 
Honey... 
Black eyes and stuff. 
You never told me. 
Never that bad. No. 
It is 8: 
Excuse me. 
Hello, my name is James Harvey, and I'm calling from... 
Good afternoon, 
this is Robert boucher. 
Mr. abbott, I'm calling 
from millennium realty... 
I was just wondering if, uh... You might have seen 
a mailer from us. 
Maybe we have to start 
with the market as a whole. 
Just give me a second. 
Hello. 
Mr. umberto, 
Page 9/36
it's James Harvey, 
millennium realty. 
Yes, I wanted to call 
and let you know 
that in the next few months 
about a dozen houses 
in your neighborhood 
are gonna be foreclosed. 
And once the bank forecloses 
those houses, 
the overall property value 
for the block goes down. 
Pretty soon what you had, what you have now, isn't worth much. Split it between these. 
So, I'm calling you 
today with an offer. 
It's not going to knock you 
off your feet, but it's fair. 
It's fair, and it will help you find another place to live. 
So, let's start by doing this, can you write a number down? 
I'm gonna give you 
my personal number. 
This is not a company extension. I'm not calling you from India. You can call me anytime, 
I'll be with you 
through this process. 
I'm your point man, 
I'm your guy. 
Now, the only question 
that remains, Mr. umberto, is... Do you have a pen? 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
So... I went on a 
date last night. 
Really? 
- With who? 
- Well... How'd you meet? 
You didn't tell us. 
She was great, you know? 
Page 10/36
She's... Smart. 
Attentive, thoughtful. 
But on the heavy side. 
That's great, Bob. 
Bit on the heavy side? 
You think it's serious? 
What's that mean? 
I don't know. 
Why not? 
We had, uh, a little argument. You know, she said she'd rather be deaf than blind. 
Oh, Bob, can't you sit 
with a woman for five minutes 
without bringing that one up? 
Oh, damn, do you ask her that? It's really about communicating, you know? 
I mean, think about... 
Think about music. 
The meal is important. Oh, boy. Hey. Somebody gotta represent. Now that you deserted us. 
Who deserted who? 
Bob, I didn't 
desert you. I'm still there. 
Hmm, sure are. 
Hear about your husband's 
new-found work ethic? 
He's the star of the office. 
Really? 
How many deals 
did you make, dad? 
- Jonah! 
- Not enough. 
Come on, James. 
Let's get 
a little competition goin'. 
Yeah, come on, dad. How many? 
- Dad? 
- Come on. 
- Guys, please dig into the pie. - You and me. 
It's going to get cold. 
Page 11/36
About three. 
Oh, come on, dad. 
You have to be specific. 
How many? 
Where did you put the...? 
Oh, never mind, I found it. 
- How many? 
- Jonah, stop it. 
Come on, I wanna know. 
How many? 
How many deals you make? 
Can we not talk 
about work at the dinner table? Thank you! 
Oh, who wants coffee or tea? 
Come eat your pie. 
Come here. 
- What? 
- Come here. 
I want to show you something. 
Come here. Come here. 
You see it? 
See? 
Yeah? 
I got the promotion. 
I didn't want to say anything in front of him, he'll know Monday. - That's great. 
- You like it? 
What's the matter? 
You didn't tell me! 
Oh, I wanted it 
to be a surprise. 
Aren't you happy? 
Yeah! Of course. 
It's almost double. 
Do they know you can't drive? 
I'm gonna learn. 
I'm just worried 
you'll hurt yourself. 
Sam. 
No, we don't know anything. 
What if you... 
Lose it while you're driving? 
Page 12/36
What do you want me to do? 
You want me to sit and wait? 
You should be happy. 
I am happy. 
Don't worry so much. 
I'm just scared, you know? 
You don't wanna lose control. 
That's not true. 
Why would you say that? 
Everything okay in here? 
Yeah. Bob, let me, uh, 
let me drive you home. 
Where do you get all this from? Where are we going? 
I didn't do anything! 
Mr. Harvey... 
You can't blame Jonah every time he and Billy forley 
get in a fight, 
i will not stand for it. 
You will not punish my son 
unjustly. 
I have three other students 
who say your son started it. 
Those are all Billy's friends. Mr. Harvey, 
don't barge into my office 
and tell me 
how to run my school. 
Fine. 
I won't tell you how to run it, but you don't punish my son 
when he isn't responsible 
for the problem. 
That was awesome. 
Come on, let's get out of here. I have fifth period. 
Ah, come on. 
- Really? 
- Yeah, let's go. 
Oh, now he's gone. 
Move really slow. 
Hey, there's one. 
Is that one? 
Page 13/36
Oh, yeah. 
He's curled 
like half underneath the rock. Ah! 
Where'd he go? 
Let's look up under here. 
See any? 
No. 
But there's a fish, though. 
Where? 
There. There he is. 
Oh, yeah. 
Maybe more up here? 
Maybe over there. 
You know, you don't 
have to go back there 
if you don't want to. 
We can send you someplace else. You know, private school. 
We can't afford it. 
You let me worry about that. 
Who wants to, anyway? 
You think there's no 
Billy forleys at woodland? 
At least the bullies 
there will be better dressed. 
It's okay, dad. 
I'm gonna tough it out. 
Oh, yeah? 
Oh, you wanna tough it out, 
do ya? 
Wanna tough it out? 
You wanna tough it out? 
Oh, yeah! 
Stop! 
25 funded at closing, 
for the development 
of a 50-home residential 
neighborhood project 
in Montgomery county. 
The first mortgage loan 
represents an underwritten, 
loan to net sellout 
of approximately 68 percent. 
Page 14/36

And has been underwritten 
to generate an irr 
of approximately... 
Five percent. 
We're not pushing hard enough. We can increase marketing spend. We flyer every block. 
We go door to door. 
We... cold call. 
We have a local office 
for each community. 
But we've already been 
doing all of that. 
We can do more. 
The problem isn't 
getting to people. 
People know we're out there. 
But we know what the problem is. The problem is trust. 
People think we're a cold 
blooded real estate company. 
That's a good thing, right? 
I'm just telling you 
what I've been hearing 
for the past seven years... 
Working the phones. 
We're no more cold-blooded 
than Franklin and Howard 
or any of the others. 
That's right, 
and they're all struggling, too. We need to reposition our brand. Become the good guys. 
I thought we are the good guys. Oh, what are you suggesting? 
You want to start a charity? 
Would that be so bad? 
Listen, I hate having to... 
Oh, don't worry. 
I'll take care of it. 
What if they say no? 
Are you really asking me that? Okay, 
so I'll tell him to expect you. Page 15/36

Yeah, you do that. 
And what does 
the golden boy want? 
Lunch. 
Oh, I don't lunch. 
Lunch with me? 
Why should I? 
I wanna talk about this. 
This what? 
This challenge. 
You wanna share ideas? 
I do. 
Why? 
I... could use your help. 
And why should I help you? 
I think you could use 
my perspective. 
Look. 
Golden boy, you just flipped 
a couple of houses, 
got yourself promoted. 
Don't let it go to your head. 
I don't see 
why we had to come here. 
I wanted to take you out. 
What's wrong with dancing? 
Sure, we'll go dancing. 
Let me get the check. 
No, no, no. It's fine. 
Sam. 
What's wrong? 
I heard what you did 
at Jonah's school. 
The kid needed a break. 
Well... 
I called them and told them 
to give him detention. 
You what? 
He can't cut class and... 
I gave him my permission. 
You don't get to do that! 
Why not? 
Because you don't 
get to make the decision 
Page 16/36
for both of us! 
Really? 
Because you never used 
to tell me 
when he got in trouble 
at school. 
I didn't want to bother you 
with that. 
Well, now I know. 
What's that supposed to mean? 
Now I know. 
I don't like this. 
Let's go dancing. 
- I don't want to. 
- No, let's go. 
Come on, Sam. 
- James... 
- We'll start over. 
Go ahead. 
Everyone knows 
the market is bad. 
The woman cleaning your house 
knows the market is bad. 
People tell themselves, 
"I'd have to be an idiot 
to sell now." 
So, we establish 
a separate consulting entity. 
We hold meetings in schools, 
community centers, churches. 
We help people manage debt. 
And we offer our own solution. People will show up 
just because it's church. 
Evening classes 
in family finance. 
They'll come in droves. 
What we offer: 
A comprehensive plan 
for solving debt. 
Consolidating, 
making a family budget, 
paying off small debts first. 
Page 17/36
One of the solutions 
we'll be selling. 
What do you think? 
I think he's got a point. 
So close to one today. 
I don't know. 
You know, that split... 
That split-second 
where they're not sure 
if they're gonna sign 
on the dotted line or not. 
I blew it. 
I don't know. 
I think my mind wandered 
a little bit. 
How do you close? 
- How do you close? 
- Yeah. 
You look the guy 
right in the eye. 
And you say, 
"are you willing to do this?" 
Hey, dad. 
Hey. 
Hey. 
What are you doin' up? 
Mom said you went to a party 
and didn't take her. 
Go to bed. 
How was it? 
Fine. 
Have fun? 
You told Jonah 
i didn't want you to come 
but I... I did ask you. 
Doesn't matter. 
Can I ask you something? 
That first time we met. 
At the dance 
at the community center. 
What about it? 
Why me? Why did you...? 
Why did you choose me? 
You looked unhappy. 
Page 18/36
I thought I could help. 
Well, usually, 
when you ask someone to dance, it's because you're 
attracted to them. 
Well, you looked miserable 
out there. 
We're the sorry-looking 
group of blind people... 
In the sorry-looking 
community center. 
You pitied me. 
No, I didn't. 
You pitied me at the party 
for the blind. 
You pitied me, 
and you took me on, 
like one of those kids 
at your school. 
Project. 
Stop it. 
Pitiful sight. 
I'll go dancing tomorrow 
because I promised. 
But I'm never going there again. Ooh, baby 
ooh, baby 
when we're 
out in the moonlight 
looking up on stars above 
feels so good 
when I'm near you 
holding hands 
and making love 
ooh, ooh, baby 
yes, oh, baby 
yes, oh, baby 
yes, oh, baby 
Sandy beach 
and was making love 
as the tide moves in on us 
feels so good 
walking side by side 
want to be with you all 
Page 19/36
my life 
ooh, ooh, baby 
yes, oh, baby 
yes, oh, baby 
yes, oh, baby 
ooh, baby 
dreams of you all the time 
feels so good 
when we're together, love 
just can't wait 
until tomorrow night 
If you leave, 
you can't come back. 
Hey, baby, let's shake it 
You know that, right? 
Ooh, ooh, baby 
Where are you taking me? 
Come on, 
I'll show you the water. 
So... 
Yeah, of course, 
this is where you live. 
I used to smell 
your perfume in the elevator. 
Do you know that? 
Every morning. 
Oh. 
People are looking 
for someone to tell them 
how to get out of debt. 
They're starving for this stuff. Yeah, but why here? 
Where else do people go 
in hard times? 
We... we really 
just want to help. 
Bob will be leading 
these meetings. 
Now, primarily we want you 
to see us as a source 
of information. 
And we want you 
to ask us any question at all. Nothing is off bounds. 
Page 20/36
Absolutely nothing. 
Um, we also want you to know 
that we can refer you to... 
Uh, financial services. 
Just purely as a last resort, 
in case you want to have, uh, 
your house reevaluated. 
Um... 
I think that, um... 
I'm pretty sure there's 
a number on this pamphlet. 
Now, I'd like to introduce 
a dear friend and partner 
in new day alliance, 
James Harvey. 
Good job, Bob. 
Gee, thanks. 
You want to step here. 
You good? 
Thank you, Bob! 
And thank you all 
for being here. 
A man... 
Prays to god... 
For 50 years. 
The same prayer, every night. 
God... 
Please let me win the lottery. Every night, year after year, 
after year, after year. 
"Please... god... 
Let me win the lottery." 
And finally an angel 
goes to god. 
And he says, "god..." 
This man has been 
praying so long." 
"Why don't you let him win"? 
And you know what god says? 
God says, 
"I'd love to help him out." 
"Love to help him out." 
"But he's never bought 
a lottery ticket!" 
Page 21/36
Now, I look into this crowd, 
and I see different faces. 
I see old men and women. 
I see young couples. 
Single mothers. 
Young men. 
Whole families. 
Why are you all here? 
Why are you all here? 
It's because of your addiction. Your addiction to debt. 
To the economy of debt. 
To never picking up 
when that unlisted number 
flashes on your phone. 
To waking up in the morning 
and dodging phone calls. 
And red letters. 
And finally, 
to sitting at home in the dark so you can't get served. 
So we go, and we pray. 
And we cry. 
And we feel sorry for ourselves. And why? Why do we do that? 
It's because we don't 
have the guts to take action. 
To get out of debt. 
To sell that car. 
To move to a smaller house. 
To get that ticket. 
We got debt 
because we can't get jobs. 
So we come up with excuses. 
"I can't get a job." 
"I make too little, 
the money is too low." 
"I can't move ahead." 
And... and maybe that's right. Maybe you're stuck. 
Maybe the money is low. 
I mean, we all have 
these problems, right? 
We all have these problems. 
Page 22/36
Then, why do we feel it right 
to live beyond our means? 
Why should we live 
beyond our earnings? 
What sense does it make 
when we're stuck, 
15 years down the line, 
shackled with debt? 
Debt hanging down our throats. Does the bank care 
about your hard life? 
- No. 
- No. 
Do they care 
about your low income? 
- No. 
- No, they don't! 
No, they don't! 
So are you 
enjoying the promotion? 
I guess we can help 
these people out, you know? 
You know, if this keeps up, 
I can definitely get you 
another raise. 
Maybe your own office? 
How's the new apartment? 
Uh, it's... it's great. 
Hey, you should 
come by sometime. 
What's it like? 
What? 
With her. 
What's it like with her? 
Oh. 
Bob, I don't know if I want to... Come on. 
What does she do? 
She do anything special for ya? Come on. Tell... tell... 
Tell me something. 
She's good. 
It's good. 
Better be. 
Page 23/36
It better be good. 
I've been, uh, over to see Sam. Oh, yeah? How come? 
Um... um, I'm her friend, too. Right? I mean, she... 
She had it hard enough. 
Oh, I know. 
I know. 
James, I'm not judging. 
I'm not judging. 
Oh, no, of course not. 
No. 
Like you wouldn't have 
done the same thing 
if you had the chance. 
What chance? 
Oh, please. I need... 
I need to spell it out? 
Yeah. 
Yes, spell it out. 
Spell it out in braille for me. The chance to get what you want. To finally go somewhere 
after years of misery. 
Hmm. 
I didn't realize 
that things were so bad. 
When you were like me. 
Oh, I didn't mean that. 
No? 
A lot of people have it 
a lot worse, you know? 
Bob, you were the one 
who would always complain. 
"Hmm, this guy got promoted, 
why not me?" 
"I've... I've been here forever." "I'm better at this 
than everybody else." 
I don't know if i 
would've been planning 
to leave my family, though. 
That might not have been 
part of my plan, 
Page 24/36
leaving the family. 
Listen, that story 
you told me... 
The ticket. 
I got a chance. 
I reached out, and I got it. 
You missed the point 
of the story. 
Oh, am I? 
Yeah, yeah, 
you never got a ticket. 
You had one handed to you. 
You had a ticket handed to you. So, you're asking, "why not me"? Hmm? 
Maybe I'm asking, 
"what did you do to deserve it?" You're jealous. 
You are jealous. 
And you're being an asshole. 
I'm human. 
Bob. 
Oh. 
That's what it is. Okay. 
Got it. 
In case you didn't hear that, 
i just paid. 
How have you been feeling? 
Your performance 
doesn't go unnoticed. 
The effort you're putting in. 
The results. 
Feels good to contribute. 
I know what you want to hear. 
That we're going 
to expand the program, 
someone will have to run it, 
get a substantial promotion, 
find the right staff. 
You'd be my first choice. 
Thank you. 
And this is probably 
the first order of business. 
I found this on my windshield 
Page 25/36
this morning. 
Not something we wanna 
take lightly. Not now. 
I'll take care of it. 
As quickly as you can? 
Sure. 
We need to talk. 
It's me. 
I know. 
Why are you doing this? 
- Doin' what? 
- Oh, come on, Bob! 
Why are you doing this 
to me, huh? 
Not really about you, James. 
It's all those people 
we're stepping on. 
Oh, don't pretend this is 
about the people. 
Huh? 
You were making phone calls 
screwing people over 
well before any of this! 
Only difference is 
you sucked at it! 
No, this is about you and me 
and your inability 
to cope with where I'm going! 
That's right. 
It's James against the world. 
Have you always felt singled out like this? 
You are so jealous! 
You think I don't know 
how you feel about Sam? Huh? 
You should go to church 
more often, 
outside of office hours, James. If I find one more 
of these things 
around the neighborhood, 
you will lose your job! 
Try and find a new job 
in this economy, Bob. 
Page 26/36
As a former blind man, 
i can tell you it's not easy. 
"But he's never bought 
a lottery ticket." 
Now, I look into this crowd, 
and I see different faces. 
I see old men and women. 
I see young couples. 
Single mothers. 
I see young men. Whole families! But why are you all here? 
Why are you all here? 
It's because of your addiction. Your addiction to debt. 
To the economy of debt. 
To never picking up 
when that unlisted number 
flashes on your phone. 
To waking up in the morning 
and dodging phone calls. 
And red letters. 
I mean, we all have 
these problems, right? 
Then, why do we feel it right 
to live beyond our means? 
Why should we live 
beyond our earnings? 
What sense does it make 
when we're stuck, 
15 years down the line, 
shackled with debt? 
Debt hanging down our throats. Does the bank care 
about your hard life? 
All: 
Do... do they care 
about your low income? 
All: 
No. 
They don't. 
Excuse me! 
Excuse me, sir. 
Page 27/36
How soon can I get the money, 
once I sell the house? 
Oh, um. 
Well, you'll 
get a check right away. 
Cash? 
Well, you can cash that check. Yeah. 
Maybe you should think about it, you know? It's a big decision. I... I realize that, I just... Is there, um, any way to move 
to the front of the line 
with this? 
Take my card, and, um... 
I want you to think about it... More. 
You promise? 
And if you're still sure, uh... Give me a call. 
Thank you so much. 
How's mom? 
She's fine. 
She's... Going crazy 
with the exercising. 
Mmm. 
She's like 
a complete gym freak now. 
Yeah, she's always liked 
getting into new stuff. 
Hey, dad. 
I think it's good, 'cause... 
Exercise creates endorphins. 
I think that's 
really good for her. 
Yeah. 
She goes dancing, too. 
Oh yeah? 
At the svi? 
Oh, who with? 
What's wrong? 
Oh, nothing. 
I'm losing my novelty? 
No. 
Page 28/36

It's not that. 
Oh? 
It's always that. 
I think Jonah's 
got a girlfriend now. 
And he says he doesn't 
want to stay here. 
Oh. 
It's gonna take time. 
I know. 
My dad left when I was nine. 
You get used to it. 
I think my parents 
stayed together 
just 'cause I was going blind. I used to hear my dad 
praying every night 
for my vision 
not to get any worse. 
Is... is he still alive? 
No. 
It was so important to him. 
You know, I used to... 
Lie about it. 
I used to tell him I could still see things when I couldn't. 
He took it way harder 
than I ever did. 
She never let me be 
who I wanted. 
Nobody's judging you. 
Maybe god is. 
Mmm. God has 
better things to do. 
You don't believe in god? 
Oh, when... things are bad. 
When I need to believe, 
i believe. 
That's not what belief is. 
Well, then, I don't believe. 
Hey! 
Hey. 
What are you doing here? 
Just gonna give you the check. Page 29/36

Oh. 
You could've just mailed it. 
You're running now? 
- Yeah. 
- You look good. 
Yeah. 
Gotta stay in shape 
for all the handsome 
new men in my life. 
Just came to see 
how you were doing. 
Thanks for coming by. 
You know, I'm 
a little worried about, uh... 
About Jonah. 
Why? 
I don't know, he seems... 
He seems different. 
Any trouble? 
- Troubles? 
- Yeah? 
It's called, you know, 
going through a skater phase. 
It's a part of growing up. 
Yeah. 
The skater phase, 
i guess, I never... 
Never saw that. 
Yeah, that and the whole thing with his father moving out. 
House looks nice. 
I'm gonna... get showered up. 
Head inside so... 
Can I come in? 
No. 
Dad... 
What's wrong? 
Hey, Jonah. 
What are you doing here? 
I never noticed how this house glows at night. 
You can see it 
from down the street. 
Hey. 
Page 30/36
I... I have to get back inside. Yeah. 
Yeah. 
Mom's at the dance. 
Up north 
That night. 
And I had to go the bathroom. 
Up north 
where the people smile 
their grimy smiles 
one place 
that I lug around 
- Maybe later, though. 
- Bob, Bob, James is here. 
One place 
I'm not going to do it. 
there's no other town 
Just give us a minute, okay? 
Oh, god. Tell me it's okay. 
All right. 
One place 
Thanks. 
That I lug around 
get over 
up north 
dirty streets 
You know, I used to think 
i came here for you. 
- That's not true. 
- up north 
I came here for me. 
Funny how everything works out in the end, don't you think? 
Me moving on 
and you showing up here. 
Bob's a good dancer. 
Don't worry, we're just dancing. I wouldn't 
take your only friend. 
Up north 
You should bring her here 
sometime. 
She might like it. 
Up north 
Page 31/36
that I've missed so much 
Can I have this dance? 
Well... 
Everything looks normal. 
That reporter called again. 
What does she want? 
To speak to somebody in charge. You shouldn't be 
taking those calls. 
P.R. 
You're not doing too good. 
No. 
Not now. Not now. 
Not now. 
Not now. Please. 
No. 
No. 
We're adding a $104 credit 
for the oil 
left in your heating. 
That would be fine. 
Here we are, then. 
Here's the deed of sale, 
all filled out. 
For the townhouse 
at the 207 property. 
This looks right. 
We just need you to sign here. I am deeply satisfied 
with my life 
and everything in it. 
I live for today, 
and I enjoy what I do. 
I do not compare myself 
to others. 
I'm thankful 
for everything I have. 
I am deeply satisfied 
with my life... 
And everything in it. 
I live for today, 
and I enjoy what I do. 
I do not compare myself 
to others. 
Page 32/36
When were you going to tell me? Do you think people 
won't notice? 
What are you going to do? 
Keep it a secret? 
Pretend you can see? 
I can take care of this. 
I can help you. 
I don't need your help. 
Yes, you do. 
I can fix this. 
How? 
James, let me help you. 
I don't need your help. 
Thank you all for being here. 
A man prays to god... 
For 50 years. 
The same prayer, every night. 
"God, please let me 
win the lottery." 
Every single night. 
Year after year. 
"Please, god..." 
"Let me win the lottery." 
And finally an angel 
goes to god, 
and he says, 
"god, this man has been 
praying so long." 
"Why don't you let him win?" 
And god says, 
"I'd love to help him," 
but he's never bought... 
"A lottery ticket." 
I look into this crowd, 
and I see different faces. 
I see old men and women. 
I see young couples. 
I see whole families.. 
Now, why are you all here? 
Why are you all here? 
I used to live like you. 
I used to live like you. 
I was saddled with debt. 
Page 33/36
And now... 
Waste of time. 
And I'm not... Anymore. 
I talked to Dixon. 
He can take 
your responsibilities. 
Ease off the load. 
I'm thankful 
for everything I have. 
Deeply satisfied with my life 
and everything in it. 
I live for today, 
and I enjoy what I do. 
I do not compare myself 
to others. 
I'm thankful for what I have. 
I'm deeply satisfied with 
my life and everything in it. 
I live for the moment. 
I enjoy what I do. 
I do not compare myself 
to others. 
Oh, god, god, god. 
God... god, forgive... Oh, god! Please, god. 
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
I'm sorry. 
Please, god! Please, god! 
Please... please. Please, god. I'm fucked! 
Oh, god! 
Please, god. Please, god. 
Please, god! 
Oh, god! 
Please, god. Please, help me. 
Please, god. Please! 
Please. I'm sorry. 
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
Please, I'm sorry. 
I'm sorry. 
I'm sorry! 
I'm sorry. 
I'm sorry. 
I'm sorry, please. 
Page 34/36
Please, god. 
Please, god. 
Please, I'm sorry. 
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
I'm sorry. Forgive me. 
Forgive me. 
Please, god, please! 
Please! Please! Please! 
Please! Please! Please! 
Oh, god! Oh, god! 
Please, god! 
Please! 
Oh, god. 
Oh, god! 
Bob! 
Bob, are you there? 
Bob, I know you're there. 
Bob, please! 
Please open up, Bob! 
Bob? 
Bob? 
Bob, please. 
Bob? 
Bob, please. 
You have everything I want. 
Everything I ever wanted. 
And you messed it up! 
Bob? 
What, you think she's 
gonna take you back now? 
God! 
You're no good. 
You think she deserves you? 
You know, 
she still protects you? 
She still understands you. 
So, won't you crawl 
on back to her. 
Huh? 
Crawl on home. 
Get the hell out of my house. 
Get out! 
My god. 
I'm sorry. 
Page 35/36
Are you okay? 
- James? 
- I'm sorry. 
Do you need me to call a doctor? - Are you...? 
- No, no. 
No. 
You smell so good. 
You can't do this to me. 
I can't take you back. 
You know that. 
Shh... 
Shh... 
Shh...
