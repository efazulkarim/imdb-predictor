EXT. PUDONG SKYLINE - SUNRISE
 The silhouette of the majestic Pearl Tower tells us we are in  
SHANGHAI, just as day breaks.  TWO BLACKED-OUT SUVs glide 
through a city that’s at once both ancient and modern.
 The CONVOY passes:
 The lights of Nanjing Road, shutting off with the dawn...  
Students practicing sunrise Tai Chi along the Huangpu river... 
The CONVOY continues past:
 Antique vendors on Dongtai Road, setting up for the day’s 
business...  
Eager chefs negotiating with seasoned fishermen for the prize 
catch at a local fish market...
 EXT. THE DONGHAI BRIDGE - CONTINUED
 The TWO SUVs cut through a morning fog that gives this bridge 
the appearance of stretching to infinity...
 EXT. YANGSHAN PORT - CONTINUED
 The JOURNEY ENDS at one of the world’s busiest ports, where 
both SUVs come to a STOP, and the RED-CARPET BOARDING STAIRS 
of an AUGUSTA-WESTLAND AW101 HELICOPTER - the most expensive 
rotorcraft ever made - beckons all to board.
 EXT. HELIPAD, YANGSHUN PORT - MOMENTS LATER
 The helicopter lifts off, leaving the port and its off-shore 
wind turbines behind.  And heading out to sea...
 EXT. A WHALE WATCHING BOAT - OFF OF HAINAN ISLAND 
Tourists, angling to get the best photographs of a pod of 
whales, HARDLY NOTICE THE HELICOPTER as it speeds by...
 EXT. SANYA BAY BEACHES - HAINAN ISLAND
 And neither do the sun-worshipping beachgoers, nor the high
spirited water lovers who surf the breaks. 
Only a LONE BOY looks up, shielding his eyes from the sun, to 
admire the HELICOPTER as it speeds by over the lush, tropical 
isle and heads out INTO THE VAST PACIFIC...
 A WOMAN’S VOICE 
Imagine going to the moon...
2.
 EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY
 The Helicopter flies low across the surface of the water.  
Endless blue as far as the eye can see....
 A WOMAN’S VOICE 
But instead of it being a lifeless 
void, it was teeming with creatures 
so exotic, they boggle the mind.
 INT. AUGUSTA-WESTLAND AW101 HELICOPTER - DAY
 The voice belongs to PRESCA MORRIS, an immaculately dressed, 
incredibly charismatic businesswoman.  She’s speaking to her 
passengers for the day:  EIGHT INTERNATIONAL VIPs -(whose 
personal fortunes come from American oil money, Mexican 
telecom, Brazilian Manufacturing, and Indian petrochemicals)
 MORRIS (CONT’D)
 Imagine exploring an alien world, 
whose scale dwarfs the highest of 
mountains, the grandest of canyons.  
Now imagine, instead of this being 
a fantasy, instead of it being a 
journey that would take years to 
complete, you could do it right 
here, right now.  Ladies and 
Gentlemen, I welcome you, our first 
outside guests, to Mana-One.
 THROUGH THE LARGE CABIN WINDOWS
 The VIPs see MANA-ONE, a PLATFORM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN.  
It’s industrial-looking, sits low in the water, and is little 
more than a wide, square landing area with docks/sub
launching arms protruding from each of its four sides.
 TEXAS VIP
 (disappointed, to his Wife)
 That’s it?
 EXT. HELICOPTER / EXT. MANA-ONE - MOMENTS LATER
 Morris leads the VIPs across the deck, heading for the only 
visible structure, a BANK OF ELEVATORS, that sticks up on the 
otherwise flat platform, like some kind of design mistake.
 MRS. TEXAS VIP
 (to Morris)
 Obviously, when you get closer to 
completion, you’re gonna do this 
up, right?
3.
 MORRIS
 (smiling)
 No.
 No?  Did they hear that right?  The ELEVATOR door opens, and 
if the VIPs thought that the platform was disappointing...
 INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUED
 ...Then the ELEVATOR takes that to another level.  It’s a 
massive freight lift - the kind you’d find in a garment 
warehouse.  The only clue that there is something more going 
on here is that Morris is holding out STICKS OF-
MORRIS
 Chewing gum, anyone?  For your 
ears.  I recommend it.  The first 
time down can be a bit much.
 And so this group of people, collectively worth 1/4 of a 
TRILLION DOLLARS, take sticks of 99-cent chewing gum. 
TEXAS VIP
 Are we on candid camera or 
something?
 Morris selects the “O” floor, using an old-fashion hand-crank 
selector.  DOWN they go.  Fast. 
MORRIS
 Your ears are popping because, even 
though the station is normalized, 
pressure changes underwater are much 
greater than they are in the air.  A 
Scuba diver, rising from the depth 
we’re going to, would have to spend 
hours in a decompression tank or die 
a painful death.  Then again, no 
scuba diver has ever been as deep as 
you’re about to be.
 They reach the O-level.  The elevator stops with a LURCH.  
MORRIS
 Your gum?
 Morris holds out a CHEAP PLASTIC CONTAINER for those who want 
to get rid of their gum.  That’s the last straw for TEXAS. 
TEXAS VIP
 I’ve got to be honest with you, Ms. 
Morris.  So far I find this whole 
thing profoundly underwhelming-
4.--as if on cue the ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN to reveal A HUMPBACK 
WHALE gliding gracefully by right in front of them.  ITS SONG 
fills the elevator as A SECOND HUMPBACK, a BABY, slides by.
 MINWAY ZHANG (O.S.)
 Then it’s a good thing it’s not the 
elevator you’re here to see.
 DR. MINWAY ZHANG - 60s, but brimming with the enthusiasm of a 
child, has been waiting for them here on the-
INT. OBSERVATION LEVEL (O-LEVEL) - MANA #1 - DAY
 An all-glass world
 - shaped like a massive horizontal bicycle 
wheel.  Its six “spokes” are corridors, and its “rim” is more 
than 1/4 mile around in its entirety.  The result is a view 
of sea life in every direction.  A 360 degree aquarium called 
the Pacific Ocean.
 MINWAY ZHANG
 You are looking at something few 
people have ever seen.  Life 1,000 
feet beneath the surface...
 Standing next to Zhang, his granddaughter MEIYING, 8, seems 
to take delight in watching the VIPs’ jaws drop.
 ZHANG
 On behalf of my granddaughter, 
Meiying, I welcome you to the 
Observation Level.  A structure 
designed with the knowledge that 
nothing man makes will ever compete 
with the majesty of the sea.
 INT. OBSERVATION LEVEL (O-LEVEL) - MANA #1 - DAY
 END CREDITS
 We WALK with the group as Zhang leads them around a portion 
of the O-Level. Pausing to point out certain species of sea 
life as they make appearances outside the glass.  
ZHANG
 Mana-one’s location, on the edge of 
a tectonic shelf, means we get an 
incredible variety of aquatic life.  
From something as common as the 
Bluefin Tuna... 
(two 800-lbs glide by)
 ...to something as rare and 
spectacular as...
 ...He nods for Meiying to identify what she sees outside:
MEIYING
 5.
 (excited)
 An oarfish!
 Gasps are heard as the VIPs see AN OARFISH: a 35-ft long 
silvery ribbon of life with a dragon’s head.  
INDIAN VIP
 This is incredible, Dr. Zhang.  
BRAZILIAN VIP
 Truly spectacular.
 TEXAS VIP
 How long ‘til you open up to paying 
customers?
 Zhang looks to Morris.  Those details are her department.
 MORRIS
 Ten months.  In addition to this 
level, we’re building a restaurant 
we think has the world’s greatest 
view, a hospital-quality infirmary, 
and most importantly, a gift shop.
 That gets laughs.
 ZHANG
 For years, I’ve traveled the world, 
urging people to take better care 
of the sea.  My hope is now, by 
bringing the world here, the sea 
will speak for itself.
 There is some spontaneous applause for the achievement.  
MORRIS
 (Prompting Zhang)
 So, it’s no accident we invited you 
all here today...
 ZHANG
 ...Yes. As you may remember, Mana
One is built where it is to give us 
access to the deepest reaches of 
our planet.  The Marianas Trench.  
Nearly seven miles below the 
surface at its base, the mysteries 
of the trench hold the keys to a 
better understanding of the world 
in which we live. And yet it 
remains a place mankind has seen 
less of than the planet Mars.  Our 
(MORE)

 ZHANG (CONT'D)
 mission is to change that.  Right 
now, as I speak to you, a team of 
our submersibles, including one 
piloted by my daughter, is putting 
the last of our UNIS BOT sensor 
stations in place, 30,000 feet 
below us.  When powered up, these 
BOTS will send back images, the 
likes of which no one has seen 
before.  And we want you, our angel 
investors, to be with us when we 
turn them on for the first time. 
Now everyone is really jazzed.  TEXAS VIP looks at Morris.
 TEXAS VIP
 Well played, little lady.  Well 
played.
 INT.  MANA-1, DIVE CONTROL CENTER - DAY
 WIPE TO:
 Zhang, Morris, Meiying and the VIPs emerge from the elevator 
and find themselves in a Mission-Control like space, known as 
the DIVE CONTROL CENTER (DCC).  A small TEAM OF PERSONNEL 
(who we’ll get to know) is monitoring every aspect of the 
current mission into the trench.  A dazzling array of video 
screens shows us everything from the CREW MEMBERS’ VITAL 
SIGNS, to IMAGES FROM INSIDE THE SUBS, and of course, IMAGES 
OF WHAT’S OUTSIDE THE SUBS.
 A TACTICAL DISPLAY shows a computer representation of the 
dive going on right now.  Two sleek ABYSS GLIDERS (Fastback 1 
and Fastback 2) are orbiting at 20,000 feet down, acting like 
sonar eyes in the sky for the two MULE SUBS (Angel 1 and 
Angel 2) that are actually in the trench placing the last of 
the UNIS BOTS into position.  
The DIVE OPERATIONS CHIEF, James “MAC” Mackriedes, 30s, rough 
around the edges, nods ‘hello’ to the VIPs and then resumes 
what he’s doing. 
JAMES “MAC” MACKRIEDES
 (into a mic)
 Angel one, have you got that last 
bot in position?
 ANGEL ONE, the first of the Mules, is captained by JUNJIE 
Chen and co-piloted by CARL Sheppherd.  We see their cockpit 
on a screen.  There’s a delay between the video and audio:
7.
 JUNJIE/ANGEL ONE (RADIO)
 Standby... Bot is down.  Footpad 
indicators: four greens.  Inertial 
Power Unit: on.  Tether: released.
 The TACTICAL DISPLAY shows ANGEL ONE is no longer tethered to 
its UNIS BOT cargo.  And that the BOT is well-positioned in 
the trench.  This gets the room excited.
 JUNJIE/ANGEL ONE (RADIO)
 Well everyone, it looks like we owe 
Dimitri an apology.  His stuff 
might actually work.
 He’s referring to DIMITRI Karmanov, the handsome, blue-eyed 
Russian Engineer who is watching the dive from a seat next to 
Mac.  Mac pats Dimitri on the back.  Dimitri is emotionless.
 MAC
 Fan, let’s go ahead and ping the 
BOTS so we can start them up.
 This to Linfan “FAN” Chang, 24, a marine biologist whose arms 
are covered in decorative tattoos of mermaids and sea 
creatures.  Fan is Meiying’s favorite team member, (besides 
her mom and grandpa), so it’s no surprise that Meiying has 
joined her at the control panel.  Fan enters a series of 
commands on her keyboard.
 FAN
 Wake-up boys...  Give us a smile...
 ON TACTICAL
 One by one, the two dozen BOTS, which have been placed in 
tandem along a length of the trench, BEGIN TO BLINK.
 FAN
 All Bots responding. Initial 
readings - nominal.  Ready for 
power-up on your command.
 Fan looks at Mac, but then Mac, and everyone, looks at ZHANG.  
This moment is the culmination of years of hard work
 .
 ZHANG
 Go ahead, please.
 Dimitri and Fan rapidly execute a series of keystrokes - then 
reach the final button-push.  Fan turns to MEIYING.  Let’s 
push this last button together.  As they do, Fan says...
 FAN
 Let there be light.
8.
 A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS BETWEEN POVS.
 1) From Junjie’s and Francois’s MULES (Angel One and Two) - 
hovering in the trench.  They stare into the darkness - but 
see NOTHING
 yet.
 2) From an ABYSS GLIDER (Fastback One) orbiting above, 
piloted by SUYIN Zhang -- late 20s, beautiful and brilliant.  
Suyin looks down out the bottom of her glass cockpit.  She 
sees the faint blinking position lights of the two Mules far 
below... But NOTHING
 else.
 BACK IN THE DIVE CONTROL CENTER
 THE TACTICAL DISPLAY shows all BOTS turning from Red to 
Green, meaning they should be on... But...
 FAN
 No visuals from BOT cameras.  No 
data either.
 Is it possible something isn’t working?  Mac looks at 
Dimitri.  Dimitri stares, it will be fine
 .
 MAC
 (nervous, into the mic)
 Angel One, do you have a visual?
 (static)
 Junjie, I say again, do you have a 
visual?
 (static)
 Suyin, can you see anything from up 
where you are?
 Silence.  It’s horrible.  Mac is about to speak again when-
JUNJIE/ANGEL ONE (RADIO)--Mana-One, confirmed.  The BOTS 
are working...
 JUNJIE’S POV
 In the inky black reaches just below him, he now sees a 
series of BRIGHT WHITE LIGHTS - orbs in the darkness.
 JUNJIE/ANGEL ONE
 Not sure our cameras will do them 
justice.  From here it looks like 
someone dropped the two most 
beautiful diamond necklaces you 
ever saw.
9.
 SUYIN’S POV
 From up here, it almost looks like an airport runway at 
night.  Suyin breaks into a big smile.
 SUYIN
 Congratulations, father.  You did it.
 INT.  DIVE CONTROL CENTER 
Applause breaks out.  Zhang, beaming...
 ZHANG
 We did it.  All of us.
 FAN
 And we have visuals.  Welcome, 
everyone, to the most exotic place 
on planet Earth...
 The VISUALS begin to explode onto the DCC SCREENS.  This is 
the Marianas Trench as we have never seen it.  CORAL TOWERS 
reach skyward like church spires.  ACTIVE VOLCANOES spew 
plumes of deadly sulfur.  And STRANGE, ALIEN CREATURES haunt 
the waters.  Bleach white cephalopods, invertebrates.  Then----A SCREAM FROM ONE OF THE VIPs WHEN an ANGLER FISH appears 
on screen, like something out of a nightmare!  That gives 
everyone a good scare.  Then more LAUGHS.
 ZHANG
 Have no fear.  That Angler Fish is 
only 6 inches long.  And it’s six 
miles beneath us.
 There’s a MOMENT where everyone just marvels at what they 
see.  Is that a tear in ZHANG’S eye?  MAC and HELLER embrace.  
FAN reaches out and surreptitiously SQUEEZES DIMITRI’S HAND - 
a secret romance between the fiery gal and icy Russian.
 PING...  
Amidst the celebratory laughs, a lone SONAR PING.
 And then another... 
PING...
 FAN (MIC)
 Fastbacks One and Two.  You guys 
see that?
10.
 INT. FASTBACK ONE - SUYIN - SAME
 Suyin looks around.  Her glass cockpit has a HEADS-UP DISPLAY 
projected on it.  And sure enough it is picking up SOMETHING 
moving fast, north to south, high to low, in the TRENCH. The 
sub’s computer puts a little box around the ‘target’ even 
though it can’t actually be seen.
 SUYIN
 Copy that, Mana-One.  I have one... 
Make that two targets...
 More BOXES appear... Indicating more targets...  But then 
some disappear and re-appear...  It’s really weird.
 SUYIN
 DJ, you picking this up?
 INT. FASTBACK TWO - DJ - SAME
 “DJ” LAU, late 20s, a guy who exudes ‘cool’ in every way.  DJ 
flips a quarter through the fingers of his left hand, while 
piloting his ship with his right.
 DJ
 My sonar’s lighting up like a Vegas 
casino.  It’s got to be electrical 
interference.
 INT. FASTBACK ONE - CONTINUED
 Suyin can think of one OTHER possibility.
 SUYIN
 Angels one and two - suggest ascend 
500 meters - there might be a rock 
slide heading your way.
 INT.  DIVE CONTROL CENTER - CONTINUED
 Rock slide?  The smile from Mac’s face vanishes.  
FAN
 Our sonar’s picking up nothing.  
And there’s no indication of 
seismic activity.
 DIMITRI
 (looks at Mac)
 You worry too much.  It’s 
interference, nothing more-
Suddenly -- SMASH -- THERE IS A BLACK SQUARE where one of the 
BOT CAMERAS’ FEED used to be as the SIGNAL GOES OUT.  Then a 
11.
 SECOND BOT CAMERA goes black.  We see that Angler Fish 
suddenly dart away and then THAT CAMERA TOO GOES BLACK. 
INT. ANGEL TWO - CONTINUED
 Piloted by FRANCOIS Bernard and his brother, LUC.  They are 
in a hovering orbit, with Junjie’s Mule “Angel One” visible 
not too far off their starboard side.
 They watch as - one by one - THE BOTS vanish into blackness. 
FRANCOIS
 Mana, Angel Two.  We’ve lost visual 
on the Bots.  All of them.
 BACK IN THE DIVE CONTROL CENTER
 Zhang confers with Mac.  Fan and Dimitri pour over some data.  
Nothing dramatic has happened up here, but the discussion 
among the staff is enough to make some people wonder:
 INDIAN VIP
 (to Morris)
 Is everything okay?
 Mac catches wind of that question.  Adjusts his tie and 
screws on the charm.  
MAC
 Everything is fine.  The test went 
perfectly.  I’ve asked Dimitri to 
power down the Bots so we could re
position them.  Our placement was 
good, but you know Dr. Zhang, it 
has to be perfect, so... 
Morris, reading Mac, has already called for the Elevator.  
She jumps in-
MORRIS
 (to the VIPs)--So we just want to say thank you, 
again, for making the trip to be a 
part of history.  Before we take 
you back to Shanghai, we do still 
have one very important thing we 
have to do -- raid that gift shop 
so no one goes home empty handed.
 The VIPs step in the ELEVATOR, the door CLOSES, they’re GONE.  
MAC
 Thank God the dog and pony show is 
over because I haven’t cursed in 
(MORE)
12.
 MAC (CONT'D)
 twenty minutes and I’m starting to 
worry about what might come out of 
my mouth.  Talk to me, people.  
Mac approaches Dimitri, who is hovering over Fan, both 
watching the computer systems reboot.  As Mac arrives he 
“loosens” his tie.  Except Mac’s wearing a clip-on tie
 - so 
it comes right off.  Fan’s attention turns from the computer 
screen to Mac’s absurd accessory.
 FAN
 It’s like you just pulled a unicorn 
off your shirt.  I’d heard of clip
on ties, but thought they were an 
urban legend-- 
MAC
 You think my tie is the reason 
we’re staring at a wall of blank 
monitors!? 
FAN
 Honestly, I’m not prepared to rule 
it out.  
DIMITRI
 (has the real answer)
 The BOTS have been knocked off 
their moorings.  Suyin was right. 
It must have been a landslide.
 ZHANG
 Are you saying we have to put all 
the BOTS back in position?  
Dimitri nods.  That’s a lot of work.  Mac turns to Zhang.
 MAC
 Maybe we should bring everyone up, 
start fresh in the morning.
 DIMITRI
 Sure, the BOTS are only 100 million 
euros a-piece.  Let’s leave them 
unfastened at the bottom of the 
trench - what could go wrong?
 Mac doesn’t appreciate the sarcasm.  But Zhang agrees with 
Dimitri.  As does Fan.  As does Mac, when he thinks about it.
 MAC (MIC)
 Good news, gang.  You’re going to 
earn some overtime...
13.
 ZHANG crosses to HELLER at the MEDICAL MONITORING STATION.  
They can see the divers’ heart rates, body temperature, etc.
 ZHANG
 Dr. Heller, will it be safe for 
them to stay down there that long?
 HELLER
 They’re fine.  Vitals are normal. 
(tries to lighten things)
 Junjie’s so relaxed, he might 
actually be asleep.
 Zhang smiles.  He needed that.  He looks over at Meiying.
 ZHANG
 Come on, sweetie, I’ll take you 
back to your room.  Mommy’s going 
to be down there a while longer.
 INT. ANGEL ONE - CONTINUED
 Junjie puts his Mule into a descent.
 JUNJIE/ANGEL ONE 
Angel one.  Heading back down.  Try 
not to crash into me, Francois.  I 
saw that bottle of Merlot you 
smuggled on board.
 INT. ANGEL TWO - CONTINUED
 Francois puts his Mule into a descent.
 FRANCOIS/ANGEL TWO
 Angel One, I take offense to that.  
No Frenchman would risk a dive for 
a Merlot.  Now a good Bordeaux on 
the other hand...
 EXT. WIDE SHOT - TRENCH - CONTINUED
 We watch as the TWO MULES plunge into darkness.  All is quiet 
and peaceful UNTIL -- SOME FAST MOVING MASSIVE SHAPE
 glides across the FRAME and we...
 INT. DIVE CONTROL CENTER - A LITTLE LATER
 -- 
CUT TO:
 Visual and Data feeds from all four subs are BREAKING UP now.  
Pictures go FUZZY... Voices sound computer DISTORTED...  
14.
 MAC (MIC)
 Angels One and Two, status?
 INT. ANGEL TWO 
Francois and Luc’s POV as they close in on a Bot.  Their 
search and flood lights illuminating a cone of darkness.
 FRANCOIS
 Coming up on a Bot.  Looks like it 
was knocked over.  
MAC (RADIO)
 Angel 2, was it a landslide?
 MEANWHILE - ABOVE THEM - INT. FASTBACK ONE 
Suyin fights to steady her Abyss Glider against the current.
 SUYIN
 DJ, current’s picking up. I’m 
firing starboard anchor.  
She flips a switch and...
 EXT. FASTBACK ONE - SAME
 An ANCHOR shoots out of the right wing-top of Suyin’s Abyss 
Glider and lodges in the side of the vertical cliff face.
 Then WHOOSH -- another anchor goes by and burrows into the 
solid face -- revealing DJ’S Glider has done the same thing.
 BELOW -- we can see the lights of Angel One and Two.  Then 
SOMETHING PASSES OVER THEM - momentarily obscuring our view.
 INT. ANGEL ONE - CONTINUED
 JUNJIE approaches a Bot.  You can BARELY SEE ANYTHING around 
him.  The intense depth causes the HULL TO MOAN AND POP.
 JUNJIE
 Through 11,000 meters.  It’s pea 
soup down here guys.  Something 
really stirred the sediment up. 
FRANCOIS (RADIO)
 Guys, this BOT is completely caved in.  
A bead of sweat rolls down Junjie’s forehead, as his sub 
anxiously creeps forward inches at a time.  Finally, through 
the haze of sand, the BOT COMES INTO VIEW.
15.
 JUNJIE
 That’s impossible...
 JUNJIE'S POV OF THE BOT -- It’s completely torn apart
 .  
INT. DIVE CONTROL CENTER
 Heller notices Junjie and Carl’s Heart rates begin to RISE...
 JUNJIE (RADIO - STATIC)
 ....looks like a bomb...  We’re... 
through the wreckage.... Clues.
 Mac turns to Zhang.  He’s got a bad feeling about this.
 MAC
 Dr. Zhang, I suggest we get our 
people out of there, go back down 
with an unmanned sub...
 INT. ANGEL ONE
 Junjie carefully guides his sub over the debris field.  
WE/THEY can only see inches at a time.  Carl points to 
something that isn’t metallic grey in the wreckage.
 It’s a WHITE TRIANGULAR OBJECT, which is partially broken, 
that is now embedded in the side of the UNIS BOT.  
JUNJIE   
There’s something in the bot.
 INT. DIVE CONTROL CENTER
 Mac continues his plea.  
MAC
 When I hear talk of an explosion-
DIMITRI
 There is nothing explosive down 
there. 
MAC--I don’t think Junjie is making it 
up, do you?  Something happened.
 INT. ANGEL ONE
 The MYSTERIOUS OBJECT becomes more clear... There isn’t just 
ONE TRIANGLE.  There are four, five, six... 
JUNJIE
 Oh my God...
16.
 Junjie and Carl are transfixed by a row of GIANT TEETH
 . 
INT. DIVE CONTROL CENTER
 Heller sees the HEART RATES of Junjie and Carl jump. 
HELLER (MIC)
 Junjie, I’m seeing major spikes for 
you and Carl - are you okay?  
They get no immediate answer - so Mac makes a decision.
 MAC (MIC)
 This is Mana-One - code BUSTER. All 
vehicles commence ascent now.
 INT. FASTBACK ONE
 Suyin realizes the Mules can’t hear Mac.  She relays:
 SUYIN
 Angels one and two, code Buster.  
We’re getting out of here.
 INT. ANGEL ONE
 Carl and Junjie - transfixed by the sight of the teeth.
 CARL
 Yeah.  I think that’s a swell idea----In less than a tenth of a second, 
SOMETHING
 hits Angel One 
with the force of a 
FREIGHT TRAIN
 .  The sub IMPLODES, killing 
Junjie and Carl instantly!
 INT. DIVE CONTROL CENTER
 And sending flat lines to Heller’s readings.
 HELLER
 I’ve lost them!
 FAN
 (looking on tactical)
 So have I...
 Mac’s radio calls to Angel One play over:
 INT. ANGEL TWO - CONTINUED
 Francois and Luc are rising from the trench when suddenly Luc 
sees a SHADOW approaching and WHAM-
17.
 INT.  DIVE CONTROL CENTER--Contact with Francois and Luc is lost.  The DCC is in chaos.
 INT.  FASTBACK ONE - CONTINUED
 Suyin can hear Mac’s frantic radio calls for Angels One and 
Two.  She’s getting very worried now.
 SUYIN
 Angel One this is Fastback, over.  
Junjie, talk to me.  Angel Two...
 Then... PING - PING.  Suyin’s sonar begins to identify 
MULTIPLE TARGETS COMING UP AT HER FROM BELOW.
 DJ (RADIO)
 Suyin, I’ve got multiple targets,  
directly below and rising fast.
 SUYIN
 Angel One, Angel Two, come in...
 DJ (RADIO)
 Suyin, do you hear me?  We’ve got 
to get out of here.  Now!
 INT.  FASTBACK TWO - CONTINUED
 PING - PING - PING - as the targets get closer, the pitch of 
the PINGS increases and the volume gets louder.  DJ cuts away 
his sub’s anchor - but sees Suyin hasn’t done the same.
 DJ
 Cut away or you’ll be killed!
 SUYIN (RADIO)
 You want to run, run, but I’m not 
leaving them...
 DJ
 (to himself)
 Yes, you are...
 EXT. OCEAN - CONTINUED
 In an INCREDIBLE DISPLAY OF PILOTING SKILL, DJ uses the wings 
of his Abyss Glider to BREAK SUYIN’S ANCHOR LINE.  
INT. FASTBACK ONE - CONTINUED
 Suyin - furious - 
18.
 SUYIN 
DJ, you son of a----BAM!  BAM!  BAM!  Suyin doesn’t get to finish that thought 
because she’s hit by RISING DEBRIS FROM JUNJIE’S SUB.  
Instantly, her craft is damaged.  Leaks spring.  She begins 
to lose air pressure.  ALARMS sound everywhere.
 INT. FASTBACK TWO - CONTINUED
 DJ hasn’t fared much better.  He can see systems failing.  He 
flips dozens of switches from memory as he radios a report:
 DJ
 Mana-One, this is Fastback One in 
the blind.  Both subs have been 
damaged, pressure vessel failing, 
commencing emergency ascent.  
He opens a glass panel and FLIPS a switch which turns the 
ABYSS GLIDER into a craft as buoyant as an air balloon. 
INT. FASTBACK ONE - CONTINUED
 Through the cracking cockpit glass over her head, Suyin sees 
DJ’s Abyss Glider begin to ascend.  She reaches for the same 
panel he used.... And flips it.  
SHE/WE HEAR - a muffled explosion.  A compressed gas 
cannister has inflated her emergency ascent buoys.  Her sub 
rises like a missile.
 INT. DIVE CONTROL CENTER
 Heller barks orders as he runs for the emergency lift.
 HELLER
 Have the decompression chamber 
pressurized for 7,000 meters and 
get all hands to the starboard 
quarter for retrieval.
 QUICK CUTS BETWEEN INT. FASTBACK ONE / INT. FASTBACK TWO
 DJ and Suyin struggle to stay conscious and help guide their 
subs to the surface.  The pressure and rapid ascent threaten 
to rip their vehicles apart.  And the pain is excruciating.  
INT. MANA-ONE DECOMPRESSION TANK
 Heller leads a staff of med-techs prepping the decomp tank.

 EXT. UNDERNEATH THE MANA-ONE
 DIVERS drop into the sea below.  They will meet the subs and 
lock the hydraulic arms into position.  
INT. FASTBACK ONE
 We stay close on Suyin as she fades out of consciousness.  
Her cabin is a cacophony of system alarms and warning lights. 
POV SUYIN
 The pressure shift attacks Suyin’s hold on reality.  Her POV 
becomes increasingly surreal as she closes in on the Mana
One.  The ship lights reflect on her sub window, blinding and 
heavenly.  We are losing her.  Her only connection to the 
world those deafening warning bells.  She’s surfaced but 
doesn’t know it.  Masked faces come into frame, an alien 
intrusion into her fever dream.  
TO BLACK:
 IN BLACK - we HEAR tap tap tap... tap tap tap...
 INT. DECOMPRESSION CHAMBER - A LITTLE LATER
 Suyin AWAKES with a start.  She looks around.  DJ is with 
her.  And tap tap tap - Meiying is signalling to her on the 
glass window of the decompression chamber hatch.
 SUYIN
 Hi, sweetie!  
They can’t hear each other, so they communicate by touching 
hands on the glass.
 SUYIN
 (without turning to DJ, asks)
 Junjie and Carl?
 DJ
 No.  But Francois and Luc are okay.
 INT. DIVE CONTROL CENTER - SAME
 Dimitri and Fan are pouring over schematics of the MULE SUB 
as Mac talks with Francois...
 MAC (MIC)
 And you tried isolating Bus-B?
 INT. ANGEL TWO - STUCK ON THE BOTTOM - SAME
 Luc looks at Francois.  Nods, he tried it.
FRANCOIS
 20.
 Our engines are fried, Mac.  Air 
pressure’s good.  Hull integrity is 
good.  But I’m afraid you’re going 
to have to come get us.
 ZHANG (RADIO)
 Any guess as to what hit you?
 FRANCOIS
 Do they have freight trains down 
here?
 INT. ZHANG’S PRIVATE OFFICE - MANA ONE
 Zhang, Heller, and Mac discuss their options.
 ZHANG
 How much air do they have?
 HELLER
 24 hours.  That’s more than enough.
 MAC
 Dimitri needs five hours to repair 
the Abyss Gliders.  Suyin and DJ 
can’t leave decomp for six - so I’m 
setting the dive for 1700 hours.
 Off their nods...
 MAC
 Which gives us time to get a pilot 
for Angel 3.  The best rescue diver 
on the planet is in Lufeng... 
HELLER
 ..You can’t be serious... 
MAC
 ...We need him.
 All three of them know who Mac means.  
HELLER
 Mac, I appreciate your loyalty, but 
do I have to remind you what 
happened the last time he went this 
deep? 
MAC
 I don’t know what happened.  And 
neither do you.
21.
 HELLER
 He had a psychotic episode under 
pressure-
MAC--That was your explanation, 
doctor.  Not his. 
HELLER
 Well - the Navy agreed with me.
 MAC
 Because it gave them a scapegoat.  
It let them close the books on bad 
mission and move on.
 (to Zhang)
 Dr. Zhang, a rescue like this, even 
with the best equipment in the 
world, is risky.  If it’s me down 
there, if it’s my daughter going 
down there, there’s only one man on 
the planet I want for the job.
 EXT.  DINOSAUR VALLEY - LUFENG - DAY
 Wind whips across the arid ochre mesas of the Lufeng Quarry.  
We hear the sound of PICK-AXES.  Then the delicate sound OF 
BRUSH STROKES as A PhD CANDIDATE IN MARINE BIOLOGY carefully 
tries to separate what is fossil from what is Earth.
 JONAS TAYLOR (O.S.)
 You don’t have to be so delicate...
 The Candidate’s Professor - JONAS TAYLOR, 30s, USN-Retired, 
takes his student’s tools and demonstrates a quicker method.  
Quizzing the girl as he goes...
 JONAS
 Have you identified the fossil?
 The Candidate stares at him.  He’s her professor, he’s also 
rugged and gorgeous and tends to leave people tongue-tied.
 JONAS
 Carcharocles... 
PHD CANDIDATE
 ...Carcharocles Megaladon.
 JONAS
 Good, and have you measured it?
 PHD CANDIDATE
 Eight centimeters...
22.
 JONAS
 Which means... 
PHD CANDIDATE
 It was from a juvenile, 10-12 
meters in length.
 JONAS
 Very good.  But the fact that it is 
black, fully carbonized, also 
means...
 He swings his hand axe at it... Clank... Nothing happens.
 JONAS
 You couldn’t break it if you tried.
 He gives her a friendly wink, she laughs, and he walks off. 
WE WIDEN -- to see this is a permanent Archeological Dig 
funded by the DEEP SEA CENTER AT TIANJIN.
 INT. TRAILER - CONTINUED
 Jonas stares off into the magnificent vista, as A TEACHING 
ASSISTANT hands him some papers to look through.
 TEACHING ASSISTANT
 Looking forward to getting back to 
Tianjin, Professor?
 JONAS
 I do love these two weeks in the 
quarry, but a new semester means 
fresh minds to open to all the 
amazing realities of our world.
 TEACHING ASSISTANT
 You mean ‘possibilities’, right?
 JONAS
 65 million years ago, this whole 
region was underwater.  And those 
fossils out there were alive.  
Sure, the water has receded.  But 
what makes you think the ocean 
itself has changed?  
The conversation trails off because of the sound of an 
arriving helicopter.  
JONAS
 We expecting guests?
23.
 The TA shakes his head.  He goes to check a clip-board.  
Jonas sees Mac, Heller, and Zhang get out.
 TEACHING ASSISTANT
 There’s nothing on the schedule...
 The TA looks up - realizes he’s talking to an empty trailer.
 EXT. EXCAVATION SITE - CONTINUED
 Jonas gives Mac a big hug.
 MAC
 How are you, Captain?
 JONAS
 Better than you, Mac, judging by 
the looks of you.
 ZHANG
 Captain Taylor, I’m-
JONAS
 I know who you are Dr. Zhang.  It’s 
an honor and a privilege.
 Last, but not least, is a rather sheepish Heller.
 HELLER
 Hello, Jonas.
 JONAS 
Hey there, Tom.
 POW - Jonas punches Heller in the face.  Heller goes down.
 MAC
 (deadpan)
 That actually went better than I 
expected.
 INT. TRAILER - A LITTLE LATER
 Jonas looks through screen grabs taken from the video feeds 
off of Junjie’s sub and the UNIS BOTs.
 JONAS 
How long after the BOTs were 
activated did you lose them?
 MAC
 Maybe five minutes.
JONAS
 24.
 And where were you, exactly?
 Mac shows him on the chart.  Jonas gives Mac a look.
 JONAS
 You went back there?
 ZHANG
 It was my decision.  That part of 
the trench has never been explored, 
its combination of depth and 
expanse make it-
JONAS
 The last great unknown on Earth.  
Yeah, I’ve heard that before.  It’s 
why the Navy had the Chesapeake 
doing maneuvers down there.  It’s 
why they had to send me in to 
rescue her men when she was 
mysteriously disabled.  And it’s 
why this guy blamed me when 
everyone died!
 HELLER
 I didn’t blame you.  I simply said 
that your after-action report, 
claiming you had been attacked by 
something down there, was likely 
the result of hypoxic dementia-
JONAS
 After which I was court-martialed, 
black-balled from every diving 
operation in the world, and now 
receive a steady supply of hate 
mail from widows who think I’m the 
reason those men are gone.
 MAC
 Look, Jonas.  I’m not a past or 
future guy.  I’m present tense.  
I’ve got two crew members sitting 
down there-
JONAS
 And who are you going to send for 
their rescuers when they get taken 
out too?
 ZHANG
 Captain, I’ve read your account of 
what happened to you.  Before today, 
(MORE)
25.
 ZHANG (CONT'D)
 I wouldn’t have given credence to 
your theories.  But now...  Now, two 
of my friends are dead.  And my 
daughter is only alive by providence.  
I’m here, we’re here, because you 
give us the best chance of not adding 
any more friends to that list.  
Jonas looks out at the field of fossils.  We don’t see what 
he’s looking at, but we know he’s made up his mind.  
HELLER
 Think of it as a chance to prove me 
wrong.
 JONAS
 (looks at Heller a beat)
 Don’t you get it?  I don’t want you 
to be wrong.
 Jonas walks out.  They realize he’s heading for the 
helicopter.  That’s good news.
 INT. HELICOPTER - DAY
 All four of them are seated, the machine is about to lift 
off.  Heller stares at a SCREEN CAPTURE PHOTO in Mac’s hands.  
HELLER
 You really think there’s something 
down there that could do that?
 Meaning, the BOT - torn in half.  Mac looks OUT THE WINDOW.
 MAC
 As a matter of fact, I do...
 Heller turns, and as the chopper lifts off, we REVEAL THE DIG 
SITE IN FULL...  And there, in the ochre canyon walls, is a 
SET OF JAWS SO BIG that eight grad students - standing side 
by side - fit comfortably in its width.   We HOLD on it and-
EXT. MANA ONE - NIGHT
 WIPE TO:
 The helicopter has landed.  Mac and Jonas have split off from 
the other two.  They walk across the platform with purpose,  
Jonas’s attention drawn to the state-of-the-art subs.  He 
eyeballs them, impressed.  Very impressed. 
MAC
 We dive in one hour. 
26.
 JONAS
 Why wait that long?
 MAC
 For starters, your two dive mates 
are in decomp...
 MAC INDICATES THE DECOMPRESSION TANK IN THE DISTANCE where 
Meiying is sitting outside ‘talking’ with her mom.
 JONAS
 That’s comforting.
 Mac and Jonas then DESCEND a stair, unaware that MEIYING, 
having seen them, has decided to follow them
 .
 EXT. MANA ONE - CONTINUED
 Meiying watches from a distance as Mac and Jonas inspect 
SUYIN’S ABYSS GLIDER up on a hydraulic lift.  DIMITRI and FAN 
are replacing the last of the damaged parts.  Quick intros-
MAC
 Jonas Taylor - Dimitri Karmanov 
Linfan Chang.
 (asks Dimitri)
 So, what’s the verdict?
 DIMITRI
 (furrowed brow)
 Suyin took a direct hit from a 
large piece of debris.  The 
pressure lines were cut.  There was 
damage to the sensor array.  The 
entire Nav was smashed-
MAC--Stop.  Are you doing that thing 
where you tell me how bad it is, 
then tell me you managed to fix it, 
so you look like a hero?
 That hangs there a beat.
 DIMITRI
 No.  I’m telling you it’s fixed.
 (beat, deadpan)
 Whether that makes me a hero or not 
is for others to decide. 
As Jonas and Mac walk away...
 JONAS
 I like him.
27.
 INT. MANA ONE - CORRIDOR - CONTINUED
 Meiying follows Jonas and Mac as they run into:
 MORRIS
 Captain Taylor, I’m Presca Morris,  
one of the financial partners in 
Mana-One.  I was looking up your 
records, and, well, all I found 
were records.  Most dives below 
20,0000 feet, most rescues in the 
history of the Navy, the list went 
on and on... Needless to say, I’m 
very glad you’re with us.
 JONAS
 Thank you, ma’am.
 As they walk off...
 MAC
 See, I told you I said good things.
 INT.  SPARE LIVING QUARTERS - CONTINUED
 Mac shows Jonas the simple stateroom.  A bed, a bathroom...
 MAC
 Jumpsuit in the closet.  You know 
the drill.
 JONAS
 I do...
 (sees something)
 Although I’m not sure what to do 
with this...
 MEIYING is standing in the doorway.
 MAC
 Meiying, are you spying on us?
 This is Zhang’s grand-daughter.
 JONAS
 Hi, Meiying.  I’m Jonas.
 MEIYING
 The crazy one.
 Jonas looks at Mac.
 JONAS
 Well, I see my reputation precedes 
me.  Who said that?
28.
 MEIYING
 My mom, when grandpa told her you 
were coming.  DJ, Dr. Heller...
 MAC
 ...I’m out of here...
 JONAS
 Yeah, I bet you are...
 Mac EXITS, leaving Jonas and Meiying alone.  Jonas gets a 
kick out of the little girl’s moxie.
 JONAS
 I’m not crazy.  It’s just -- I’ve 
seen things no one else has.
 MEIYING
 That’s the definition of crazy.
 JONAS
 (laughs)
 You’re tough.
 MEIYING
 Titanium.
 JONAS
 Titanium?  Wow, I’ve never met a 
girl made of titanium.  I’ve dated 
a few made of ice but...
 Jonas goes to squeeze Meiying’s biceps, which she’s offering 
as proof of her strength.
 JONAS
 Those are some guns you’ve got-
SUYIN (ARRIVING)
 (in Mandarin)
 Meiying come here now.  
Meiying retreats to her mom’s side.  Suyin, liberated from 
Decomp, is there in the doorway with DJ.
 JONAS
 You must be Suyin.  And DJ-
SUYIN--Briefing starts in ten minutes.  
With that Suyin and Meiying are gone, leaving DJ to follow a 
beat later after a shrug.
INT. DIVE CONTROL CENTER - A FEW MINUTES LATER
 29.
 The ENTIRE TEAM are pouring over charts of the Marianas 
Trench.  There is a vast deep basin in the heart of it, 
labeled “SIREN’S VOID”.  Mac is marking a position.
 MAC
 From what Francois described, best 
guess is he’s along this ridge 
here, about 2,000 yards from...
 Mac taps a RED CIRCLE on the chart.
 MAC (CONT’D)
 ...This thermal vent.  Dimitri’s 
run the numbers, and with Angel 2’s 
fuel tanks emptied, she’s light 
enough for the three of you to tow 
to the surface-
JONAS
 Send me first.
 Off their looks.
 JONAS
 Send me, alone, in the Mule.  Let 
me see if I can do a hatch-to
hatch...
 SUYIN
 No...
 JONAS
 If the hatch is blocked, then the 
two of you can come down to tow...
 SUYIN
 Okay, first of all, your method 
will waste hours...
 JONAS
 But put less lives at risk...
 SUYIN
 Second, I notice you picked 
yourself to be the lone diver, in 
spite of...
 JONAS
 ...In spite of the time off, yes. I 
have the most experience...
30.
 SUYIN
 ...I was going to say, in spite of 
the fact that on your last rescue 
everyone else was killed.
 That hangs there a beat.
 JONAS
 They were killed because they 
didn’t listen to me.  And there’s 
not a day goes by that I don’t 
think about how they could have 
made it if they believed what I was 
telling them...
 SUYIN
 ...Are we sure we want him with 
us...
 JONAS
 ...But, no, they were convinced it 
had to be a landslide.
 Landslide
 .  The word hangs there.  Suddenly, all is quiet.
 JONAS
 I don’t blame them.  I thought that 
at first too.  I mean, what else 
could show up on the sonar like 
that? What else could tear open 
metal like it was tin?  You don’t 
think about the fact that this 
‘landslide’ isn’t triggering any 
readings on the seismograph.  You 
don’t say to yourself - this is the 
most accurate, lethal, guided 
landslide in the 4 billion year 
history of geology.  Because what 
else could it be, right?  
After a long silence.
 JONAS
 Let me go, alone-
ZHANG
 No one appreciates your expertise 
more than I do, but this is our 
operation, we’re doing it as 
planned.  Is that a problem?
 Jonas considers it - looks at Mac.
31.
 JONAS
 I sincerely hope not.
 DJ
 Says the Monster Hunter.
 JONAS 
You think I’m hunting whatever is 
down there? 
(beat)
 It’s hunting us
 .
 EXT. SUBMERSIBLE LOADING STATION - NIGHT
 Carbon fiber and titanium gleam under the Kleig lights.  
SUYIN AND DJ inspect their Abyss Gliders. JONAS stares at the 
open hatch of his Mule.  He seems HESITANT.
 MAC (ARRIVING)`
 The results of the popularity 
contest are in.  You didn’t win.
 JONAS
 (looking at Suyin and DJ)
 I don’t care if they like me.  Will 
they listen to me? 
MAC
 Zhang’s daughter is tough, but 
remember she just lost two friends-
JONAS
 Will - they  - listen?
 MAC
 (nods, yes)
 They’re the two best sub pilots on 
the planet that aren’t named you.  
They’ve got ice in their veins and 
years of experience...
 Mac’s voice trails off because he and Jonas are now 
distracted by THE SIGHT OF DJ, kneeling in front of Fastback 
2, holding a small bundle of BURNING SAGE towards the hatch.
 MAC
 Yeah.  Um.  That’s white sage.  
Something to do with the clearing 
of negative energies.
 (beat)
 You want me to ask him to stop?
32.
 JONAS
 (droll)
 I want you to ask him for more.
 Jonas notices Meiying, who is with Suyin, waving at him...
 JONAS
 At least somebody likes me.
 Jonas waves back.  
DIMITRI (PRE-LAP/RADIO)
 Fastbacks clear for drop.
 In ten, nine, eight...
 INT.  JONAS’S MULE SUB - “ANGEL THREE” - NIGHT
 CLOSE ON Jonas -- as his Mule is LOWERED into the water.  He 
can see the Abyss Gliders (Fastback 1 and 2), on either side 
of him, held in angled chutes on the sides of the station.  
Their launch will be dynamic.  Jonas’s is more traditional.
 DIMITRI (RADIO)
 Seven, six, five, four...
 The OCEAN swallows Angel Three. 
INT. FASTBACK 1 - SUYIN
 A deep breath from Suyin as she reaches for the drop handle-
DIMITRI (RADIO)
 Three, two, one... Release
 .--And pulls it.  The Abyss Glider PLUMMETS into the ocean, 
cutting through the surface like an Olympic diver. 
INT. FASTBACK 2 - DJ
 DJ’s Abyss Glider PIERCES the sea with tremendous momentum 
and a slight roll.  DJ tilts his control stick.  His ship 
responds instantly, stopping itself, and establishing a hover 
a few meters below the surface.
 INT. ANGEL 3 - JONAS
 Unlike DJ and Suyin, it’s taking Jonas a few moments to get 
positive control over his sub and establish it as stable.
 SUYIN (RADIO)
 You need a minute there, Jonas?  
DJ (RADIO)
 Yeah.  You look a little seasick.
33.
 Jonas settling in - remembering the feel of being at sea.
 JONAS
 Mock all you want.  You two have 
the Ferraris, I’m in the mule.
 INT. DCC - CONTINUED
 FAN has the dive up on TACTICAL DISPLAY.  HELLER has all 
their vitals on screen.  DIMITRI and ZHANG are at the 
planning table, and MAC (with Morris behind him) is at the 
center of it all.
 MAC (MIC)
 Rescue One, commence descent.
 INT. FASTBACK ONE - SUYIN
 Suyin pushes her control stick forward and smoothly 
accelerates away from the surface.
 SUYIN 
Francois, we’re on our way...
 EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT
 The three subs, in formation, DISAPPEAR into the depths.  
INT.  DCC - LATER
 DISSOLVE TO:
 Almost two hours have gone by on the MISSION CLOCK.  Tactical 
shows the THREE SUBS are at nearly 6,000 meters below the 
sea, and approaching a LAYER that’s marked “THERMOCLINE”.
 FAN (MIC)
 Rescue One, approaching 
Thermocline.
 MORRIS
 What’s the thermocline?
 ZHANG
 It’s a dense layer of cold water 
that separates the upper ocean from 
the deep sea.
 QUICK CUTS BETWEEN FASTBACKS ONE AND TWO
 DJ and Suyin move reflexively.  Flipping switches and 
tightening their harnesses.
34.
 SUYIN 
Heaters to full.  Autostabilizers 
to on.  Harness secure.
 Suyin BEGINS TO EXPERIENCE TURBULENCE.  She reads a gauge.
 SUYIN
 Entering thermocline.  Sea temp now 
39 and dropping.
 INT. ANGEL THREE - JONAS
 Jonas is getting bounced around harder.  But that’s not the 
problem.  The problem is it’s starting to FREEZE in here.
 JONAS
 Mana, I’m showing a fault in the 
heating system.  Can you confirm?
 SUYIN (RADIO)
 Need us to tell you where the ‘on’ 
switch is, Jonas?
 INT. DCC - CONTINUED
 Fan confirms what Jonas sees.
 FAN (MIC)
 Jonas, we see the fault.  Try re
cycling the system.
 INT. ANGEL THREE - JONAS
 Jonas exhales, we can see frost on his breath.  Re-cycle the 
system?  That’s going to require him pulling out a checklist.
 DJ (RADIO)
 Just follow my lead, man.
 JONAS
 DJ, I’m not in the mood-
INT. FASTBACK TWO - DJ
 DJ isn’t teasing him. 
DJ
 My temp gauge hasn’t gone below 48 
and my ride is smooth as glass.
 INT. DCC - CONTINUED
 Mac is about to tell Fan to check that but she already has.
35.
 FAN
 (turns to Mac)
 He’s right.  Looks like DJ has 
found some kind of warm water 
upcurrent through the thermocline.
 (looks at Zhang)
 Have you ever heard of that?
 ZHANG
 No.  The thermocline is a wall.
 MAC
 Yeah well, there’s a hole in this 
wall, and if you don’t mind, I’d 
like to send our team through it so 
Jonas doesn’t freeze to death.
 FAN (MIC)
 Jonas, good news.  You can put down 
the checklist...
 INT. ANGEL THREE - JONAS
 Jonas tosses the checklist aside.
 FAN (RADIO)
 Come to 270 and then shadow DJ, 
he’s found a smoother ride.  Suyin, 
suggest you do the same.
 INT. FASTBACK ONE - SUYIN
 Suyin corrects her course.
 SUYIN 
Nice job, DJ.
 DJ (RADIO)
 Totally all skill on my part.
 INT. ANGEL THREE - JONAS
 Jonas feels the ride smooth out, and sees his SEA TEMP GAUGE 
rise.  The frost inside his cabin begins to thaw.
 JONAS
 I’ve found the channel.  I’m going 
to power down and enjoy the ride...
 Jonas flips a bunch of switches, KILLING ALL OF HIS EXTERIOR 
LIGHTS, plunging him into darkness. 
36.
 INT. FASTBACK ONE - SUYIN
 Suyin is a few hundred meters above/behind Jonas.
 SUYIN
 Angel Three, did you just kill your 
lights?
 JONAS (RADIO)
 Affirmative.
 SUYIN
 You feel like telling us why?
 JONAS (RADIO)
 See for yourself.
 Suyin, annoyed, decides to go ahead.  She kills her lights, 
finds herself in darkness.  She’s about to get mad when...
 HER FASTBACK is suddenly illuminated by COLORFUL 
BIOLUMINESCENT LIGHTS
 from outside.  It’s dazzling.
 INT. FASTBACK TWO - DJ
 DJ, in near total darkness, is already enjoying the show.
 DJ
 Ok, I’m not gonna lie.  This is 
awesome.
 The warm water channel is filled with tiny plankton and algae 
that LIGHT UP when agitated, meaning DJ is leaving a trail of 
bioluminescent light in his wake...
 INT. ANGEL THREE - JONAS
 For a few moments, Jonas just sits there, marvelling...
 JONAS
 It’s good to be home.
 EXT. DEEP SEA - CONTINUED
 The three of them descend, like rainbow-tailed comets, 
through the inky blackness...
 INT. DCC - LATER
 DISSOLVE TO:
 TACTICAL now shows all three subs passing 10,000 meters.
37.
 FAN (MIC)
 Rescue 1, approaching bottom.
 QUICK CUTS BETWEEN FASTBACK ONE AND TWO 
As both SUYIN and DJ power back up...
 INT. ANGEL THREE - SAME
 Jonas is more reluctant to turn everything back on.
 JONAS
 Fastback one, suggest we keep power 
to minimal.  No need to tell the 
whole world we’re here.
 SUYIN (RADIO)
 Negative, Angel Three.  This is a 
rescue, we want all systems on.
 JONAS
 Look, I just think we want to keep 
a low profile-
FRANCOIS (RADIO)
 Did somebody say rescue?
 INT. ANGEL TWO - CONTINUED
 Francois and Luc can see the position and search lights of 
the three rescue subs in the distance.
 FRANCOIS (CONT’D)
 Cause that’s the word the of the 
day here at Chez Francois.  You’ve 
each won a free dinner!
 INT. FASTBACK ONE - SUYIN  
Suyin is thrilled to report.
 SUYIN
 Mana-One.  We’ve found them!
 INT. DCC - CONTINUED
 Morris and Zhang greatly relieved.  Dimitri satisfied with 
his work.  Fan squeezes his hand.
 MAC
 Let’s save the celebrating for when 
they’re back please.
38.
 INT. ANGEL THREE - JONAS
 Jonas watches as Suyin accelerates by him to join DJ in 
approaching the sub.
 SUYIN (RADIO)
 Jonas, we’ll secure our tow lines 
first, then you do the heavy 
lifting.
 INT. ANGEL TWO - CONTINUED
 Francois and Luc can see Fastbacks One and Two getting 
closer.  Everything is great until A LONG SHADOW passes 
between them and the rescue subs.
 FRANCOIS
 Guys... Did you see that?
 INT. ANGEL THREE - JONAS
 Jonas’s SONAR comes to life...  PING... PING...
 JONAS
 Target, bearing 120... 
INT. FASTBACK TWO - DJ
 DJ checks his sonar.  It’s PINGING.  His HEADS-UP display has 
put squares on multiple points in the darkness...
 DJ
 I’ve got it too, multiple bogeys...
 SUYIN (RADIO)
 Then let’s hurry this up.
 INT. FASTBACK ONE - SUYIN
 Suyin takes her sub down a little faster and THROWS ON HER 
FLOOD LIGHTS illuminating the dark...
 JONAS (RADIO)
 Fastback, that is a bad idea-
Suyin reaches the bottom.  Her engines KICK UP THE SAND -- 
SUYIN
 Dammit...-- creating an undersea FOG that, because of the lack of 
current, just hangs there, obscuring everything.
39.
 SUYIN
 I’ve lost all visibility.  Repeat, 
lost all visibility...
 She gets occasional glimpses of clear water in between thick 
patches of cloudy sand.  SOMETHING passes by in the darkness
 .
 SUYIN
 (stunned)
 There’s something down here.
 INT. FASTBACK TWO - DJ
 DJ gets a glimpse of SOMETHING too.
 DJ
 I see it!
 But it is gone as quickly as it was there.
 DJ
 Why aren’t we getting it on sonar?!
 JONAS (RADIO)
 The sand fog’s made the sonar 
useless...
 INT. DCC - CONTINUED
 As all three pilots are now talking over one another.
 DJ (RADIO)
 Mana-One, we are NOT alone down 
here, repeat, not alone...
 JONAS (RADIO)
 You both need to pull back...
 SUYIN (RADIO)
 Negative, I’m attaching my tow-line 
to Angel Two.  DJ, standby...
 INT. FASTBACK ONE - SUYIN
 Suyin centers ANGEL TWO in her sights and FIRES her tow-line. 
Whooosh - a thin, magnetic-tipped length of wire shoots off 
into the darkness towards ANGEL TWO but... THUNK... IT HITS 
SOMETHING ELSE FIRST and falls to the sea floor.
 SUYIN
 What the...?--WHAM!! SOMETHING MASSIVE hits Fastback One.  It’s a 
glancing blow but it sends it SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL.
40.
 INT. FASTBACK TWO - DJ
 DJ is in thick sand fog when he suddenly finds himself face 
to face with FASTBACK ONE as Suyin finally regains control.
 DJ
 Suyin, are you oka-
BAM, now it’s DJ’s turn to be hit by something.  He spins...
 INT. DCC - CONTINUED
 Heller watches as SUYIN AND DJ’S pulses soar into the 160s as 
both can be heard SHOUTING STATUS reports over the radio.
 DJ
 I’ve been hit.  I’m okay...!
 SUYIN
 Mana-One, we are totally defensive, 
unknown contacts...!
 JONAS’S PULSE is steady.  And that’s because...
 INT. ANGEL THREE - CONTINUED
 Jonas makes a choice.  He slams the throttle forward.
 JONAS
 Angel Two, forget about the tow.  
Prepare for hatch-to-hatch!
 EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT
 Angel Three plunges fearlessly through the zero visibility.  
EXT. ANGEL THREE - ANGEL TWO
 Jonas deftly rolls his sub on its side, aligning its hatch 
with Angel Two’s hatch.
 JONAS (RADIO)
 Standby for docking!
 The two hatches meet with a THUD that reverberates into the 
darkness at the speed of sound.  It travels out past the 
fastback subs, into the black, where SOMETHING REACTS to it.
 INT. FASTBACK ONE - SUYIN
 Ping.  Suyin looks down.  A clear target on passive sonar.
41.
 SUYIN (MIC)
 Angel Three.  Single target.  2000 
yards.  Bearing.  Right at you!
 INT. ANGEL THREE - CONTINUED
 Jonas powers up to create a seal between hatches.
 JONAS 
Guys, let’s go.  I’m not sure we’ve 
got a lot of time.
 INT. ANGEL TWO / ANGEL THREE
 Francois and Luc work fast on their end.  
INT. DCC - CONTINUED
 Where everyone can only listen.
 SUYIN (RADIO)
 Angel Three, 1200 yards... A 
thousand...!
 INT. ANGEL TWO / ANGEL THREE
 Francois unseals his upper hatch and opens it.  After some 
residual water falls out, he is safe to climb through to the 
hatch of the Angel Three.
 SUYIN (RADIO)
 Coming up on 800 yards, you need to 
get out of there!  
As Luc preps the ship for evac, HE SUDDENLY SEES SOMETHING 
out the sub window that stops him in his tracks... 
FRANCOIS
 Come on, Luc!  Come on!
 ....a vague bioluminescent trail behind some otherwise 
invisible beast that’s coming right at them.  
SUYIN (RADIO)
 600 yards... 400 yards!
 Luc knows there’s no time.  He closes his hatch and-
FRANCOIS
 NO!
42.
 INT. ANGEL TWO - NOW SEPARATE
 Luc BLOWS the lock, detaching violently from Angel Three.  
And not a moment too soon.  Because...
 ...BAM!  Angel Two is smashed into oblivion by something 70
feet long and moving at more than 50 miles per hour.
 INT. FASTBACK ONE - SUYIN
 Suyin feels the vibrations of the terrible collision.
 SUYIN
 Angel Three, come in?!  Angel 
Three...
 As she waits for a reply, PING... PING... Suyin’s sonar tells 
her the mysterious monster is now coming for her and DJ
 .
 INT. ANGEL THREE - JONAS AND FRANCOIS
 Sparks explode inside the main cabin as Jonas and Francois 
recover from the partial impact.  The only light comes 
intermittently from the flashing red alarms blaring. 
JONAS
 This is Angel Three, we lost Luc.  
You both need to power down now!
 INT.  FASTBACK TWO - DJ
 PING... PING....  DJ realizes they don’t have much time.
 JONAS (RADIO)
 It’s drawn to energy.  You need to 
go dark!
 SUYIN (RADIO)--But we’ll be sitting ducks!-
DJ
 That’s better than dead ducks!
 DJ’s turns off EVERYTHING that sends out a signal, including 
lights.  That leaves only the PINGING of his passive sonar, 
which gets faster as whatever is out there closes in.
 INT.  FASTBACK ONE - SUYIN
 Suyin now sits in the dark too.  As the PINGING becomes 
frantic, she stares out into the inky sea and takes her hands 
away from the controls.  She braces for impact as SWOOOOOSH!! 
SOMETHING MASSIVE HURTLES JUST PAST HER...
43.
 INT.  FASTBACK TWO - DJ
 DJ feels it go by too... Then, he exhales.  He’s alive.  For 
now.  But the PINGING of his sonar now reveals that:
 DJ
 It’s circling us.  
INT. DCC - CONTINUED
 Mac and his team, desperate to help.
 DIMITRI (MIC)
 Use your infrared, you should be 
able to see and not be seen.
 INT. FASTBACK ONE - SUYIN
 Suyin turns on the sub’s infrared lights and pulls down a 
visor... 
HER POV -- It’s similar to night vision, a world in black and 
green.  Suyin can see the distant outline of the trench wall, 
she can see DJ’s sub, and she can see A BLUR OF MOVEMENT 
which leaves in its wake a random trail of bioluminescence.
 SUYIN
 I don’t think seeing is going to 
help much.  Any other ideas, Mana?
 INT. FASTBACK TWO - DJ
 DJ, scared, has also gone to infrared.  The first thing he 
sees is the SHAPE of Suyin’s Abyss Glider.  So fish-like. 
DJ
 Here’s an idea.  Dimitri, the next 
time you design a sub, maybe don’t 
make it look like the catch of the 
day!
 Then DJ freezes...
 HIS INFRARED POV --  A GIANT SQUID, with a body twenty feet 
long and tentacles measuring out to more than a hundred, is 
now floating right in between him and Suyin.
 DJ
 Suyin...
 INT. FASTBACK ONE - SUYIN
 Suyin turns and sees the monster.  They seem totally helpless 
against the mighty Kraken, which is now advancing menacingly. 
44.--UNTIL -- WHAM -- THE GIANT SQUID IS TORN IN HALF in one 
violent attack by A MEGALADON
 .
 QUICK CUTS BETWEEN THE DCC AND ANGEL THREE
 As they hear screams and want to know...
 MAC (MIC)
 Is everybody okay?
 INT. FASTBACK ONE - SUYIN
 Suyin has ripped off the goggles.
 SUYIN
 It’s a shark.  
INT. ANGEL THREE - CONTINUED
 Jonas hears exactly what he was hoping he wouldn’t hear...
 SUYIN (RADIO)
 Huge.  60 feet.  Maybe more.
 JONAS
 (to himself)
 Carcharocles Megaladon.
 INT. DCC - CONTINUED
 Everyone takes a beat to process the news.
 SUYIN (RADIO)
 It ripped a giant squid right in 
half. 
INT. FASTBACK TWO - DJ
 DJ was even closer to the mauling.  He’s actually drifting 
through what’s left of the squid.
 DJ
 Yeah.  And I say we get out of here 
before it get gets hungry again!
 DJ starts to power up when-
JONAS (RADIO)
 No, DJ.  Don’t.  If you power on, 
it will come for you.  You have to 
surface without using your engines.
45.
 INT. FASTBACK ONE - SUYIN
 Suyin shakes her head to no one.
 SUYIN
 We’re too deep, Jonas.  We need our 
engines to climb from down here.  
We’re at zero ballast.
 As if to emphasize the danger, SOMETHING speeds by in the 
darkness, ROCKING THE TWO FASTBACKS IN ITS WAKE.
 INT. ANGEL THREE - JONAS AND FRANCOIS
 Jonas looks at Francois - is she right?  Francois nods, yes.
 FRANCOIS
 Mules have standard ballast tanks, 
but not the fastbacks.  This deep, 
they have to power up-
JONAS
 If they power up - they’re fish 
food!
 FRANCOIS 
They’re already fish food!  We need 
to get them off the menu!
 Jonas gets an IDEA.  He keys the mic.
 JONAS (MIC)
 What about the thermal vent
 ?
 INT. FASTBACK ONE - SUYIN
 Suyin understands the plan the minute she hears it...
 JONAS (RADIO)
 That upcurrent of warm water we 
rode down.  That could carry you up 
a few thousand meters without you 
needing power.
 INT. FASTBACK TWO - DJ
 DJ wants to be hopeful but...
 DJ
 I don’t mean to be a downer but 
that vent is a mile from here and I 
don’t think paddling is an option.
46.
 INT. ANGEL THREE - JONAS AND FRANCOIS
 Jonas is one step ahead of them.  He turns to Francois.
 JONAS
 Does this thing have flares?
 FRANCOIS
 Why don’t I like that question?
 INT. DCC - CONTINUED
 Everyone, desperate for ideas, when they hear Jonas’ plan:
 JONAS (RADIO)
 Fastbacks one and two, when I tell 
you to, I want you to both power up 
and go flank speed for the vents.
 Looks are exchanged.  What’s Jonas doing?
 JONAS (RADIO)
 Mana, can you give them a bearing 
to that vent please?
 FAN (MIC)
 0-5-0.
 QUICK CUTS BETWEEN THE FASTBACKS - DJ AND SUYIN
 DJ and Suyin are dialing in 050 but-
SUYIN
 Jonas, what about the shark?
 INT. ANGEL THREE - JONAS AND FRANCOIS
 Jonas trims the last of the ballast trim tabs.   He and 
Francois are ready to do whatever it is they’re about to do.  
JONAS 
It’ll be pre-occupied.  With us.
 FRANCOIS
 (to Jonas, droll)
 I just want to say this has 
officially stopped feeling like a 
rescue.
 Jonas smiles.  Francois nods back.  And...
 JONAS
 NOW!
47.
 INT. FASTBACK ONE - SUYIN
 Suyin can suddenly see a bloom of white as -- FWOOMP! --  The 
BRIGHT LIGHTS of Angel Three shatter the darkness like an 
undersea North Star.  Suyin is jostled by the WAKE of 
SOMETHING MASSIVE OVERHEAD. It completely eclipses the Angel 
Three, taking seconds, that feel like minutes, to pass, until 
even in the darkness, she makes out the unmistakable shape of 
an ENORMOUS TAIL FIN snapping right in front of her.  
SUYIN
 Oh my God.
 The invisible beast heads for Angel Three.
 SUYIN
 Angel Three, it’s coming to you!
 JONAS (RADIO)
 Head for the vent!  Go!
 QUICK CUTS BETWEEN THE FASTBACKS - DJ AND SUYIN
 DJ and SUYIN both power up and race for the vent.
 SUYIN
 Range to vent... 1500 meters.
 INT. ANGEL THREE - JONAS AND FRANCOIS
 Francois and Jonas can see the Two Abyss Gliders race for the 
vent as the bioluminescent storm that is the MEG heads 
straight for the Mule.
 JONAS
 That’s it.  Come on...
 INT. FASTBACK TWO - DJ
 DJ peering into the darkness with his Infrared Visor.  It’s 
like flying at night... We can tell they’re moving very fast.
 SUYIN (RADIO)
 1000 meters!
 INT. DCC - CONTINUED
 Everyone is on the edge of their seat... 
FAN
 You think this will work?
 Mac indicates Jonas’s pulse.  Which is steady.
48.
 MAC
 He does.  So I do too.
 INT. ANGEL THREE - JONAS AND FRANCOIS
 Francois is getting nervous, but Jonas remains calm...
 SUYIN (RADIO)
 600 meters!
 INT. FASTBACK ONE - SUYIN
 Using Infrared, Suyin can see THE THERMAL VENT AHEAD...
 SUYIN
 Vent in sight!  
INT. FASTBACK TWO - DJ
 DJ sees it too.  Then suddenly a TENTACLE ATTACKS HIS SUB...
 DJ
 AHHH...
 For a moment, DJ thinks he’s squid food.  He is ensnared in 
the angry embrace of the massive cephalopod.  But then he 
realizes these are just PIECES of what’s left of that squid.
 SUYIN (RADIO)
 DJ?
 DJ
 I’m good.  Sub’s gonna need a wash 
though.
 SUYIN (RADIO)
 Entering vent.  Controls on!
 EXT.  THERMAL VENT - SEA FLOOR - NIGHT
 We watch as first Suyin and then DJ enter the plume of 
violent water that rockets upwards...
 Careful eyes will see that the VENT ITSELF has been broken 
open by the REMAINS OF A CRASHED UNIS BOT.
 QUICK CUTS BETWEEN THE FASTBACKS - DJ AND SUYIN
 Fight to keep their ships stabilized...
 SUYIN
 Keep the bubble level and watch 
your hull temp.
49.
 DJ looks out the turbulent water, at the lights of Angel 
Three, and the black mass of the MEG hurtling towards it.
 DJ
 Everything I said about that guy.  
I’m taking it back right now.
 INT. ANGEL THREE - JONAS AND FRANCOIS
 Jonas can almost feel the beast upon them now.
 JONAS
 Standby... Standby... NOW!
 Jonas BLOWS all the BALLAST TANKS, and Francois hits the 
RESCUE FLARE switch.
 EXT. ANGEL THREE - CONTINUED
 The suddenly rising sub drops a FLARE, which spreads like a 
comet tail behind them.  As it does, Jonas kills the sub 
lights, so all focus is on the brilliant burning star.
 It drops through the inky depths.  Illuminating a wall filled 
with brightly colored algae, coral, alien creatures, until...
 WHOOSH, the massive beast snatches the flare, its enormous 
jaws illuminated for the first time.  The creature swims 
through its target, colliding violently with the undersea 
mountain range like a fiery wrecking ball.  The sea wall that 
once provided shelter for Francois, now reduced to rubble.  
INT. DCC - CONTINUED
 On TACTICAL:  They can see Angel Three rising, and...
 FAN
 Fastbacks One and Two are rising.  
They’re going to make it...
 ZHANG
 He did it...  He did it...
 Joy begins to ripple through the DCC, and it increases ten 
fold when they hear Jonas’ deadpan voice over the coms:
 JONAS (RADIO)
 Mana, this is Angel Three.  We’ve 
blown our ballast and are rising, 
power off.  We’ve lost our 
directional control so someone’s 
going to have to come meet us.
50.
 MAC (MIC)
 (laughing)
 That can be arranged-
But suddenly the good mood SOURS as -- PING... PING...
 INT. ANGEL THREE - JONAS AND FRANCOIS
 The PINGS are here too.  The MEG is coming for them. 
FRANCOIS
 But all the power’s off...
 JONAS
 I guess she learned that trick.  
Jonas begins to power the sub back on.
 JONAS
 We have to make flank speed for the 
thermocline.  It can’t follow us 
through that!  Francois, you ever 
been shot out of a cannon?  
FRANCOIS
 Right now, that actually sounds 
like a pretty good idea.
 Jonas shoves the throttle forward.  They rise like a missile.
 INT. DCC - CONTINUED
 The Sonar images tell the story.  Angel Three is rising... 
The Meg below closing in fast... And the THERMOCLINE looms.  
MAC
 At what water temperature will that 
thing have to turn back?
 FAN
 I don’t know.  Megalodons are 
supposed to be extinct.
 MAC
 Best guess then!
 ZHANG
 Fifty degrees.  
ANGEL THREE’S TEMP gauge - now at 58, ticks down to 57...
 INT. ANGEL THREE
 Francois watches through the back window.  So far, no Meg.
51.
 JONAS
 Approaching Thermocline.  You 
better grab on to something.
 WHAM!  The sub is SLAMMED by turbulence.  Bad turbulence. 
JONAS
 If I don’t slow down we might break 
apart!
 But now Francois can see THE MEGALADON - it’s closing fast.
 FRANCOIS
 That’s a negative on slowing down!
 INT. DCC - CONTINUED
 The good news is the temp is dropping... 54... 53... 52...
 INT. ANGEL THREE - CONTINUED
 The bad news is the beast has nearly reached them.  And, to 
make matters worse, all kinds of system alarms are firing as 
BOOM! BOOM!  They continue to get hammered by turbulence. 
JONAS
 We’re losing the engines!
 EXT. ANGEL THREE
 From outside the sub, we see the terrifying reality of just 
how close the Meg now is to the sub. 
INT. ANGEL THREE
 Francois’ chilling POV of the Meg, only seconds away.  Alarms 
blaring, the sub rocking, and the excruciating ascent...
 FRANCOIS
 AAAAAHHHH!!!!
 The MEG is about to reach them when SUDDENLY it turns back
 INT. DCC - CONTINUED
 !
 As we see the temperature gauge on Angel Three is now at 
50... 49...  And they all see that the MEG has turned around.
 MAC
 THEY MADE IT!  THEY MADE IT!
52.
 INT. ANGEL THREE - CONTINUED
 Jonas throttles back what’s left of the engines, the sub 
literally falling to pieces around him and Francois.
 JONAS
 Angel Three, above the Thermocline.  
Request permission to never go back 
down there again.
 MAC (RADIO)
 Permission granted!  Great job!
 Jonas and Francois share a very satisfied smile.
 FRANCOIS
 Nice to meet you by the way.
 EXT. FASTBACKS ONE AND TWO - CONTINUED
 The Abyss Gliders head for the surface.  As they speed off, 
we notice THE BLOODY TRAIL OF SQUID DJ’s sub is leaving 
behind... A trail that goes down... And down... And 
eventually...
 Into that warm water channel through the thermocline
 .
 EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - DAY
 ANGEL THREE bursts through the surface.  Jonas pops the 
hatch, climbs up and sees... NOTHING BUT OCEAN.
 JONAS
 So much for a welcoming committee.
 BLARE!  Comes the sound of a SHIP’S HORN as Jonas and 
Francois turn around to see ZHANG’S RESEARCH VESSEL - THE 
MAZU -- a thousand yards away.  And closing.
 JONAS
 Now that’s more like it.
 The SHIP’S HORN sounds again as we...
 CUT TO:
 EXT. A PRIVATE BAY - HAINAN ISLAND - THAT AFTERNOON
 Peace and quiet in one of Hainan’s most tranquil bays.
 The MAZU is anchored a few hundred yards off shore from THE 
NEW 5-STAR “MANA RESORT AND SPA
 ”.   The place is a few months 
from opening, but Morris’s crown jewel is fully built, with a 
skeleton staff is putting it through its paces.
53.
 INT. BEACH BUNGALOW GUEST ROOM - SHOWER - DAY
 Jonas enjoys a hot shower.  He’s cleaning up, and he’s trying 
to psychologically decompress from what’s just happened. He 
TURNS OFF the water and just stands there, breathing.
 EXT/INT.  BEACH BUNGALOW - CONTINUED
 A knock and Jonas’s unlocked door swings open.  SUYIN and 
MEIYING are there.  Meiying holding something in her hands.
 SUYIN
 Jonas?  Jonas?
 JONAS - having not heard them - steps out from his bathroom.  
Luckily, he’s in a towel.
 SUYIN AND JONAS
 Oh, excuse me... Sorry, I didn’t 
know...
 Meiying BURSTS OUT laughing.  And, as Jonas retreats to 
quickly pull on some clothes out of their line of sight, he 
begins to LAUGH too - because Meiying’s glee is infectious.
 JONAS
 (calls)
 She kills me, you know that?
 SUYIN
 (calls back)
 Tell me about it.  Saying no to her 
is almost impossible.  
Jonas returns, dressed and smiling.  Is this the first time 
Suyin has allowed herself to realize he’s handsome?  She’s 
suddenly very aware.  Luckily, her daughter to the rescue.
 MEIYING
 This is for you...
 Meiying hands him the somewhat crudely wrapped blob. It’s a 
DOLPHIN CHARM made of...
 JONAS
 Titanium.
 SUYIN
 The dolphin is the symbol of the 
Zhang family.  They’re also known 
to save people... from sharks.
 Meiying reveals that she wears a matching, smaller, version 
of the charm around her neck.   Jonas is very touched.
54.
 JONAS
 Thank you.
 SUYIN
 No, thank you.
 Meiying begins to tug on her mom, wants her to ask Jonas 
something, but Suyin has her own thought to finish first.
 SUYIN
 I was hard on you.  I didn’t treat 
you with the respect you deserved-
JONAS
 Forget about it-
SUYIN
 You saved our lives
 .  
Her sincerity makes him uncomfortable.  The intimacy of it.  
He shrugs it off but-
SUYIN
 Jonas.  Thank you.
 He nods.  You’re welcome.  Now, Meiying’s tugging reaches a 
fever pitch.  
JONAS
 Whatever it is, she’s not giving up.
 Suyin stops her daughter with a look.  Then...
 SUYIN
 Meiying wants me to ask you to join 
us for tea.  It’s another family 
tradition.  We share tea every time 
I’m back from a dive.
 MEIYING
 Only she missed it last time 
because she was in that stupid 
Decompression Tank.
 Jonas laughs at Meiying yet again.  But then he sees 
something through the doorway behind them.  It’s MAC and 
ZHANG walking a main building of the resort.
 JONAS
 I’d like to, but actually I have to 
talk to Mac about getting back to 
the mainland.
 Those words sting Suyin in a way she hadn’t expected.
55.
 SUYIN
 You’re leaving?  Right.  Of course.
 JONAS
 Now that everyone’s safe... I 
expect your father has a full plate 
without me to worry about.
 Suyin hides her disappointment.  Meiying doesn’t.
 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - RESORT - DAY
 A room with a view of the Pacific.  Right now it hosts an 
INTENSE DISCUSSION between Zhang, Morris, Heller, and Mac.
 MORRIS
 ...I’m not saying what happened 
wasn’t a tragedy, I just want to 
set that aside long enough to talk 
about what we found down there and 
what it means for the future.  
Because the choices we make between 
now and when you announce what 
happened could mean billions of 
dollars of added value.
 REVEAL - JONAS, outside, listening and thinking that-
EXT/INT. THE RESORT’S OPEN-AIR RESTAURANT - DAY
 Jonas finds Suyin and Meiying have set up tea at a table 
along the water’s edge. 
JONAS--On second thought, tea sounds 
great.
 Meiying claps.
 MEIYING
 Okay, sit here...  And do exactly 
as I say...
 JONAS
 (laughing, to Suyin)
 Apple doesn’t fall from the tree.
 Suyin blushes.
 BACK TO -- INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - RESORT - SUNSET
 A PICTORIAL of the ocean is unfurled.  It depicts the sea 
seen from the side, so is all about the VARIOUS DEPTHS.
56.
 ZHANG
 In general, the deeper you go, the 
further you get from the sun, the 
colder the ocean gets.  
MORRIS
 But where we dove today, at the 
very bottom, that water was warm.
 Zhang indicates ‘Siren’s Void’ - the vast basin of the 
Marianas Trench - an area more than 1,000 miles long.
 ZHANG
 Yes, a portion of the deepest ocean 
is heated by volcanic vents.  In 
these areas, as you get away from 
the heat source, so in this case as 
you rise, the water gets colder. 
The CHART makes it clear.  The water goes from warm at the 
bottom... gets cold as it rises away from the heat source... 
ZHANG
 The coldest water is always here in 
the thermocline.  This water is too 
cold to support any life.
 HELLER
 So whatever lives above, stays 
above.  And whatever lives below, 
stays below.
 ZHANG
 Given that we’ve never explored 
Siren’s Void, and given we’ve 
encountered at least one species, 
the Megaladon, heretofore thought 
extinct, I think the odds are there 
is an entire ecosystem down there 
that has remained untouched for 
millions of years.
 MORRIS
 (thrilled)
 Meaning we’re sitting on top of our 
very own Jurassic sea!
 INTERCUT -- THE RESORT’S OPEN-AIR RESTAURANT - SUNSET
 Meiying is showing Jonas the proper way to hold his tea cup, 
and Jonas is purposely getting it wrong to make her laugh.
 MEIYING
 He’s funny!
57.
 JONAS
 Yeah.  Funny looking.
 SUYIN
 Do you have children, Jonas?
 JONAS
 No.  When I was in the Navy, my 
wife and I kept putting it off... 
Then after we got divorced, I 
focused all my energy on...
 SUYIN
 Proving you weren’t crazy.
 MEIYING 
See, I told you she said you were 
crazy!
 That gets more laughs.  But then, as kids often do, Meiying 
suddenly realizes something and gets sad.
 MEIYING
 Wait.  Does that mean you don’t 
have a family?
 Jonas shakes his head, he doesn’t. 
FAN
 Got room for us?
 FAN arrives, with DIMITRI and DJ.  FRANCOIS is close behind.
 SUYIN
 The more the merrier.  Dimitri, 
since when do you drink tea?
 DIMITRI
 (nods to Fan)
 Since she makes me.
 That gets a good LAUGH.  Dimitri frowns.
 DIMITRI
 I wasn’t joking.
 That gets a BIGGER LAUGH.
 BACK TO -- INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - RESORT - SUNSET
 Where Morris is acting like they’ve just struck gold.
58.
 MORRIS
 Why am I the only one excited here? 
I’m no Marine Biologist, but even I 
remember the prehistoric oceans 
were filled will all sorts of 
amazing creatures.
 MAC
 Including one that just killed 
three of our people.
 MORRIS
 Again, I’m not discounting that...
 MAC
 That’s exactly what you’re doing...
 ZHANG
 Speculation is dangerous, Ms. 
Morris.  Only one thing is clear: 
we’ve found something very special, 
so we must proceed with caution. 
I’m afraid our plans to 
commercialize the Mana-One must be 
put on indefinite hold.
 MORRIS
 You can’t be serious...
 ZHANG
 The platform is located directly 
above this new world...
 MORRIS
 Which means we should double its 
size.  Then build a second one-
ZHANG
 This isn’t about attracting 
visitors.  It’s about making sure 
we protect the ecosystem.
 MORRIS
 If those things have been down 
there for 200 million years, I 
think their ecosystem can handle it
ZHANG
 I’m talking about our Ecosystem
 . 
(it hangs there a beat)
 The world we live in, a world whose 
entire balance of life would shift 
violently if even one pre-historic 
creature found its way up here.
59.
 INTERCUT -- THE RESORT’S OPEN-AIR RESTAURANT - SUNSET
 Where everyone is laughing now - relieved - letting go of 
some of the tension.  DJ raises his tea.
 DJ
 I’d like to propose a toast.  To 
Jonas.
 ALL
 To Jonas.
 Wait...
 JONAS
 (raises his)
 To Junjie, Carl, and Luc.
 If Jonas wasn’t a full-member of the team, then that gesture 
puts him over the top.  It’s met with nods and teary eyes.
 They drink, and then after they put their cups down all eyes 
turn to Francois. 
FAN
 So, Francois.  You got anything 
stronger than tea in your bungalow?
 FRANCOIS
 Why is it the Frenchman who always 
has to have the wine?
 (beat, a grin)
 I’ll be right back...
 Suyin and Jonas exchange a smile.  A smile that lingers.  A 
smile that keeps them focusing on each other even as we BEGIN 
TO HEAR the sound of a skiff’s engine racing into the bay.
 MEIYING
 There’s something out there...
 BACK TO -- INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - RESORT - SUNSET
 Morris looks at Zhang and the rest.
 MORRIS
 Dr. Zhang, you are a brilliant man.  
But if you think you can control 
what’s about to happen, you are, 
forgive me, very naive.  Before 
today, your platform was a 
specialty attraction.  But when the 
world hears what you found, it is 
going to be the most desired 
destination on Earth.  Every child 
(MORE)
60.
 MORRIS (CONT'D)
 on the planet will want to come 
here.  Every parent will make it a 
priority.  This resort, and every 
resort within 500 miles will devote 
themselves to what’s down there.  
Whether we like that or not-
Morris stops as suddenly the door is thrown open.  SUYIN, 
breathless from running, is there. 
SUYIN
 Dr. Heller!
 INT. RESORT’S BEACH - SUNSET/NIGHT
 Suyin and Heller race down to the water’s edge - (Mac, Zhang, 
and Morris close behind).  They find the rest of the team has 
encircled a fishing boat’s skiff, whose PILOT has driven it 
right up on the sand.  Then they see why:
 A SECOND MAN - lying unconscious and bleeding on the sand.
 HELLER
 (quickly goes to work)
 He’s in shock and suffering from 
severe hypothermia.  We need to get 
him to a hospital, right away--.
 FAN
 We called for an ambulance.
 HELLER
 Good, in the meantime, you can help 
me make sure he doesn’t lose any 
more blood.
 As Fan joins Heller in bandaging the seemingly endless number 
cuts on the man’s body, Mac asks the big question.
 MAC
 What happened?
 The Skiff’s Pilot answers in Mandarin. 
SUYIN (TRANSLATING)
 His ship was fishing when they 
heard a crash.  They turned and saw 
their sister ship had been smashed.  
Not an explosion, just smashed.  By 
the time they got over to the 
wreckage, this man was the only one 
in the water.  The others had 
vanished.  
61.
 The AMBULANCE has arrived.  PARAMEDICS come racing over with 
a stretcher.  Heller supervises as they take the patient to 
the ambulance...
 SKIFF’S PILOT
 (in broken English)
 Sea Monster.  He said - a Sea 
Monster attacked his ship.
 As THE ENTIRE TEAM exchanges glances we...
 EXT. A PRIVATE BAY - HAINAN ISLAND - NIGHT
 CUT TO:
 The Mazu’s anchor clears the surface, and the boat pivots 
until it is pointed out sea.  Then its mighty engines roar to 
life - and the Mazu heads out into the darkness.
 EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT
 Even with DJ and Suyin’s Abyss Gliders in tow, the Mazu can 
go as fast as 30 knots, its bow piercing the dark waters...
 EXT. MAZU - NIGHT
 Jonas is up near the bow rail, looking out into night, 
wondering...  Shaking his head as Mac looks on.
 JONAS
 If that thing followed us... If 
it’s up here somehow...
 MAC
 If being the key word.
 JONAS
 He called it a sea monster, Mac.  
All his life he’s worked the ocean, 
and he called it a sea monster...
 As if on cue the Mazu’s engines grow quiet and the ship 
DECELERATES...  Now we see why... Because they are drifting 
through floating wooden debris...  A whole field of it.
 JONAS
 (droll)
 You think a great white did this?
 MAC
 I think we’re about to find out.
 JONAS
 How?
62.
 Off Mac’s look...
 A SERIES OF QUICK INTERCUT SHOTS
 :
 INT. DIVE PREP ROOM - THE MAZU
 Close on FAN pulling on a wet suit.  DIMITRI zips her up.
 INT. THE BRIDGE - THE MAZU
 Jonas looking at Zhang and Morris.  He’s backed by DJ and 
Francois.  Suyin somewhere in the middle.
 JONAS
 Tell me this is a joke...
 INT. DIVE PREP ROOM - THE MAZU
 FAN, now fully suited up, CHECKS THE ACTION on a CARBON FIBER 
SPEAR GUN that is as light-weight as it is bad-ass looking.
 INT. THE BRIDGE - THE MAZU
 Jonas, continuing his rant.
 JONAS (CONT’D)
 ...Tell me we’re not seriously 
considering doing this...
 EXT. DIVE PREP ROOM - THE MAZU
 DIMITRI is filling SPEAR-TIPS (rounds for the Spear Gun) with 
liquid etorphine from glass medical bottles.
 DIMITRI
 An elephant is knocked out with 10 
cc’s  - so 100?
 FAN
 (not messing around)
 Use the whole damn bottle.
 INT. THE BRIDGE - THE MAZU
 Jonas shakes his head.
 JONAS (CONT’D)
 ...Because unless I missed 
something, this is insane.
 All eyes turn to Zhang.  Zhang looks at Fan and Dimitri.
FAN
 63.
 (disagrees forcefully)
 If the Meg followed DJ’s trail up 
through the thermocline, then we 
can’t let it get away.  We know it 
likes electromagnetic energy - that 
means Dimitri’s cage will draw it 
in like a moth to flame...
 JONAS
 ...Did you just compare that thing 
to a moth?  This is madness...
 MORRIS
 ...Actually madness, if I 
understand Dr. Zhang correctly, 
would be to let this creature roam 
off towards the fishing fleet.  
Those boats wouldn’t stand a 
chance.
 JONAS
 (glares at Morris)
 A captured Meg would make for great 
advertising, is that it?
 Zhang has heard enough.
 ZHANG
 We can’t avoid the truth, no matter 
how unpleasant.  If there is a 
Megaladon here, if we leave it free  
to feed and mate, then we would be 
responsible for the worst 
ecological disaster in history.  
We, who have given our lives to 
protect these oceans.
 (he looks at Dimitri)
 Are you sure your cage will hold?
 DIMITRI
 Math never lies.  The Megaladon 
could be the size of this ship, the 
cage will not break.
 FAN
 I’ll bet my life on it.
 She takes Dimitri’s hand.  Squeezes it.
64.
 EXT. MAZU - AFT-DECK
 There are TWO KEY FEATURES to the back of the MAZU:  One is a 
small HELIPAD.  The other is a PAIR OF MASSIVE RIGGING 
CRANES.  And it is from one of those crane’s that----DIMITRI’S DIVE CYLINDER is now suspended.
 The DIVE CYLINDER is a wonder.  A ten foot-tall tube, made of 
SELEXIS, a clear material, plastic in appearance, that is THE 
STRONGEST MAN-MADE MATERIAL in HISTORY.
 The CYLINDER has no corners, no weak points, and is large 
enough to hold several divers, though only FAN will be going 
down in it this time.
 OPENINGS cut in the center and the top of the structure are 
too small for a shark to get through, but large enough for 
FAN to use as murder holes for her SPEAR GUN.
 INT. DIVE CYLINDER - CONTINUED
 Mac operates the crane, lowers the DIVE CYLINDER into the 
water, stopping when it is half submerged to allow FAN, fully
suited up, to climb inside.
 Dimitri leans over the top, hands Fan her spear gun.  Fan 
cocks it with confidence.  Dimitri stares at her.
 DIMITRI
 Is it weird that I’m a little 
turned on?
 FAN
 By the sight of your girlfriend 
holding a high-velocity spear gun?  
Yes, it’s a little weird.
 DIMITRI
 (smiles)
 You’ve never used the word 
girlfriend before.
 FAN
 Please put me in the water.
 Dimitri smiles, shuts the top, and nods to Mac...
 EXT. MAZU - AFT-DECK - CONTINUED
 Mac pulls a lever and the Dive Cylinder sinks into the sea.   
Water floods the interior through the openings in the center 
and top of the chamber.   Among those watching the ‘launch’ 
is JONAS.  He shakes his head, worried.
65.
 DIMITRI
 Jonas, I’m telling you.  The cage 
will not break.
 We begin to hear the sound of an APPROACHING HELICOPTER.  
Jonas turns to Suyin -- what gives?
 SUYIN
 I told father if we were going 
shark hunting then he needed to 
evacuate all non-essential 
personnel to Hainan.  Including...
 Meiying
 , who is standing with Zhang, arms crossed.  Visibly 
upset at her mother.
 INT. DIVE CYLINDER - NOW UNDERWATER
 The cylinder drops quickly.  The invisible walls create an 
astonishing visual, as if Fan is standing underwater.  LIGHTS 
snap ON and THE EXTERNAL CAMERAS position themselves. 
INT. DIVE ROOM - MAZU - CONTINUED
 Just inside the aft deck, the ship’s dive room isn’t as fancy 
as the one on the Mana One. THERE’S A BANK OF SMALL TV 
MONITORS showing FAN and VARIOUS CAMERAS’ POVs.  THERE’S A 
SONAR SCREEN.  CRANE/WINCH controls.  And a MIC.  
MAC (MIC)
 Radio check.  
He looks at the MONITOR as FAN gives him a thumbs up.
 MAC (MIC)
 Okay, taking you down to 100 
meters.
 EXT. MAZU - AFT-DECK - CONTINUED
 The WHINE of the winch lowering the Dive Cylinder is no match 
for the ROAR of the HELICOPTER ENGINE.  Non-Essential 
PERSONNEL are climbing aboard the chopper.  Then only MEIYING 
is left to get on-board.
 SUYIN
 (over the noise)
 I love you.  I’ll see you soon.
 Meiying turns to the helicopter but then... RUNS AWAY!
 SUYIN
 MEIYING!
66.
 Meiying disappears into the ship.  Suyin goes after her.
 MORRIS
 (to Zhang)
 Do you want them to wait?
 ZHANG
 (shakes his head no)
 We’ll put her on the next one.
 Morris NODS to the pilot.  The HELICOPTER lifts off.
 INT. DIVE CYLINDER - 100M BELOW THE SURFACE - NIGHT
 The DIVE CYLINDER stops
 at 100M below the surface.  The water 
surrounding it now a deep rich black.   Fan turns to a small 
CONTROL BOX - we see a series of switches marked “ELECTRICAL 
REPELLENT FIELD”.  Click - click - click.  She turns the 
FIELD ON.  For an INSTANT we see a tesla-coil like ELECTRICAL 
CHARGE shoot through the CLEAR material.
 INT. DIVE ROOM - MAZU - CONTINUED
 The entire team stand behind Mac, watching the monitors.
 MAC
 Okay, if that thing likes power, 
she just became the equivalent of a 
T-Bone steak.
 Jonas shakes his head.  That’s NOT a good thing.
 INT. DIVE CYLINDER - 100M BELOW THE SURFACE - NIGHT
 FAN’S POV - Nothing but deep, dark blue in every direction.  
We HEAR her breathing, she’s trying to stay calm...  But WHEN 
ALL YOU SEE IS DARK BLUE, WHEN YOU ARE WAITING for SOMETHING 
to appear, it is HARD TO STAY CALM.
 Is that something...?  No...  What about that? No...
 A 12-Foot GREAT WHITE passes over her head.  She gasps!
 INT. DIVE ROOM - MAZU - CONTINUED
 The Great White is visible on the monitors and the SONAR.
 HELLER
 Here comes a second one...
 They can see the SHARKS on the sonar, sometimes before they 
see them on the camera...
67.
 FRANCOIS
 And a third...
 DJ
 We’ve got ourselves a party.
 INT. DIVE CYLINDER - 100M BELOW THE SURFACE - NIGHT
 Drawn by the bait fish dangling off the rigging at the top of 
the cylinder, the GREAT WHITES continue to increase in 
number.  FAN tries to keep them all in sight as...
 NUDGE...ZAP!
 The first of the sharks grabs for a meal and finds out that 
the SELEXIS is ELECTRIFIED!  The shark recoils as the 
Cylinder rocks back and forth from the attempt.
 A SECOND SHARK and then a THIRD try their luck, but they meet 
the same painful fate.  FAN’s cylinder is swaying back and 
forth but she’s loving it, laughing, like she’s on an 
amusement park ride.
 Everywhere she looks she sees Great Whites, all of them 
amazing.  None of them what she’s hoping to see.
 And then, as she does a complete 360 turn in the cylinder, 
she begins to notice something:
 The Great Whites are vanishing
 .
 INT. DIVE ROOM - MAZU - CONTINUED
 Their retreat of is even more obvious on SONAR...
 MORRIS
 They’re getting frustrated.
 ZHANG
 No.  The only thing that can chase 
off a shark is... a larger shark.
 PING... PING...  There, on the sonar, we now see a shape FOUR 
TIMES LARGER than all the other shapes.
 FRANCOIS
 It’s the Meg.
 JONAS
 Get her out of there. 
PING... PING... It’s like watching a train coming at someone.
68.
 MAC
 (mic, calmly)
 Fan, here we go.  At your Six.
 INT. DIVE CYLINDER - 100M BELOW THE SURFACE - NIGHT
 Fan turns inside the cylinder to the direction Mac told her.   
She holds the spear gun tightly.  Eerie silence.  Her 
breathing the only sound besides Mac’s voice.  
MAC
 (radio, calm)
 I’ll count it down for you...
 FAN’S POV - as she prepares to see the monster...
 MAC
 (radio, calm)
 Five... Four...
 FAN’S POV - Spear Gun ready...
 MAC
 (radio, calm)
 Three... Two...
 FAN’S POV - Where is it!?
 MAC
 (radio, calm)
 One... And...
 FAN’S POV - She sees nothing.  SUDDENLY, she looks down as 
WHAM!  The MEG, which had been swimming DEEPER than she 
expected, SLAMS into the DIVE CYLINDER from below!
 THE IMPACT IS MASSIVE
 .  Sparks fly!  FAN is tossed across the 
cylinder, knocked senseless. 
She recovers, tries to relocate the Meg.  This time it comes 
from directly in front.  BAM! BAM!  The Meg slides across the 
cylinder, impervious to the electricity.  Now we see it lit 
up in all its glory.  A massive 35-foot wall of destruction. 
SMASH!  It knocks the cylinder completely HORIZONTAL!  
INT. DIVE ROOM - MAZU - CONTINUED
 Watching the MONITORS is disorienting, because everything is 
being knocked around.  Mac and the others see GLIMPSES of 
FAN... And then parts of the MEG... 
69.
 JONAS
 (loud)
 Come on, this is crazy, get her out 
of there!  
DIMITRI
 (louder)
 The cage - will - not - break!
 INT. DIVE CYLINDER - 100M BELOW THE SURFACE - NIGHT
 Fan steadies herself amidst the BASHING and the SWAYING.  She 
raises the SPEAR GUN and fires OFF THE PERFECT SHOT!
 The DART reaches the dorsal fin, but BOUNCES OFF harmlessly!  
The Meg’s skin just too tough to penetrate.
 The MEG seems to take the shot personally because it comes at 
Fan more aggressively than ever - HITTING THE CYLINDER AND 
SCRAPING along it, creating a dazzling display of electric 
fire, before disappearing into the void once again.
 Fan has a moment to reload.  
INT. DIVE ROOM - MAZU - CONTINUED
 They realize she fired...
 ZHANG (MIC)
 Fan, did you hit it?
 Fan raises her hand - fist closed.
 MAC
 Missed.
 INT. DIVE CYLINDER - 100M BELOW THE SURFACE - NIGHT
 Fan floats, waiting, searching the blue for what seems like 
an eternity.  Then the Meg pounces from the shadows...
 BUT THIS TIME WITH ITS JAWS OPEN WIDE - SO WIDE THAT THEY 
CHOMP DOWN ON THE CYLINDER - LIKE A DOG ON A CHEW TOY.
 The MEG tugs and pulls the CYLINDER back and forth, as if 
trying to free the ‘TOY’ from some imaginary ‘Master’s hand’
 BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! There go all but one of the cameras.
 INT. DIVE ROOM - MAZU - CONTINUED
 GRRRRRRRIIIIIIINNNNNNDDDDDD.... What’s that sound?  Jonas and 
Dimitri race back outside.
70.
 EXT. MAZU - AFT-DECK - CONTINUED
 What they see BOGGLES their minds.  That GRRIIINNNDDD is the 
sound of the DIVE CABLE FORCIBLY UNSPOOLING from ITS MASSIVE 
REEL. 
The Meg is pulling the Dive Cylinder Deeper a few feet at a 
time.  But that’s not the problem.  The problem is...
 CREAK. All that tension is putting a strain on the reel and 
crane.  Dimitri and Jonas both see it.  Dimitri goes pale.
 JONAS
 You’re right - the cage won’t 
break... The crane will! 
ON JONAS
 As he gets an idea and goes racing off, leaving Dimitri, who 
is now panicking and running back inside...
 DIMITRI
 We have to get her out of there! 
INT. DIVE CYLINDER - 100M BELOW THE SURFACE - NIGHT
 The MASSIVE JAWS surround Fan, desperately trying to snap her 
up.  The Dive Cylinder DEFORMS under the pressure, but 
doesn’t break, and it REBOUNDS to its normal shape any time 
the MEG loosens its grip.
 SLAM - SLAM - SLAM - SLAM - The Meg resumes yanking it back 
and forth, dragging it further and further down.
 Somehow FAN, who is being bounced around like a pinball, 
notices that there is less SCALY ARMOR on the UNDERSIDE of 
the Meg.  She aims for what is an impossible shot...
 Pfffft.... It’s a hit!  Right between the pectoral fins!  Fan 
let’s out a celebratory yell that no one hears as the Meg 
YANKS HER CYLINDER DOWN harder than ever! 
EXT. MAZU - AFT-DECK - CONTINUED
 Snap!  Snap!  The bolts at the base of the crane are 
literally being pulled from the deck.  And then, there is one 
final SHARP SNAP...!
 INT. DIVE CYLINDER - 100M BELOW THE SURFACE - NIGHT
 ...A SNAP that coincides with the Meg’s SUDDEN RETREAT.  For 
a moment, Fan is about to celebrate.  Then she looks up 
towards the MOONLIT SURFACE above her...
71.
 At first she sees a SHADOW, then she is able to make out the 
MASSIVE CRANE ARM hurtling towards her.  The Meg has ripped 
it off the deck.  The ARM will drag her to the bottom of the 
ocean, so she does the only thing she can, she opens the 
ESCAPE HATCH ON TOP OF THE DIVE CYLINDER...
 And she’s just clear of it when IT’S DRAGGED DOWN INTO THE 
DARKNESS...
 Fan finds herself floating, totally unprotected, 300 feet 
below the surface.  It doesn’t get much scarier than that.
 INT. DIVE ROOM - MAZU - CONTINUED
 The one CAMERA still working on the cage shows a view of FAN 
above...  And FAN’S CAMERA shows just how exposed she is.
 MAC
 She blew the hatch!  She’s in the 
water!  She’s in the water!  
EXT. MAZU - CONTINUED
 RRRREEEVVVV.  That’s the sound of Dimitri firing up a ZODIAC 
he’s launched off the far side of the ship.
 FRANCOIS
 Hang on...
 Francois comes leaping into the Zodiac, manning the controls.
 FRANCOIS
 I’ll drive, you grab her.
 He SHOVES the DUAL THROTTLES forward to the stops. 
EXT. OCEAN - 75 METERS DOWN
 Fan kicking for the moonlit surface, still a long way to go.  
Beneath her, in the dark, we see OCCASIONAL BURSTS OF 
ELECTRICITY as the MEG continues to attack the Dive Cylinder.
 There is a real rhythm to Meg’s strikes.  We see LIGHT then 
dark.  LIGHT then dark.  But then LIGHT stops...
 EXT. OCEAN - 300 METERS DOWN
 We see the Dive Cylinder now in free-fall.  The MEG has 
ABANDONED it.  No longer interested in the ‘Toy’...
 MEG’S POV
 There’s something tastier high up above.
72.
 EXT. OCEAN - FAN’S POV - 20 METERS DOWN
 She’s breathing heavy.  The promise of the surface so close!
 EXT. OCEAN - MEG’S POV
 The moving figure of FAN is getting larger.
 EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT
 Fan explodes onto the surface, spits out her regulator, 
SCREAMS for help.
 EXT. OCEAN - MEG’S POV
 All it sees is FAN now.  This is going to be delicious...
 ...Then SOMETHING comes plowing through FRAME from left to 
right...
 ...we KNOW it’s the ZODIAC.  But all the MEG knows is once 
this thing has passed... Fan has vanished.
 EXT. OCEAN - ON THE ZODIAC - NIGHT
 Fan is coughing and breathless in Dimitri’s arms.
 FAN
 I got the shot...
 Francois, piloting them back to the Mazu at full throttle, 
shakes his head in amazement. Dimitri looks into Fan’s eyes.  
DIMITRI
 Of course you did.  Because you are 
the most bad-ass woman----Dimitri doesn’t get to finish that lovely thought because 
suddenly ALL OF THEM ARE FLYING OUT OF CONTROL IN THE AIR...
 ...THROWN FAR FROM THE ZODIAC - WHICH IS ALSO HURTLING 
THROUGH THE SKY - END OVER END.
 EXT. AFT DECK - THE MAZU
 Mac, Zhang and the others look on helplessly as THE MEG has 
smashed the Zodiac and now has three meals to choose from.
 EXT. OCEAN - CONTINUED
 Francois is closest to the Zodiac, which has settled in the 
water upside down, so he swims for it while Dimitri and Fan 
race towards the Mazu.  
73.
 Francois reaches the Zodiac and is about to climb on board 
when SOMETHING knocks him from below - sending him back 
across the surface about ten feet.  
Francois’s face wrinkles.  He’s in pain, but still mobile.  
He swims for the Zodiac and as he’s about to climb on -- HE’S 
KNOCKED back again.
 FRANCOIS
 Are you playing with me?!  Is that 
it?!
 He swims for the Zodiac a third time and MAKES IT!
 EXT. OCEAN - ON THE OVER-TURNED ZODIAC - NIGHT
 Francois collapses flat on his back.  Safe for the moment. 
Still waters.  The only noise - his own heavy breathing.  
And then we hear the unmistakable sound of rushing water.  
Francois’ heavy breathing turns to laughter, as he takes a 
moment, and enjoys the full moon as it hangs low in the sky.
 FRANCOIS
 I hope I give you indigestion.
 WHOOOOMMMMMPPPP - In a blur, the massive jaws of the Meg 
break the surface.  The Meg clamps down.  The Pressurized Air 
in the ZODIAC EXPLODES and Francois’ blood sprays across the 
blue skies before raining down like a fine mist.
 EXT. MAZU - PORT DECK
 Suyin prepares to lower another Zodiac.  DJ sees that.
 DJ
 Suyin, that’s suicide.
 SUYIN
 Yeah.  Now are you going to help or 
what?!
 DJ nods.  Of course he’s going to help.
 EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT
 Dimitri and Fan keep swimming.  Even after the echo of 
Francois’ scream fades.
 THEN THEY HEAR IT...
 Like a jet engine ripping across the water.  It’s the DORSAL 
FIN of the Meg.  Just barely breaking the surface, but 
74.
 leaving a tremendous wake behind it, creating the visual 
effect of a giant invisible monster coming right for them.
 DIMITRI
 (stops swimming)
 You know that joke, you don’t have 
to be faster than the shark, you 
just have to be faster than me? 
But Fan can tell even if Dimitri sacrifices himself first, it 
won’t make a difference.  So she stops too.
 FAN
 He gets you, then he gets me.  Let 
him get us together.  
They embrace, at least they wont die alone.  
FAN
 I might love you.
 DIMITRI
 I’ll take it.
 The sound of that dorsal is as loud as a JET-ENGINE on take
off now.  It’s about to reach them...
 EXT. OCEAN - BELOW THE SURFACE - SAME
 We see the MEG opening its jaws, about to bite when...
 WHIIIISHHHHHH THHHUUUUUUD!  Some kind of PROJECTILE on a 
chain SLAMS into the Meg’s side!  REVEAL-
INT. FASTBACK ONE - JONAS
 JONAS, in Suyin’s Abyss Glider, has FIRED THE PORT HORIZONTAL 
ANCHOR (that we saw Suyin and DJ use earlier) INTO THE MEG.
 Jonas then inverts his Abyss Glider UPSIDE DOWN...
 EXT. OCEAN - BELOW THE SURFACE SAME
 ...So that now the right ‘wing’ has a shot.  He fires a 
SECOND ANCHOR into the beast’s side.  These are fatal wounds.  
But not instantaneously fatal.  And as the Abyss Glider and 
the shark are now linked twice, it means Jonas is about to be 
in for a wild ride.  
We see the shark turn and twist...
 INT. FASTBACK ONE - JONAS
 Jonas braces himself as the anchor chains go taut. 
75.
 JONAS
 This is gonna hurt-
WHIRL-SPIN-SMASH-BANG!
 The Abyss Glider is violently accelerated and decelerated in 
every direction.  It’s like being on a roller coaster and the 
bumper cars at the same time.  With a touch of bull rider.
 EXT. OCEAN - SAME
 The good news is DJ AND SUYIN, in their Zodiac, reach DIMITRI 
and FAN and pull them from the water.
 FAN
 What happened?
 SUYIN
 (indicates the ocean)
 Jonas.
 From the surface, they can see GLIMPSES - THROUGH THE DARK 
OCEAN WATERS - of the VIOLENT BALLET BELOW.  The bloody MEG 
twisting and turning.  And the ABYSS GLIDER at its mercy.
 INT.  FASTBACK ONE - JONAS
 Jonas, totally disoriented, blows the emergency BALLAST tanks 
just as he’s THROWN FROM his seat when his HARNESS BREAKS.  
His head smashes against the cockpit.  Knocking him out cold. 
INT. SHIP’S INFIRMARY - MAZU - NIGHT
 CUT TO BLACK
 :
 A LIGHT shines into ‘our eyes’.  Dr. HELLER is the source of 
it...  We are...
 JONAS
 (weakly)
 Hey.
 Jonas rests on a bed, nursing the world’s worst headache. 
MEIYING holds his hand for comfort.  SUYIN is with her, and 
MAC lurks unseen by Jonas off to the side, WORRIED.
 JONAS (CONT’D)
 How long was I out, Doc?
 HELLER
 A few minutes. Hopefully, it’s just 
a concussion, but we’re going to 
run a battery of tests once we get 
you back to the Mana One.
76.
 Now Jonas sees MAC.  Makes eye contact with his friend.
 JONAS
 Doc, I think I’m hallucinating.  I 
see a monster behind you...
 Meiying starts to cackle. 
MAC
 Okay, he’s fine.
 Mac gives Jonas, ‘I’m glad you’re okay’ nod, before 
disappearing off screen.  Jonas turns to Suyin:
 JONAS
 What happened to the Meg?
 EXT. AFT DECK - THE MAZU - SUNRISE
 The Mazu’s remaining CRANE ARM is HOISTING the DEAD MEG out 
of the water by its tail as DJ, FAN, and MORRIS look on.
 MORRIS
 It’s spectacular...
 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MAZU - CONTINUED
 Mac sees the Meg coming up and then looks away, looks back to 
where DIMITRI is showing ZHANG PHOTOGRAPHS OF the SMASHED 
UNIS BOT that is partially wedged into the thermal vent.
 ZHANG
 So we are the reason it could get 
through the thermocline.
 Dimitri nods. 
DIMITRI
 Based on where our BOTS were 
placed, I’d say that’s BOT 14.
 MAC
 Whacked into the side of that vent 
like a tennis ball.
 DIMITRI
 Not a tennis ball, a thumb.
 (Mac doesn’t understand)
 The Bot’s partially obstructing the 
flow of hot water out the vent - 
like a thumb over a garden hose -  
increasing the power of the water 
that does jet out...
77.
 ZHANG
 ...Creating a warm water hole up 
through the thermocline.  A hole 
we’re going to have to close.
 DIMITRI
 As soon as we get back to the Mana
One, I can have the BOT self
destruct via remote.
 EXT. AFT DECK - THE MAZU - SUNRISE
 All 35-feet of the MEG is now out of the water.  Its tail 
high in the air.  Its once fearsome jaws now hovering a few 
feet above the water.  
DJ and FAN sit side-by-side on folding chairs, just staring 
at the beast.  The reverent silence is broken by...
 MORRIS 
Will one of you take my picture?
 She holds out her camera phone.  Is she for real?  Finally, 
Fan relents. 
MORRIS 
Either of you want to join me?  
FAN 
I just had a meet and greet with 
that thing’s digestive tract, so 
I’m going to skip the photo op. 
Click - Fan takes the shot.  She hands Morris her camera 
phone back.  Morris realizes she may seem a tad insensitive.
 MORRIS
 It’s been an emotional day.  But I 
want you both to remember, what 
you’ve done here is unprecedented.  
You’re part of something truly 
historic.  
Morris walks back inside the ship.  Once she’s gone-
FAN
 Is it just me, or were there actual 
dollar signs in her eyes?
 Fan chuckles.  DJ is stoic.
 FAN (CONT’D)
 “Hey guys, how long do you think it 
would it take to train a Megaladon 
(MORE)
FAN (CONT’D)
 78.
 to do water ballet” 
(shakes her head)
 I swear, if she comes back with a 
saddle, I’m going home. 
DJ nods vacantly.  Not really listening to her.
 FAN (CONT’D)
 What’s wrong? 
DJ
 Nothing.
 FAN
 Remember the last time we played 
poker?  Remember what happened?
 DJ
 People focus too much on results...
 FAN
 I cleaned you out. Because you have 
the world’s worst poker face.  Now 
what is wrong?
 DJ
 (beat)
 That’s not the same Meg.
 INTERCUT - INT. SHIP’S INFIRMARY - MAZU - DAY
 Where Jonas has just told Suyin a similar thought.
 SUYIN
 What do you mean, that’s not the 
same Meg?
 Jonas tries to sit up, but he’s too dizzy. 
JONAS
 How big is it?  Thirty feet?  
SUYIN
 Thirty-five.
 JONAS
 The one we saw below.  The one that 
killed Junjie, Carl, and Luc.  It 
was twice that size.  You said so 
yourself.
79.
 SUYIN
 You think there are two Megs? My 
father was surprised even one 
followed DJ’s trail because-
JONAS
 (a step ahead of her)--Because sharks are territorial, 
he’s right.  Assuming Megs behave 
like other sharks, it should have 
stayed down there.  Unless...
 (she waits for it)
 Mature sharks don’t go exploring 
new ground, they stay where they 
know the food is.  Juveniles on the 
other hand...
 ON SUYIN - as she grasps the meaning of what Jonas is saying.
 EXT. AFT DECK - THE MAZU - MOMENTS LATER
 DJ and Fan continue to debate.
 DJ
 Fan, I’m telling you, it didn’t 
look bigger, it was bigger...
 FAN
 And DJ, I’m telling you, as someone 
who curled up inside that thing’s 
mouth, I can say with all 
confidence, that is the Meg.
 SUYIN arrives and heads straight for the Meg. 
DJ
 Suyin, settle something for us...
 But Suyin doesn’t even acknowledge them, she’s so focused on 
RAIDING a SUPPLY chest - grabbing a HARNESS, a BLOWTORCH, and 
some EYE PROTECTION. 
FAN
 Suyin?
 Suyin climbs halfway up the CRANE, attaches her HARNESS, then 
REPELS down the side of the MEG.  She reaches into the mouth, 
GRABS ON, and then pulls herself up and INSIDE the carcass.
 INT. MEG’S MOUTH / EXT. MAZU - CONTINUED
 The darkness disappears as Suyin sparks up her blowtorch. 
80.
 EXT. AFT DECK - THE MAZU - CONTINUED
 Suyin’s operation attracts the attention of MORRIS, who comes 
running back in-
MORRIS
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you 
doing?  We’re going to want that 
thing to look perfect!
 SLIDE - That’s the sound that a MEG’S TOOTH, now liberated 
from the jaw, makes as it SKIDS across the deck and stops at 
FAN’S FEET.  As Fan bends down to pick it up...
 ...Suyin pushes off the side of the shark, SWINGS out over 
the ocean, and then back towards the deck.  She RELEASES the 
harness and lands in a trot towards her friends as MORRIS, 
annoyed, rushes over to the Meg to inspect the damage.
 MORRIS (CONT’D)
 What were you thinking?!
 FAN now has the tooth in her hands.  She uses the ruler on 
her iPhone to measure the size.  Then her face goes pale.  
She looks at SUYIN.  Suyin nods.
 FAN
 (realizes)
 This is a baby.
 SUYIN
 And the one below, wasn’t.  So...
 The women exchange a look.  Fan almost dizzy from the news.
 DJ
 Can one of you translate please?
 SUYIN
 This Megaladon’s teeth are 8 cm.  8 
cm means this monster is actually 
just a kid.  Maybe 6 months old.  
FAN
 And while sharks aren’t very 
loving, mothers usually stay close 
to their offspring for the first 
year.
 MORRIS, who is right at the ship’s edge, and had been 
mourning the damage done to her prize, suddenly BRIGHTENS 
like it’s Christmas morning.
81.
 MORRIS
 (excited)
 Wait are you saying there’s a 
bigger Meg?
 THE ANSWER -- COMES IN HORRIFYING SCALE AND VIOLENCE.  As 
suddenly the OCEAN BEHIND THE MAZU EXPLODES.
 THE ‘MOMMA’ MEGALADON comes flying out of the water at a 
sideways angle.  She’s so massive that her arrival BLOCKS OUT 
THE SUN, ECLIPSING THE MAZU, as her MIGHTY JAWS SNATCH the 
smaller Meg that was once her child but is now her meal.
 MORRIS’S POV -- All she sees is Shark.  It would be her dream 
come true except for the fact that-
! 
THOOMP! The MEG takes Morris with it as it DISAPPEARS into 
the sea
 But not before... SMASH...!  Its MASSIVE TAIL crashes through 
the AFT DECK of the Mazu with SUCH FORCE that the ship 
PITCHES NOSE UP INTO THE AIR before SLAMMING BACK DOWN. 
DJ’S POV - FOR A MOMENT - THINGS ARE DISORIENTING.  There’s 
NO SOUND, vision is BLURRY... Then, when the SOUND comes back 
it’s FILLED WITH DEAFENING SIRENS.   And when VISION is 
restored, we see part of the aft deck is gone completely.
 Fan and Suyin, both having nearly fallen into the sea, regain 
their feet.  Fan looks around for Morris.
 FAN
 Is she...?
 Suyin shakes her head.  Morris is gone.  And the ship is 
starting to sink.  The two women collect DJ, who can only 
process what’s happened though gallows humor.
 DJ
 That settles the bigger Meg debate.
 INT. SHIP’S INFIRMARY - MAZU - MOMENTS LATER
 Jonas, having been tossed like a rag doll gets to his feet.
 JONAS
 (to Meiying)
 Are you okay?
 MEIYING
 What’s happening?!
 JONAS
 We’ve gotta get out of here.
82.
 INT. CORRIDOR - ENGINE LEVEL - CONTINUED
 MAC runs through a gauntlet of FLASHING LIGHTS towards the 
engine room.  He runs into DIMITRI, who is just coming from 
there.  They have to YELL over the siren to be heard.
 DIMITRI
 THE PROPS ARE GONE, BOTH ENGINES 
ARE BLOWN AND WE’VE GOT NO RUDDER!
 MAC
 NOW COMES THE PART WHERE YOU TELL 
ME YOU CAN FIX IT SO YOU LOOK LIKE 
A HERO!
 DIMITRI
 THE ONLY PLACE THIS SHIP IS GOING - 
IS DOWN - AND FAST.
 INT. MAIN STAIRWELL - CORRIDOR - SECOND LEVEL - MAZU
 Jonas and Meiying run into DJ, Fan and...
 MEIYING
 MOMMY!
 SUYIN embraces her daughter as MAC and DIMITRI run up.  
JONAS
 How bad is it?
 Mac shakes his head.  We’re going down.  Off their looks:
 MAC
 It’s not all bad news.  Since we 
already took off non-essential 
personnel, we have enough Zodiacs 
for all of us.
 DJ
 Zodiacs?!  With that thing out 
there, are you nuts?
 FAN
 We still have the two subs.
 DIMITRI
 (shakes his head)
 Lost them with the aft deck.
 JONAS
 We need that helicopter.
 ZHANG arrives as if on cue, and he has good news.
83.
 ZHANG
 I already radioed them.  They’re 
three minutes out.
 Finally, a break
 .  
INT. MAZU - THE HATCH TO THE HELIPAD - MINUTES LATER - DAY
 The ENTIRE GROUP waits at the THRESHOLD OF THE HATCH that 
leads outside to the HELIPAD.   The Mazu is now LISTING 15 
DEGREES TO STARBOARD.  And the HELICOPTER, which they can see 
approaching, has WHEELS for landing gear.  This means:
 MAC
 We’re listing too much for them to 
land safely.  They’re going to have 
to use the basket - take us up one 
at time. 
JONAS
 How long will that take?!
 Mac looks Jonas - hopefully not too long.
 INT. THE HELICOPTER - CIRCLING
 In the belly of the Helicopter, the CO-PILOT finishes rigging 
A RESCUE BASKET to the winch.  He nods to the THIRD AIRMAN, 
it’s ready.  The Third Airman SLIDES THE SIDE DOOR OPEN.
 Now it’s incredibly loud in here. The THIRD AIRMAN and the CO
PILOT push the BASKET out. It FALLS a few feet before the 
rope catches.  Then the CO-PILOT turns on the WINCH.  
The line unspools and the basket drops slowly...
 INT. MAZU - THE HATCH TO THE HELIPAD - CONTINUED
 Jonas can see the basket now...
 JONAS
 Okay, it’s coming.
 Suyin, holding Meiying, will go first.  As they wait next to 
Jonas, he can tell the little girl is terrified.
 JONAS 
Have you got your dolphin on?
 (off her nod)
 Then you’re going to be okay.
 MEIYING
 Jonas, you know that’s just a 
superstition, right?
84.
 He laughs.  Smiles at her.  Then motions them to wait a few 
more seconds.  They watch the BASKET - getting closer.
 EXT. OCEAN - BELOW THE SURFACE
 MEG’S POV - From DOWN HERE the sky looks white.  And we can 
see the dark shape of the Mazu, which is too big to eat...  
Then there is the Helicopter which is too high in the sky...
 But then there is that BASKET, dangling there, like a treat.
 INT. HELICOPTER - CONTINUED
 The Third Airmen, looking down, judges the distance from the 
BASKET to the deck.  It’s nearly there.
 THIRD AIRMEN
 Looking good...
 He turns back for a moment, so he doesn’t see what WE SEE...
 ...  
IN SLOW MOTION - WITH ONLY SELECTED SOUNDS PIERCING THE 
SILENCE
 The MEG is coming straight at the surface, about to breach.
 EXT. HELIPAD - SLOW MOTION - SILENCE
 - CONTINUED
 Jonas is outside with Suyin and Meiying when THEY SEE THE MEG 
SOARING INTO THE SKY.  Our first look at the beast in ALL ITS 
IMPOSSIBLE GLORY.  70 feet long and 100 tons - yet it arcs 
through the air gracefully to snatch THE BASKET.
 JONAS -- turns and grabs Suyin/Meiying.  We HEAR his ‘GET 
BACK!!’ as he drives them inside the ship while...
 BEHIND JONAS -- the MEG PIVOTS around its meal, its head 
turning back seaward as its TAIL carries on towards the sky.
 INT. HELICOPTER - SLOW MOTION - SILENCE
 - CONTINUED
 We hear, distant and hollow, the sound of the pilot screaming 
to no one.   
‘POWER!... POWER!... POWER...!’
 EXT. MAZU/OCEAN - SLOW MOTION - SILENCE
 - CONTINUED
 The MEG, basket in mouth, begins to drag the Helicopter down.  
But then we hear a snap as, thankfully, the line breaks.  And 
the plunging Helicopter arrests its fatal descent.
 INT. HELICOPTER - SLOW MOTION - SILENCE
 - CONTINUED
 The PILOT breaks into a smile.  We hear the joy in his 
distant, hollow sounding voice - “WE’RE GONNA MAKE IT!”...
85.
 Then the MEG’S TAIL rises into FRAME outside the cockpit.
 PILOT
 Oh sh-
EXT. MAZU/OCEAN - RESUME FULL SPEED
 SMASH!  The Tail of the Meg SLAMS INTO THE HELICOPTER, 
sending the Helicopter careening into the Mazu.
 INT. MAZU - JUST INSIDE THE HATCH TO THE HELIPAD
 Jonas pulls the HATCH shut as -- BA-BLAM! -- The Helicopter 
EXPLODES with tremendous force and a noise so deafening that, 
after it’s over, our group is surprised to be unhurt.
 EXT. HELIPAD - MOMENTS LATER
 Jonas opens the HATCH to see if there are any survivors.   
But the deck is just filled with burning debris.
 JONAS
 (long beat, to Mac)
 How many Zodiacs do we have?
 EXT. MAZU/OCEAN - WIDE SHOT - DAY
 The Mazu is listing badly, soon it will roll over.  
EXT. MAZU - STARBOARD SIDE - DAY
 CUT TO:
 THREE EMPTY ZODIACS float, tied to the deck.  TWO are full
sized.  ONE is smaller.  As everyone prepares to board, MAC 
raises a pair of binoculars/laser ranger finder to his eyes.
 MAC’S POV - THROUGH THE RANGE FINGER
 The Mana-One looks huge at this magnification.  And the 
DISTANCE, per the little red digital read out, is...
 MAC
 1 and 1/4 miles.
 DIMITRI
 So about five minutes.
 Looks are exchanged among the group.  That’s not a lot of 
time.  And yet, why does it feel like an eternity?
 JONAS
 Does anyone see the Meg?
86.
 ZHANG looks at his watch, he’d set his timer.
 ZHANG
 Not for almost seven minutes now.
 It’s now or never
 .  The group jumps in quickly...
 BOAT 1 - has DJ, MAC, and FAN
 BOAT 2 - has JONAS, SUYIN, MEIYING and ZHANG 
BOAT 3 - (the smaller one) - has DIMITRI and HELLER.
 Before they fire up their engines, Zhang reminds them:
 ZHANG 
Predatory instinct is to look for 
the weak link.  If we stay 
together, we have a better chance 
of all of us making it.  
(exhales)
 I just want to say...
 ...but words fail him then.  He feels responsible for every 
person out here and that is weighing on him.  
MAC
 You can finish that on the 
platform.  Because we’re all making 
it and that’s an order.
 SUYIN
 (scans the horizon)
 Looks clear.
 Three boats, Nine people, Eighteen eyes all search for the 70
foot beast.  But the ocean is calm.  They have a chance.
 EXT.  OCEAN - MOMENTS LATER--SFX: ENGINES AND WIND
 The THREE ZODIACS bound across the sea.  At this speed, the 
WIND, ENGINES, and SEA SPRAY combine in a sensory overload.  
THE BOATS stay close together. The three pilots:  JONAS, 
DIMITRI, and MAC do an excellent job staying in formation.
 VARIOUS POV’S - OF THE WATER
 Everyone has a moment where they think they see it.  There, 
off to the left... No, behind us on the right... A passing 
clump of SEAWEED nearly gives DJ a heart-attack.
87.
 BUT THE TRUTH IS -- There is no sign of the Meg
 .
 QUICK CUTS - CLOSE-UPS 
JONAS keeps his eyes fixed on the Mana-One.  SUYIN holds 
MEIYING close.  ZHANG whispers a prayer.
 The seas are clear
 .
 MAC scans the horizon, DJ eyes the floor.  FAN looks two 
boats across at DIMITRI.
 The seas still clear
 DIMITRI eyes the gauges.  And HELLER...  Heller allows 
himself the first hint of a SMILE...  
DJ--THERE IT IS!
 THEIR POV
 A MASSIVE DORSAL FIN is circling the sinking MAZU about 1/2 
mile behind them.
 THEY ALL WATCH
 As the DORSAL FIN moves languidly, in profile, perpendicular 
to the Zodiacs, seemingly disinterested.  And for a moment, 
it really seems as if the Meg doesn’t care about them.
 BUT THEN THE DORSAL FIN TURNS
 Straight for them.  A wake grows as the Meg ACCELERATES, and 
the fin sinks low in the water as its speed builds.
 JONAS
 (calls to other boats)
 STAY TOGETHER!
 THE MEG’S SPEED is breath-taking.   It becomes clear...
 ZHANG
 It’s going to reach us before we 
make it to the platform.
 EXT. OCEAN - BEHIND THE ZODIACS
 Speeding along with the MEG as it closes in fast.
 INT. ZODIAC ONE - DJ, FAN, AND MAC
 DJ sees that the Meg is angling for their boat or Suyin’s.
88.
 DJ
 MAC!
 MAC
 I’M GOING AS FAST AS I CAN!
 JONAS (O.S.)
 (distant, faint)
 Stay together...
 INT. ZODIAC THREE - HELLER AND DIMITRI
 HELLER watches, horrified, as it becomes clear the MEG is 
going to take down one of the other two boats.
 DIMITRI
 (not aware of that)
 WE’RE HALFWAY THERE!
 When he hears nothing in response, DIMITRI GLANCES BACK.  He 
sees the MEG is going for Boat 1 or Boat 2.  He looks at FAN 
in Boat 1...  And the fear of losing her grips him.
 JONAS (O.S.)
 (distant, faint)
 Stay together...
 HELLER
 To his credit, may not have a loved one on those boats, but 
he can tell his partner does.  He can also do the math. There 
are only two people in this boat.  It is a logical sacrifice.
 HELLER
 (to Dimitri)
 He’s wrong. If we stay together, 
the MEG will get two of us before 
we make the platform.  But if one 
boat peels off and leads it away...
 DIMITRI processes what Heller is suggesting.  He nods at 
Heller and Heller nods back.  It’s agreed.  We’ll do this.
 INT. ZODIAC TWO - JONAS, SUYIN, MEIYING, AND ZHANG
 JONAS sees HELLER looking his way.  Heller gives him a 
salute.  It’s both an apology and a goodbye.
 INT. ZODIAC ONE - FAN, DJ, AND MAC
 FAN sees Dimitri staring at her.  Like he’s looking at her 
for the last time.  And then she knows at once.
89.
 FAN
 No... No... NO...!
 INT. ZODIAC THREE - DIMITRI AND ZHANG 
DIMITRI turns the wheel and angles off
 .
 QUICK CUTS BETWEEN ZODIACS ONE AND TWO
 As the others react to the sacrifice.  Zhang looks at the men 
with pure admiration and heartbreaking guilt.  Fan’s I love 
you’s are heard only by the wind.
 EXT. OCEAN - WIDE
 Dimitri begins a wide, sweeping turn, which DRAWS the MEG 
off.  He brings the ZODIAC to a heading that eventually is 
almost directly away from the other boats.
 HEAVEN’S POV
 From up here, we see the geography of the sacrifice, as 
ZODIACS 1 and 2 are now separating from the MEG and ZODIAC 3.   
INT. ZODIAC THREE - DIMITRI AND HELLER
 The two men stand side by side, looking straight ahead, not 
seeing the death that bears down on them from behind.
 They face the sun, they face the light.  They can HEAR the 
Meg behind them now.  Then the sun GROWS IMPOSSIBLY WHITE-
INT. ZODIAC TWO - SUYIN, MEIYING, AND JONAS
 CUT TO:
 Suyin angles Meiying away so she doesn’t see the EXPLOSION OF 
WATER in the distance.  There’s nothing too graphic about it.  
And no screams can be heard.  Just a giant burst of water and 
then a terrible SILENCE.
 INT. ZODIAC ONE - DJ, FAN, AND MAC
 Fan buries her head in her hands, sobbing.
 INT. ZODIAC TWO - SUYIN, MEIYING, AND JONAS
 Jonas catches Suyin’s tear soaked eyes; one thing that gives 
him great solace is that the MEG is too far away to be a 
threat now.  To either boat.
 JONAS
 We’re going to make it.  We’re both 
going to make it.
90.
 EXT. WATER - DAY
 The Zodiacs PASS BY CAMERA, heading for the sanctuary of MANA 
ONE.  And we FADE...
 TO BLACK
 :
 INT. DIVE CONTROL CENTER - DAY
 For a moment there is no SOUND... Just IMAGES... 
A HAND along the back of Dimitri’s chair, which still bares 
the IMPRINT of Dimitri’s back.
 SUYIN (FAINT, DISTANT)
 Fan...
 FINGERS tracing some DESIGN DOODLES that Dimitri had been 
scribbling...
 SUYIN (FAINT, DISTANT)
 Fan...
 Finally stopping on a QUICK SKETCH Dimitri made of Fan 
herself, when she wasn’t looking.  
ALL SOUND RETURNS-
SUYIN
 Fan?  Are you going to be okay?  
Because we need you. 
Before she can answer, Fan feels a TUG at her side.  MEIYING 
is there, offering her a sip of her SODA.  Fan touches 
Meiying’s cheek: ‘No, but thanks.’ 
FAN
 (to Suyin)
 I’m good.
 SUYIN
 Ping Bot 14 and see if it responds.  
We need to close that hole in the 
thermocline.
 ON MEIYING - watching as FAN and SUYIN go to work.  Then 
turning to see JONAS, MAC and DJ in a heated conversation. 
Meiying exhales.  Not interested in either talk.
 INT. OBSERVATION LEVEL (O-LEVEL) - MOMENTS LATER
 Ding.  The elevator opens and MEIYING steps out into the all
glass world of the O-LEVEL.
91.
 She walks forward, drawn by something she sees IN THE OCEAN, 
beyond the RIM of the structure.  She reaches the end, 
extends her hands, her fingers tracing the glass.  
A HUMPBACK WHALE rolls gracefully onto its belly, its NEWBORN 
CALF close to its side.  Meiying smiles.
 FAN (PRE-LAP)
 Internal cooling off... Pressure 
regulators shut down...
 INT. DIVE CONTROL CENTER - DAY
 The TACTICAL DISPLAY showing data from BOT 14 begins to flash 
red.  Fan’s fingers fly across the keyboard-
FAN
 ...Bot self-destruct in 10.  5.  
EXT. DEEP OCEAN - BOT 14 - WEDGED IN THE THERMAL VENT
 BLAM!!  Bot 14 explodes with a flash.  Its pieces jetted 
upward by the power of the THERMAL VENT, then scattered.
 The TELL TALE COLUMN OF SUPER-HEATED WATER, which had 
stretched upwards like a TRANSLUCENT elevator shaft, 
DISAPPEARS
 .
 INT. DIVE CONTROL CENTER - DAY
 Fan turns to Suyin, Mac, DJ and Jonas.  She smiles.
 FAN
 The hole is gone.
 MAC
 So nothing else can get up here.
 DJ
 Yeah, but that also means what came 
up is staying up. 
JONAS
 The Meg was never going back down.  
Where it came from it was just 
another part of the food chain.  
Maybe not even the baddest thing on 
the block.  But up here...
 INT. OBSERVATION LEVEL (O-LEVEL) - DAY
 Meiying, face pressed against the glass, delights in watching 
the Whales.
92.
 JONAS (V.O.)
 Up here, she’s the apex predator, 
with no natural enemies, and an 
unlimited supply of food.
 INT. DIVE CONTROL CENTER - DAY
 The sound of the DOOR.  A frustrated Dr. Zhang enters.
 ZHANG
 The Navy is sending a helicopter 
for us, ETA 40 minutes.
 JONAS
 What about the Meg?
 ZHANG
 They’re running my request for 
military support up the line, but 
it’s not like they have a protocol 
to deal with this-
JONAS--Because they don’t believe it.
 The reality of that hangs there.  Suyin shakes her head-
SUYIN
 Well, they’re about to...
 She indicates the waters NORTH of HAINAN ISLAND on the map.
 SUYIN (CONT’D)
 Half the fishing fleet is working 
these waters.  That’s fifty, sixty 
boats.  And the Meg is gonna tear 
right through them.  After that 
comes 30,000 tourists on the 
beaches at Sanya Bay----SLAM
 .  The DCC is rocked by an IMPACT
 .  Something has hit 
them.  Reflexively, Fan pulls up CAMERA FEEDS of THE WATERS 
SURROUNDING THE MANA-ONE.  That something is the MEG.
 DJ
 Looks like she’s got some 
unfinished business first.
 Several MONITORS now show various angles of the massive beast 
rushing the Mana-One. 
MAC
 Hang on!
93.--SLAM
 !  THIS IMPACT is stronger.  An EXPLOSION of concussive 
force that triggers A DEAFENING CACOPHONY OF ALARMS-
FAN
 WE’VE GOT BREACHES!  TAKING ON 
WATER AT D-LEVEL, F-LEVEL, J-LEVEL-
SUYIN turns to check on Meiying -- only to realize her 
daughter isn’t there
 .
 Meiying!--SLAM
 !  
SUYIN
 This THIRD IMPACT is THE KNOCK-OUT PUNCH.  One by 
one, every system shuts down:  THUNK - THUNK - THUNK - THUNK.  
And they are plunged into TOTAL DARKNESS.
 EXT/INT. OBSERVATION LEVEL (O-LEVEL) - DAY
 We’re looking in at Meiying from outside the glass.  Behind 
her, the lights go out, but she doesn’t notice because she’s 
TRANSFIXED by what’s unfolding in front of her.
 IN THE REFLECTION OF THE GLASS, we can see the two whales. 
The Mother Whale is being shaken violently. 
REVEAL - the MEG has the whale in her jaws and is ripping it 
to pieces.  It‘s a staggering demonstration of the true power 
of this beast - now unleashed in our world.  As blood POURS 
from the dying whale, the sea becomes a THICK RED FOG-
INT. DIVE CONTROL CENTER - DAY
 ALARMS still screaming.  SUYIN (with JONAS) JABS repeatedly 
at the elevator button, but it won’t work until-
FAN
 EMERGENCY POWER -- ON-LINE!
 DARKNESS is replaced by eerie RED LIGHTING and -- DING the 
ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN.  As Jonas and Suyin head down to get 
Meiying, Fan checks the damage control screen.
 MAC
 How bad is it?
 FAN
 Worse.
 INT. OBSERVATION LEVEL - DAY
 Meiying stares out at the thick red fog (blood).  Then, it 
begins to clear in front of her.  Revealing A BLACK HOLE.
94.
 Ding.  JONAS AND SUYIN arrive.  And what they see causes 
their hearts to skip a beat.  That’s not
 a BLACK HOLE...
 IT’S THE MEG.
 EXT. OBSERVATION LEVEL - SAME
 The MEG hovers in the current, its side abutting the O-level, 
its MASSIVE EYE inches away from Suyin’s little girl.
 INT. OBSERVATION LEVEL - CONTINUED
 For a beat, no one dares move.  Then the EYE darts away-
JONAS
 SUYIN, GO!-
SUYIN races down the glass ‘spoke’ to save her daughter while 
the MEG makes a 270-degree turn and comes at Meiying head-on.  
Jaws opening...
 IT ALL HAPPENS IN LESS THAN A SECOND
 Suyin grabs Meiying and dives laterally, running along the 
rim of the station just as -- SMASH -- the MEG hits!  It 
obliterates the place where Meiying just stood, and destroys 
THAT ENTIRE CORRIDOR/SPOKE, as if it were made of smoke.
 AUTOMATIC PRESSURE DOORS
 Seal off the O-level where that SPOKE used to be as SMASH - 
SMASH - the MEG takes out TWO MORE SPOKES - plowing through 
them sideways -  before diving away.   
JONAS
 (watching the Meg)
 IT’S COMING AROUND! 
INT. O-LEVEL - 4TH SPOKE - DAY
 Suyin and Meiying reach the next intact ‘spoke’ - turn - and 
sprint for the elevator.  Suyin can see the MEG coming at 
them from directly below.  They aren’t going to make it
 .
 IN SLOW-MOTION
 Suyin LEAPS into the air and THROWS her daughter forward, as 
the CORRIDOR beneath them SHATTERS from the Meg’s impact.
 Still airborne, Meiying and Suyin suddenly collide with 
JONAS, sliding into frame so as to CATCH MEIYING and PULL 
SUYIN through the-
RAPIDLY CLOSING PRESSURE DOORS-
95.
 Which SNAP SHUT just after they’re all safely on the elevator 
side. 
RESUME - FULL SPEED 
SLAM!  The Meg obliterates Spoke 4 -- and Jonas, Suyin, and 
Meiying FALL BACKWARDS into the ELEVATOR as its doors close.
 CUT TO:
 INT. DIVE CONTROL CENTER - DEAFENING ALARMS - DAY
 Everyone has been knocked to the floor.  ELECTRICAL ARCS 
spark around them.  WATER jets through SEAMS IN THE WALLS.
 FAN struggles to her knees and finds herself looking at 
MEIYING’S SODA CAN as it is CRUSHED by an invisible hand!  
FAN
 DR. ZHANG!...
 Plastic bottles of water collapse in on themselves.  Plasma 
screens explode as if hit by unseen hammers.
 Zhang looks at the INTERNAL PRESSURE GAUGES.  They are sky
rocketing into the RED.  Heading for fatal levels fast.
 ZHANG
 THE PRESSURE VESSEL IS FAILING.  WE 
HAVE TO GET TOPSIDE, NOW-
Ding -- JONAS, SUYIN, and MEIYING arrive in the Elevator.
 JONAS
 Going up?
 INT. FREIGHT ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER
 It’s a long ride to the top. Anxious silence until...
 SCRAAAAAAYYYY... They begin to hear a TERRIBLE SOUND.  A 
sound that grows LOUDER as they reach the top deck and the 
doors OPEN on to-
EXT. MANA-ONE - MAIN PLATFORM - DAY--A sight out of Dante
 .   Black SMOKE swirls in the wind.  
FIRES burn across the deck.  And that SCRAAAAYYYY - is the 
MANA-ONE’s LOADING CRANE as it comes CRASHING to the deck!
 SMASH! - the crane hits just a few feet in front them!  When 
the dust clears, the group take stock of their situation.
96.
 ON JONAS - as he stares at the fallen CRANE.  Something about 
it triggers an idea in his mind...  He starts to think...
 DJ
 How long before that helicopter 
gets here!?
 ZHANG
 30 minutes.
 ON JONAS - STILL THINKING - It’s just an ordinary crane...  
Ordinary construction crane... Construction...
 DJ
 30 minutes?  This thing will be at 
the bottom of the ocean in 30 
minutes!
 ON JONAS - As the idea snaps into place.  
JONAS
 It’s enough time.
 DJ
 For what?
 JONAS
 For us to kill that Meg
 .
 FAN
 (lights up)
 Now we’re talking.
 But the rest of the team stare at him.  Kill the Meg?
 JONAS
 Even if rescue gets here for us, 
that doesn’t help the fishing 
boats, or the tourists.  Like it or 
not, we’re the ones responsible for 
this.  So I’m not going anywhere 
until that thing’s dead -- or I am. 
ON ZHANG - as he looks at Jonas.  And then nods.
 ZHANG
 What do have you in mind?
 JUMP FORWARD TO
 :
 EXT.  OCEAN SURFACE - AS SEEN FROM JUST UNDERWATER
 Peace, tranquility... THEN WE SEE SOMETHING FALLING TOWARDS 
US...  Is it TWO ASTRONAUTS IN SPACE SUITS...?
97.
 SPLASH!  --- No, it’s JONAS and SUYIN, each in DEEP-SEA 
DIVING SUITS, with WEIGHT BELTS that allow them to drop as 
fast sky divers, and RECOVERY WIRES hooked to their suits.
 GO BACK TO
 :
 EXT. MANA-ONE - MAIN PLATFORM 
Jonas begins to outline his plan.
 JONAS
 When you built this platform, you 
set the foundation in bedrock.  
Which means explosives.  Still have 
any?
 MAC 
We do, but they’re in an underwater 
bunker near the base of the 
station.  It’s 300 meters down.  
Jonas nods.  300 meters down.  That won’t be a problem...
 JONAS AND SUYIN’S POVS - FROM INSIDE THE SUITS
 JUMP FORWARD TO:
 We’re along for a TERRIFYING, TURBULENT, and CLAUSTROPHOBIC 
ride.  Outside sounds are muted - while our own breathing 
seems amplified.  OUR FIELD OF VIEW is limited to what’s 
directly in front of us.  We can just make out, to one side, 
the SUPERSTRUCTURE of the Mana-One as we drop down along it, 
rapidly.  Very rapidly
 .
 GO BACK TO
 :
 EXT. MANA-ONE - MAIN PLATFORM 
Jonas continues...
 JONAS
 This all started with the BOTs. The 
Meg was drawn to them as soon as 
you turned them on.  So Suyin and I 
will go down to that bunker.  We’ll 
get explosives and rig a bomb.  DJ, 
Fan, you two bring down a BOT.  
Then, we connect the bomb to the 
Bot, turn it on, and - 
FAN--Boom - end of story.
 JUMP FORWARD TO:
98.
 JONAS AND SUYIN’S POVS - FROM INSIDE THE SUITS
 The TERROR RIDE continues.  It’s like driving flat out 
through the fog, hoping you don’t hit something.  FISH AND 
AQUATIC LIFE rush up at us, seemingly out of nowhere!
 GO BACK TO:
 EXT. MANA-ONE - MAIN PLATFORM 
DJ shakes his head.  There’s a problem.
 DJ
 Jonas, that crane was our last 
chance of getting a BOT down there.  
The Meg already took out all our 
subs.  We’ve got nothing. 
Jonas is caught.  That’s a deal-breaker. 
FAN
 Actually there is something.
 An unmanned prototype Dimitri was 
working on.  It’s small, but 
powerful enough to take a Bot.
 DJ
 Since when was Dimitri interested 
in unmanned subs?
 FAN
 Since the day you tried to ask me 
out.
 That hangs there a beat.  All of them caught.  A moment of 
humanity.  Of levity at DJ’s expense.  They all needed that.  
MAC
 Okay people, let’s get to work!
 FORWARD TO
 :
 EXT. OCEAN - UNDERWATER 
JONAS and SUYIN whizz by, like two base jumpers, dropping 
along the Mana-One.  
BACK TO:
 EXT. MANA-1 - MAIN PLATFORM 
Everyone disperses to start the plan.  Jonas holds Mac back.  
99.
 JONAS
 None of this works if you don’t get 
power back to the main line.
 There’s a reason Jonas saved this for last.  It’s impossible.
 MAC
 Jonas, I don’t know if this Meg can 
read a blueprint, but she managed 
to take out all
 our generators.  
(shakes his head)
 Dimitri is who we need.
 JONAS
 You’re who we’ve got.
 Mac shakes his head. 
MAC
 I can’t tell if this plan is crazy, 
or stupid. 
JONAS
 Only one way to find out. 
Off their smiles...
 ON JONAS - INSIDE HIS SUIT - STILL IN FREE-FALL
 END SEQUENCE
 A matching smile on Jonas’s face as his breakneck descent 
continues.  A smile that EXPLODES INTO AGONY WHEN--SNAAAP!
 JONAS
 AAAARRRRRRRGGGGHHHHH!
 Jonas’s descent is STOPPED ABRUPTLY
 , causing him to cry out, 
as Suyin DISAPPEARS into the waters below.  
EXT. MANA-ONE - DECK 
Zhang, who is standing the TWO SPOOLS OF WIRE attached to 
their suits, sees Jonas’s wire has stopped dead.
 SUYIN (RADIO)
 SOMETHING HAPPENED TO JONAS!  
JONAS’S POV - FROM INSIDE HIS SUIT
 His breathing labored, Jonas shakes off the pain and looks 
up.  His LINE got SNAGGED on part of the MANA-ONE.
100.
 JONAS (MIC)
 I’m okay.  But my recovery line is 
all tangled up in the platform.
 SUYIN’S POV - RAPIDLY APPROACHING THE BOTTOM
 She’s at 300 meters and the sea floor is rushing towards her.
 SUYIN (MIC)
 Floor in sight,  Weight belt 
released...
 EXT. SEA-FLOOR (320 METERS) - CONTINUED
 Suyin hits the QUICK RELEASE ON HER WEIGHT BELT, freeing her 
from the dropping mass of lead.  The BELT continues on 
rapidly, STRIKING the sandy bottom like a meteor...
 But Suyin SLOWS RAPIDLY, and by the time she reaches the 
bottom, her momentum is dissipated by one forward roll.  She 
LOOKS UP for Jonas and sees him, dangling high up there, like 
some toy on a string, totally defenseless.  
EXT. OCEAN / INT. SUIT - JONAS’S POV
 Jonas begins to saw at the line his trusty knife. 
JONAS (MIC)
 I’m cutting free.
 ZHANG (RADIO)
 How do we get you back to the 
surface?
 JONAS (MIC)
 One problem at a time.  
At least this won’t take very long, the WIRE begins to fray 
quickly.  SNAP!... SNAP!... He’s free and begins to fall-- 
SUYIN (RADIO)--WAIT, JONAS DON’T!
 Reflexively, Jonas grabs for the wire and catches it.  But 
he’s holding his entire weight, and that of the belt, by one 
gloved hand.  And his grip is slipping, fast.
 SUYIN (RADIO)
 It’s passing right beneath you.
 JONAS LOOKS DOWN
 The MEG’s size, compared to Jonas’s, is almost comical.  It’s 
like a COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE is passing 10 feet beneath him.
101.
 JONAS LOOKS UP
 His GLOVED HAND can’t maintain a grip on the wire.  He 
watches the line slip from his fingers... And then... 
JONAS DROPS
 Just as the MEG finishes passing though!  WHOOOSH - it’s so 
close that JONAS can feel the heat of MEG’S massive tail as 
it swipes, lethally, just inches from him his face.
 EXT.  SEA-FLOOR (320 METERS) - MOMENTS LATER
 Suyin watches as Jonas approaches.  Like her, he ditches the 
weight belt with about 15 meters to go, then slows himself to 
make a soft landing.  Suyin stares at him.
 SUYIN
 You okay?
 JONAS
 Let’s get to the bunker.  Because I 
really want to blow that thing up.
 INT/EXT.  MANA ONE - POWER STATION - DAY
 CUT TO:
 The central power station is located one floor below the main 
deck, and the stairwell to it has collapsed, meaning MAC has 
to CRAWL down the twisted remains of the staircase...
 Then CRAWL across the top of the power station... Then REPEL 
off its side, dangling out over the water, so he can do the 
repairs there.  Mac looks down at a Medusa’s hair tangle of 
ELECTRICAL wires, half of which are hanging in the WATER.
 MAC
 What could go wrong here? 
As soon as he says that, WHAM! The MEG RAMS the station (off
screen) causing this ENTIRE PLATFORM TO DROP FIVE FEET CLOSER 
TO THE SEA before finally catching.  Mac’s adrenaline spikes.
 MAC
 (to the universe)
 That was a rhetorical question!
 WHAM!  The MEG hits the station again...
102.
 INT. MANA-ONE - EXTERNAL HALLWAY
 ...Rattling the entire Mana-one as the CAMERA now FOLLOWS 
BEHIND DJ AND FAN -- as they RUN down a partially-flooded 
industrial hallway, with only DJ’s FLASHLIGHT guiding them.
 DJ
 Is it me, or does it seem like 
she’s getting more pissed off?
 FAN
 She can join the club. 
DJ darts around a corner, FAN on his heels as...
 WHAM!  The MEG hits again and suddenly DAYLIGHT replaces 
darkness as the entire hallway in front of them DISAPPEARS
 !  
The MEG has taken out the SKYWAY connecting the north side of 
the Mana-One to the south side.  And it’s done that just as 
DJ was leading Fan onto that skyway at break-neck speed!
 DJ watches/feels as the corridor around him seems to vanish, 
and suddenly he’s in mid-air, about to drop into the lethal 
waters below.  For a moment, time stands still...
 Then a hand reaches into frame and-
FAN
 I GOT YOU!
 FAN pulls him back from certain death using every last bit of 
energy she’s got.  The two of them fall back into the safety 
of what’s left of the skyway.  For a moment, neither can do 
anything but breathe.
 Finally, they get to their feet.  And DJ looks straight into 
the eyes of the woman who just saved his life.
 DJ
 Just so we’re clear, I wasn’t 
asking you out.  I was being polite 
because you were new here. 
Fan stares at him.  About to nail him with a clever rejoinder 
when -- WOOOOSH -- DJ vanishes
 .  FALLING into the ocean as 
more of the skyway collapses.  Fan can only watch him go... 
EXT. FROM BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN - CONTINUED
 Through the churning water, we see DJ falling backwards into 
the sea.  His IMPACT SPLASH rings out like a dinner bell. 
103.
 EXT. OCEAN - CONTINUED
 DJ surfaces and finds himself surrounded by large chunks of 
floating DEBRIS.  He looks for something big enough to 
protect him from the shark, but then realizes that’s futile. 
So he looks up at the Mana-One.  He has NO WAY of climbing 
back up on the South side, where Fan is.  His only choice is 
to swim the 50 meters the skyway used to span and reach the 
North Side, where the DIVE PLATFORM sits at just above water 
level.  A safe haven.  If he can get there.
 DJ is about to swim for it when-
FAN (O.S.)
 DJ.  Don’t.  Move.  
.
 He looks up at Fan.  He’s never seen her so scared in her 
life
 EXT. MANA-ONE - FAN’S POV
 Now we see why.  THE MEG is just a few meters beneath the 
surface of the water, DIRECTLY UNDER DJ, studying him.
 ON DJ - as he begins to hyperventilate from fear.  He has to 
fight the urge to move.  An urge coming from every cell in 
his body.
 ON FAN - she stares directly into his eyes, trying to keep 
him centered.  Keep looking at me.  Relax.  Just relax. 
ON DJ - trying not to cry out as the MEG’S MASSIVE NOSE 
lazily brushes him.  As if to see - is this just a piece of 
debris, or should I eat it...?
 FAN
 You’re OK.  You’re Ok.
 DJ looks up at her - easy for her to say!  Then suddenly DJ 
is BLINDED BY A BEAM OF LIGHT.  What the?!
 It’s his flashlight
 .  The nudge from the Meg liberated it 
from DJ’s pocket, it’s about to fall in the water, and it’s 
still on!  
DJ
 Oh no...
 ON THE FLASHLIGHT as it leaves the confines of DJ’s pocket 
and begins to sink.  DJ knows if he grabs for it, the MEG 
will devour him.  So he remains motionless.  Helpless to stop 
the flashlight’s fall.
104.
 EXT. BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN
 The flashlight TUMBLES end over end - down past the massive 
creature - which takes no notice of such a tiny spec. 
But then, like an undersea spotlight, the flashlight’s beam 
sweeps the eyes of the MEG, before disappearing below.
 The MEG, triggered, follows it into the depths.
 EXT. OCEAN - CONTINUED
 As DJ waits for death, FAN realizes the MEG has vanished.  
But where is it...? 
WHAM!  The answer nearly sends Fan into the ocean herself.  
The MEG has moved off, and decided to strike one of the TWO 
ZODIACS tied up at the dock.  It takes half the dock with it!
 The bad news is - with the dock damaged - that part of the 
station begins to take on water.  The good news is - all that 
is happening a good distance away from where DJ is!
 FAN
 DJ! Go! Go!
 DJ, amazed to still be alive, SWIMS as fast as he can...
 EXT. OCEAN - MANA-ONE - CONTINUED
 DJ manages only a few strokes BEFORE THE MEG’S DORSAL FIN 
STOPS in the water, like it just figured out it’s been duped.
 It violently spins around and heads straight for DJ, cutting 
through the ocean like a Miter saw.  
EXT. OCEAN - SURFACE LEVEL
 WIDER - on DJ as he pushes forward.  Over his shoulder, we 
begin to see the massive dorsal fin, rising into frame as it 
gets closer.   If DJ looks back, he’s dead. 
EXT. OCEAN - BELOW SURFACE
 A TRAILER SHOT - The tiny silhouette of the man... And the 
incredible scale of the monster that’s about to catch him.
 EXT. OCEAN SURFACE
 CLOSE ON DJ - Head down.  Desperate.
 CLOSE ON THE MEG - mouth opening wide for feeding...
105.
 INT./EXT. LOADING DOCK - SOUTH SIDE OF MANA ONE
 In one fluid motion, DJ swings himself up onto the deck, then 
rolls as far away from the water as he can get so when -- 
SLAM -- THE MEG RAMS THE SIDE OF THE LOADING AREA -- he 
remains safely out of reach.
 EXT. MAIN PLATFORM - NORTH SIDE OF MANA ONE
 Fan lets a scram of celebration.  He made it.  He made it!! 
INT./EXT. LOADING DOCK - SOUTH SIDE OF MANA ONE
 DJ, lying flat on his back, speaks to Fan via his ear
piece/mic.
 DJ (MIC)
 You might want to take the stairs.
 CUT TO:
 INT. STORAGE FACILITY - 3OO METERS BELOW THE SURFACE - DAY
 CLOSE ON - A PAIR OF HANDS - as they stack small SEMTEX 
PLASTIQUE (explosive) BRICKS into the shape of a Mayan 
pyramid.  
CLOSE ON - THE SAME HANDS - now securing the pyramid with 
strategic strips of duct tape.
 CLOSE ON - THE SAME HANDS - as they connect a small IMPACT 
PLATE TO THE TOP of the creation.
 PULL BACK TO REVEAL - Suyin watching Jonas finish his work.
 JONAS
 (off her look)
 My ex-wife always said I was good 
at blowing things up. 
Jonas and Suyin load the bomb into a BACKPACK.  Bomb safely 
inside, Jonas zips up the pack before Suyin carefully puts it 
on his back.  She waits for him to start walking. 
JONAS
 (I have a bomb on my back)
 You should go in front of me.  
Suyin nods, good point.  As she starts for the Air-Lock, 
SOMETHING ON THE SUPPLY SHELF catches Jonas’s eye.  
Hand Flares
 .  He thinks a moment.  Then takes two. 
106.
 JONAS (MIC)
 How’s it going up there, Mac?
 INT/EXT.  MANA ONE - POWER STATION - DAY
 MAC’S SWEAT DRENCHED EYES focus on the breaker panel with 
eager anticipation.  He slams down the central switch 
and...BOOM
 !!!  An explosion of sparks sends him reeling and 
almost off the edge of the power station.  He’s blown the 
fuse board. 
MAC (MIC)
 Oh, it’s going great.  
He opens up the BOARD and begins to remove a fuse with his 
FINGERS...
 INT. DIVE PLATFORM - DAY
 While FAN’S FINGERS FLY across the keys of a LAPTOP. 
ON SCREEN we see: RSV-NAVIGATION CONTROLS - LINKING... 
LINKING... CONNECTED
 .
 BEGIN POWER UP SEQUENCE...
 Machine-sounds begin to fill the air behind Fan.  Their 
source, THE UNMANNED SUBMERSIBLE, comes into view as DJ 
brings it out of Dimitri’s lab, pulling it along an overhead 
conveyor belt.
 FAN (MIC)
 Jonas, we’re one minute to launch.
 EXT. SEA-FLOOR - STORAGE FACILITY - CONTINUED
 Jonas and Suyin, just visible in the gloaming, walk clear of 
the storage facility and look up at the DARK MANA-ONE.  
FAN (RADIO)
 Camera range is limited.  So you’ll 
have to guide me when I get close.
 INT  MANA ONE - POWER CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUED
 Mac is now at the main control board for the entire power 
station.  FLIP - FLIP - FLIP... He powers up the Main Bus, 
and for a moment it looks like it will work until
BOOM!  Again.  Something goes wrong.  This time forcing MAC 
to duck down for cover UNDER THE DESK.  
107.
 While down there he sees an OPEN DRAWER.  In it, is a small 
box labeled, “in case of emergency”.  He opens the box and 
finds a bottle of 1942 Don Julio tequila.  He stares at it.  
FAN (RADIO)
 RSV launched...
 INT. DIVE PLATFORM - VIEW FROM UNDERWATER 
THE UNMANNED SUB descends RIGHT AT US... It passes by 
CAMERA... It’s TOW-LINE growing taut...
 INT. DIVE PLATFORM - CONTINUED
 DJ watches as a BOT now follows the sub into the depths 
below.  Next to him, FAN works the sub’s controls, which are 
linked to a LAPTOP that gives her a view from its NOSE CAM.
 FAN (MIC)
 Bot clear and coming down to you.
 EXT. SEA-FLOOR - STORAGE FACILITY - CONTINUED
 Jonas and Suyin, standing there like decorations in an 
aquarium, exposed and doing their best to stay motionless...
 SUYIN (MIC)
 Any sign of our friend?
 EXT. MANA-ONE - DIVE PLATFORM - DAY
 Zhang scans the water around the platform.  
ZHANG (MIC)
 She’s not up here.
 INT. DIVE PLATFORM - CONTINUED
 CLOSE ON THE MONITOR - showing the way ahead for the 
submersible.  
CLOSE ON FAN’S THUMBS - as she adjusts for currents.
 CLOSE ON THE DEPTH READ-OUT - now clicking past 150 meters.
 EXT.  SEA-FLOOR - CONTINUED
 Like tumbleweeds blowing across a ghost town at high-noon, 
STRANGE CLUMPS of PLANT LIFE roll by JONAS and SUYIN’S FEET. 
FAN (RADIO - STATIC)
 That’s 150.  You should see it any 
second now...
108.
 JONAS AND SUYIN - STRAINING THEIR EYES to look above them.  
But it’s nearly impossible with the MANA-ONE still dark.
 INT  MANA ONE - POWER CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUED
 CLOSE ON - MAC - as finishes a re-patch and, with an exhale, 
POWERS IT UP.   
FLIP - FLIP - FLIP...  Before he throws the 
final switch he takes a ceremonial ‘good luck’ sip of the 
tequila, puts the bottle down and then.... FLIP...
 No explosion...  No boom....
 Just a SERIES of GREEN LIGHTS COMING ON
 .
 INT. DIVE CONTROL CENTER 
All the power comes back on in the abandoned DCC.  We watch 
as the INTERNAL PRESSURE GAUGES return to NORMAL.
 EXT. MANA-ONE 
External lights go on.  Zhang smiles at Meiying.  Good news. 
EXT. SEA-FLOOR - CONTINUED
 Jonas and Suyin watch as the MANA-ONE blossoms to life.  It’s 
like being at the foot of the Eifel tower at night.
 And thanks to the light they can now see the SUBMERSIBLE AND 
THE BOT - high above them - but making progress.
 JONAS (MIC)
 RSV in sight...
 But his voice TRAILS OFF because suddenly the SUB and the BOT 
vanishes in A SHADOW.
 INT. DIVE PLATFORM  - CONTINUED
 PFFFFFT! - STATIC replaces the picture from submersible’s 
nose cam.  The RSV stops responding to controls...
 FAN
 What the...?
 EXT. SEA-FLOOR - CONTINUED
 Gradually, the shadow clears... And suddenly Jonas and Suyin 
are looking at THE BOT -- no longer tethered to anything -- 
dropping like a ROCK -- right down on top of them!
 JONAS (MIC)
 LOOK OUT!
109.
 JONAS pushes SUYIN to cover behind rocky coral as -- SMASH-- 
THE BOT slams into the sea-floor, sending debris flying. 
For a minute, we can’t see anything through the all the SAND 
that’s been kicked up by impact.
 ZHANG (RADIO)
 Jonas, come in!  Jonas, Suyin!
 Then the SAND clears.  Jonas and Suyin are okay.  But their 
plan literally lies in tatters all around their feet.
 JONAS (MIC)
 Fan, this is the moment you tell me 
Dimitri made two of those things.
 INT. DIVE PLATFORM - CONTINUED
 Fan stares at her controls, still trying to re-establish 
contact with the machine.   DJ puts his hand on her shoulder.
 DJ (MIC)
 That’s a negative, Jonas.
 EXT. MANA-ONE - DAY
 Mac, who has joined Zhang and Meiying, looks at Zhang.
 MAC
 (in disbelief)
 There has to be another way.
 EXT.  SEA-FLOOR - CONTINUED
 Jonas has another way.  He exhales.
 JONAS (MIC)
 Okay, then.  DJ and Fan get to the 
Zodiac.  As soon as Suyin surfaces, 
you load up and get as far away 
from here as you can.
 SUYIN (MIC)
 What are you doing?
 Jonas shows her the hand flares.
 JONAS (MIC)
 Back-up plan.  I use these to lure 
it to the O-level, we know how much 
it likes smashing that place up.
 SUYIN (MIC)
 That’s a suicide mission.
110.
 JONAS (MIC)
 Not necessarily. It is, however, a 
solo mission so... Dr. Zhang, 
you’re clear to bring Suyin up...
 SUYIN (MIC)
 No...
 EXT. MANA-ONE - DAY
 DJ and Fan have joined Mac, Zhang, and Meiying.
 JONAS (RADIO)
 Dr. Zhang, I repeat, bring Suyin 
up...
 ZHANG (MIC)
 Jonas, let’s think a moment-
JONAS (RADIO)
 Dammit, it’s this or we all
 lose.  
Now bring your daughter back to her 
daughter, am I clear?
 EXT.  SEA-FLOOR - CONTINUED
 Suyin shakes her head.
 SUYIN (MIC)
 No, we’re in this together...
 She reaches out with a tether hook - hoping to connect 
Jonas’s suit to hers but just before she can...
 She is pulled away
 .  She’s being pulled up.
 EXT. MANA-ONE - DAY
 Mac has thrown the lever himself.
 SUYIN (MIC)
 I’m cutting loose!
 EXT. SEA-FLOOR - CONTINUED
 She can still see Jonas - he looks at her.
 JONAS (MIC)
 Please don’t.
 The distance between them growing... The flickering lights of 
the Mana-One revealing the sadness in Suyin’s eyes...
 Then she disappears into the haze.
111.
 EXT.  MANA-ONE - 320 METERS DOWN
 Jonas approaches an emergency airlock at the base.  He 
touches the keypad.  It lights up.
 JONAS (MIC)
 Mac.  I forgot to say - great job 
with the power.  Not that I ever 
doubted you.
 EXT. MANA-ONE - DOCK - DAY
 Mac smiles at the joke.  Behind him, the group cautiously 
boards the lone Zodiac tied to what’s left of the dock.
 JONAS (RADIO)
 Okay, maybe I did...
 MAC (MIC)
 So, a back-up plan, huh?
 INT. MANA-ONE - EMERGENCY STAIRWELL - SAME
 Jonas, free from his suit, climbs a seemingly endless ladder, 
backpack still on.
 INT. MANA-ONE - THE O-LEVEL - CONTINUED
 Jonas emerges from a hatch on the backside of the Elevator 
shaft.  He walks around so he can see ALL THREE REMAINING 
SPOKES - AND THE RIM THAT IS ATTACHED TO THEM ALL.
 JONAS (MIC)
 You just be ready to get out of 
here when I tell you.
 He presses the elevator button.  Waits and then - ding.  It 
arrives.  He steps inside, presses the button for the 
surface, then WEDGES the door so it doesn’t go anywhere.
 THEN JONAS TURNS AND WALKS DOWN THE CENTER SPOKE
 He’s heading towards the rim, appreciating the magnificent 
structure this used to be.
 JONAS (MIC)
 Dr. Zhang, I don’t know what kind 
of security deposit you put down on 
this place, but I don’t think 
you’re getting it back. 
ZHANG (RADIO)
 Whatever it takes, Jonas.... 
112.
 EXT. MANA-ONE - DOCK
 FAN unties the bow, ZHANG the stern.  Everyone is on board, 
including -- SUYIN, who surprises Jonas when she chimes in:
 SUYIN (MIC)
 Just make sure you get back up 
here.
 INT.  MANA-ONE - THE O-LEVEL - CONTINUED
 Jonas, pleased Suyin has said this.  Happy to hear her voice.
 JONAS (MIC)
 Okay... Thirty seconds.
 EXT.  MANA-ONE - DOCK - CONTINUED
 The ZODIAC’s engine roars to life.
 EXT.  300 METERS DOWN - THE OCEAN - SAME
 The noise of the ZODIAC is more of a low vibration down 
here...  One the MEG turns towards...
 It begins its ascent but then...
 TWINKLING RED-LIGHTS catch its attention.
 It’s Jonas... In the O-Level...
 JONAS (V.O - RADIO)
 Twenty seconds...
 INT.  MANA-ONE - THE O-LEVEL - CONTINUED
 Jonas has struck the two flares and he’s waving them in his 
hands... Waiting... Hoping to see the MEG coming for him.
 JONAS
 Come on... Come on...
 The MEG turns -- and comes straight towards him
 .  JONAS holds 
his ground... And holds it... And holds it... Then-
JONAS (MIC) 
Ten seconds.  Go!
 Jonas tosses the flares so that they will land close to the 
backpack.  As they arc high in the air, he turns and sprints 
FOR THE ELEVATOR...
113.
 EXT. OCEAN - CONTINUED
 The ZODIAC puts some distance between itself and the station.
 JONAS (RADIO)
 Five seconds...  Four...
 INT. ELEVATOR - SAME
 Jonas runs into the Elevator and pulls out the wedge.  The 
doors close, and the ELEVATOR QUICKLY BEGINS TO RISE.
 JONAS (MIC)
 (smiling)
 ...Three... two...
 THAT’S WHEN ALL THE POWER GOES OUT - INCLUDING THE POWER FOR 
THE ELEVATOR - BRINGING EVERYTHING TO A GRINDING HALT.
 So much for his escape
 .  
EXT. OCEAN - ZODIAC - SAME
 The passengers see the station power down.  Grim reality sets 
in.  They know that can’t be good for his plan.
 INT. ELEVATOR - SAME
 For a moment Jonas just sits there in the darkness.  Then he 
sees something. Gum.  He stakes a stick as he finishes the 
countdown-
JONAS--One
 .  
INT. MANA-ONE - THE O-LEVEL - SAME
 SMASH
 .  The glass of the center spoke gives way to the power 
of the MEG.  And the MEG plows right into the backpack.
 BLAM! 
An explosive force of more than a 1000 sticks of dynamite is 
released.
 FROM SEVERAL ANGLES - INSIDE AND OUTSIDE
 The MEG dies in three stages that play out in less than 
1/100th of a second.  First, the BLAST WAVE liquefies the 
cartilage that makes up its body, essentially turning into a 
giant shark-suited goo.  Then, the HEAT super cooks the skin 
into a black charcoal.  Finally, the glass shards pierce the 
carcass, VAPORIZING it into a cloud of tissue and blood that 
leaves no mistake - THE MEG IS NO MORE.
114.
 INT. ELEVATOR - SAME
 The explosion, moving faster than sound, hits the elevator 
BEFORE the sound does.  So for a dizzying moment, the 
elevator is rocketed skyward, a bullet in a silent barrel.  
THEN COMES THE DEAFENING ROAR
 A JET OF FIRE - shoots through the seams of the rapidly 
rising rocket lift.  Suddenly Jonas thinks it’s walls are 
made of flame.  Then FLAMES obscure our view of him.
 EXT. OCEAN - CONTINUED
 From the Zodiac, the Mana-One looks like a volcano.  JETS OF 
FIRE erupt randomly from the station, followed by a DEAFENING 
BLAST that causes the team to duck and cover. 
INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUED
 Still shooting towards the surface, flames swirling.  Then, 
when the pressure has reached its crescendo, THE ELEVATOR 
ITSELF DISINTEGRATES, and, like a cocoon that’s revealed its 
cargo, it releases Jonas into the OCEAN.
 Floating in and out of consciousness, rising towards the 
light, the last thing JONAS sees is a hazy image of THE BABY 
HUMPBACK WHALE.  It’s safe.  Then he passes out and we...
 FADE TO BLACK
 :
 EXT. OCEAN - DAY
 The Zodiac navigates the seas around what’s left of the Mana
One. They’ve been searching for ten minutes with no sign.  
Expressions are grave.
 It’s Suyin who sees him.
 SUYIN
 There! 
JONAS is lying, half in the water, half clinging to a 
floating remnant of the Mana-One.  But he’s not moving.  The 
crew agonizes, waiting for a sign...  They get it when Jonas, 
without raising his head, lifts a weary arm skyward and gives 
them a THUMBS UP.
 EXT.  OUTDOOR PLAZA - DIVE CENTER AT TIANJIN - DAY
 CUT TO:
 A reverent crowd sits, listening to the end of a MEMORIAL 
SERVICE/CELEBRATION OF LIFE.  SUYIN stands at a dais, in 
115.
 front of the MEMORIAL ITSELF, a beautiful, white marble, free
standing wall that is shaped like a WAVE.  On the wall, 
etched tastefully, as if they were part of the wave, are the 
names and histories of Junjie, Carl, Luc, Francois, Heller, 
and Dimitri. 
SUYIN, stunningly beautiful in her formal dress, turns to the 
final page of her dedication speech.
 SUYIN
 (at the dais)
 Advancing our understanding of life 
has always required great 
sacrifice.  The world doesn’t give 
up her secrets easily...
 OFF TO THE SIDE
 JONAS, dashing in a suit.  MAC, a little less so in his.  FAN 
and DJ both looking cooler than everyone else in the place.  
ZHANG watches Suyin with great admiration.
 MAC
 (quietly to Jonas)
 She’s her father’s daughter all 
right.
 SUYIN
 (at the dais)
 My father’s dream, a dream shared 
by those we honor today, is that we 
come to appreciate the gift that is 
our oceans.  Now, thanks to their 
efforts, the entire world knows 
that there is more to this gift 
than we dared imagine.   And I see, 
in everyone’s eyes, the same 
excitement I once saw exclusively 
in my father’s.  That is how I know 
the friends we lost will live 
forever.
 (it hangs there)
 Thank you all very much.
 Off the applause we CUT TO...
 EXT.  OUTDOOR PLAZA - DIVE CENTER AT TIANJIN - A LITTLE LATER
 People milling about, congratulating Suyin who is with Zhang, 
Meiying, Jonas, and Mac.  A passing waiter offers some crab 
cakes...  Jonas shakes his head...
 MEIYING
 He’s allergic.
116.
 Mac takes a beat.
 MAC
 You are?  Is that ironic?
 (as they laugh)
 And since when does Meiying know 
stuff about you that I don’t...
 Mac’s voice trails off as he realizes Jonas and Suyin are 
TOGETHER. 
MAC (CONT’D)
 Oh, uh, never mind-
MEIYING
 Try to keep up, Mac.  
That gets laughs.  Mac is in the middle of a comeback when a 
US and a CHINESE NAVAL OFFICER interrupt the festivities.
 CHINESE OFFICER
 Excuse me, Dr. Zhang, we have a 
situation and we’d like to talk to 
you.  
ZHANG
