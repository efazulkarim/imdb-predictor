 EXT. MEDIEVAL VILLAGE - JUST BEFORE SUNSET
 We see an Italian village at the height of the plague.  
Funeral processions, decrepit houses with their windows 
boarded up... the stench of death all around.
 TITLE:  EUROPE. THE DARK AGES
 1
 2
 Through the filth a KNIGHT walks his horse.  He is weary but 
not so dingy as his surrounding; a stranger in these parts. 
He comes to an inn, where a boy takes his horse round back. 
He enters the inn.
 INT. INN - SAME TIME
 3
 The inn is dark and almost empty.  A couple of patrons drink 
silently at tables.  Behind the bar stands a slovenly 
BARMAID, dark-haired and lazy.  She scratches at her 
shoulder, on which we see a birthmark.  The knight 
approaches the bar, throws money down.
 KNIGHT
 A tankard of ale, wench.
 The barmaid pours him a cup of ale.  He drinks deep, stands 
a moment.
 KNIGHT (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 Some plague we're having, huh?
 INT. INN - UPSTAIRS HALL/BEDROOM - NIGHT
 CUT TO:
 The barmaid leads the knight, by candlelight, upstairs to 
4
 his room.  The door opens inward.  The knight stands in the 
doorway, places a hand on the barmaid's hip.  She pauses a 
moment, then breaks free of his grasp, starts down the hall.  
He laughs a bit, resignedly, and closes the door.
 A VAMPIRE stands behind it.  Not two feet from the knight, 
grinning at him.  His eyes are skull-hollow and dancing in 
his head, his bloody smile full with teeth.  His skin is 
gray, and peeling.  The knight turns slowly and sees him.
 KNIGHT
 Oh, my god...
 The vampire licks his lips.
2.
 He is on the knight in a second, pushing him backwards into 
the middle of the small room.  The knight struggles but is 
no match for the vampire, who buries his face in the 
knight's neck.  The knight screams.

 ANGLE ON DOOR
 It suddenly flies open, the lock shattered.
 5
 The vampire turns like a frightened animal.  In the doorway 
stands the barmaid, a SLAYER.  In her hand is a wooden 
stake.
 The vampire drops the knight, who crabs backwards into a 
corner. The Slayer and the vampire come at each other.  The 
Slayer spins and kicks; the vampire flies back.  Snarling, 
he comes back at the slayer.  They struggle; he slips free 
and is out the door.
 For a moment, the Slayer remains still, crouched on the 
floor. The knight watches her.  She seems to be making a 
decision -- perhaps even knows what is going to happen.
 She runs at the window.
 EXT. IN FRONT OF THE INN - SAME TIME
 CUT TO:
 6
 The vampire comes running out the front door.  Before he is 
a few feet from the front of the inn, the Slayer SMASHES 
through the upstairs window and lands on him.  They both hit 
the ground, and she plants the stake right in his heart.
 After a moment, we hear a voice:
 AMILYN (O.S.)
 The lord giveth, and the lord 
taketh away.  Ashes, ashes...
 She looks up.
 AMILYN (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 ... All fall down
 There are ten or more vampires walking slowly toward her in 
the otherwise deserted street.  At the front, maybe ten feet 
away, is AMILYN.
 Amilyn is a grinning jackal, a servant to the Vampire-King. 
His garb is a rotted approximation of a courtier's livery.  
He ambles toward the Slayer, giggling, as she stands.
3.
 Behind her is LOTHOS, the Vampire-King.  His skin is deep 
white, and smooth.  He wears a long coat -- his dress is not 
of any era.  He is practically upon her before he speaks.
 LOTHOS
 You must forgive Amilyn.  He tends 
to drool before supper.
 She turns.  He smiles, almost lovingly.
 SLAYER
 Lothos...
 LOTHOS
 You people will never learn.
 She swings at him but he grabs her arm.  Amilyn laughs 
obnoxiously.  Lothos grabs the back of the Slayer's head, 
brings her to him in a loving embrace.
 LOTHOS (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 We can't be stopped.  This is our 
world now.
 He pulls her head back swiftly, snapping her spine as her 
head hits the back of her legs.  Lightning flashes.

 INT. ENGLISH CASTLE - NIGHT
 CUT TO:
 7
 Lightning flashes outside the window.  It is torrenting 
rain. An old MAN speaks to a hysterical GIRL of sixteen or 
so.  They are both obviously noble of birth.
 GIRL
 I can't!
 MAN
 You know you must.  There is only 
one.  Now you are that one.  It is 
time.
 GIRL
 Why?  Why me?
 MAN
 She has died.  You are the next to 
be called.  Why do you think you 
were sent to me?  Trained as you 
were?  You bear the mark.
4.
 He pulls aside her blouse to reveal a birthmark on her 
shoulder, identical to the barmaid's.
 MAN (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 The mark of the Coven.
 GIRL
 I don't understand.
 MAN
 Ever since Adam and Eve first left 
the garden, he followed: the 
serpent. Satan.  He sends his 
legion in the shape of men, to feed 
on us, to breed his Hell on our 
earth.  They are a plague upon us.
 The man unravels a satchel of cloth.  From it he pulls an 
elaborately carved wooden stake.
 MAN (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 But as long as there have been 
vampire, there has been the Coven; 
the line of Slayers.  Ones with the 
strength and the skill to kill 
them, to find them where they 
gather and stop the swell of their 
numbers. One dies, the next is 
called.
 GIRL
 I'm just a girl.
 MAN
 You are much more.
 He hands her the stake.  She feels the fit.
 MAN (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 One dies, the next is called...
 As she grips the stake more tightly, an awareness and sense 
of power sees to fill her.  She lifts the stake over her 
head.

 CLOSEUP - A HAND

 The hand is lifted high, but it is not the girl's.  It holds 
not a stake, but a pom-pom.

 EXT. HEMERY HIGH FOOTBALL FIELD - WIDER SHOT - DAY
 Opening CREDITS OVER:
 A football game in progress.  The stands are pretty full, 
the crowd enthusiastic.  The hemery football stadium is just 
that; a real stadium, not just makeshift stands on grass.
 On  the sidelines are the Hemery cheerleaders, led by BUFFY. 
She is blonde (in nature as in name), pretty, and very 
gracefully athletic.  She obviously enjoys what she is 
doing, and she's good at it.
 With her on the squad are JENNIFER and NICOLE, two of her 
best friends.  Beside them the COACH, yelling at the 
players.  The scoreboard reads HEMERY VS. SETON.
 On the field are JEFFREY, wide receiver (and Buffy's 
boyfriend), ANDY, quarterback, and GRUELLER, the huge left 
tackle.
 Buffy and the crowd wince as Andy is sacked for a nine-yard 
loss.
 COACH
 Come on, do the play!  The one 
where...  the one from the book! 
Where you make it go forward!
 The players huddle.
 ANDY
 All right, guys, come on!
 He hits Grueller's helmet.
 ANDY (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 Grueller!  Fill that hole!  They 
were all over me!  Okay.  Let's run 
twenty-two.  Grueller, close the 
pocket, watch out for thirty-five. 
Thompson, run the post, right, wide 
out.  Jeffrey, go up the middle and 
run around like a chicken.
 They clap and break.  As they line up, Jeffrey looks over at 
Buffy.  She smiles at him.  He winks, very suave.
 BUFFY AND CHEERLEADERS
 Jeffrey!  Jeffrey! He's our man!
 If he can't do it We don't want it!
6.
 On the hike, Andy drops back and looks for a receiver.  
Jeffrey runs in circles like an idiot (and not unlike a 
chicken), waving his arms until Andy sails him the ball and 
he breaks for a touchdown.
 The crowd goes wild -- particularly Buffy, who does an 
impressive standing backflip.  Nicole looks at her, 
impressed. Buffy smiles at her, giddy.
 COACH
 (looking around)
 Is that good?  Was that a good 
thing?

 INT. THE MALL - AFTERNOON
 CUT TO:
 10
 The mall is typically busy.  Buffy, Nicole, Jennifer and 
KIMBERLY can bee seen making their way through it.  They are 
all dressed very similarly:  bright colors, a lot of white 
and pink.  Not trashy, but mainstream and uninspired.  
Esprit. All of them carry shopping bags; they've done a good 
days work.
 11
 TITLE:  CALIFORNIA. THE LITE AGES
 The girls pass by stores, vaguely window shopping.
 BUFFY
 Mr. Howard is so heinous.  He's 
always giving me a hard time.  I 
get a C-plus on the test and he 
tells me, 'You have no sense of 
history.'  I have no sense of 
history?  He wears a brown tie.
 NICOLE
 You got a C-plus?  I can't believe 
I cheated off you.
 BUFFY
 Excuse me for not knowing about El 
Salvador.  Like I'm ever going to 
Spain anyway.  Ooh!
 11
 A dress on a rack outside a store has caught her eye.  She 
takes it and holds it in front of her.
 BUFFY (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 Mmmm.  Wouldn't I look just edible 
and nutritious in this?
Kimberly and Jennifer catch up to them.
 7.
 KIMBERLY
 Guys, what's the sitch?  I'm bored.
 BUFFY
 (modeling the dress for 
Kimberly))
 What do you think?
 KIMBERLY
 Please.  It's so '91.
 GIRL
 Oh.
 Buffy puts it back.
 KIMBERLY
 What are we doing?
 BUFFY
 Why don't we see a movie?
 KIMBERLY
 Well, where?
 JENNIFER
 Omniplex?
 NICOLE
 Nee sitch.  No way.
 BUFFY
 No THX.
 NICOLE
 They don't even have Dolby.
 KIMBERLY
 Beverly Center.
 BUFFY
 Please.  They show previews for 
foreign movies.
 NICOLE
 AMC?
 KIMBERLY/BUFFY
 Bogus corn!
8.
 KIMBERLY
 Totally stale.  And the ushers are 
like, the acne patrol.  We're 
thinking Pavilion.  Sitch?
 BUFFY
 Sounds toasty.  We're going 
Pavilion.
 JENNIFER
 Excellent.
 BUFFY
 What's playing there?
 A stranger, walking the other way, bumps into Buffy, doesn't 
stop.  A man of about fifty, he is dressed shabbily, in a 
wrinkled black suit and a black shirt.  He somewhat 
resembles a priest.
 BUFFY (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 Excuse much!  Not rude or anything.
 KIMBERLY
 (calling back)
 Nice ensemble!
 NICOLE
 What a homeless.
 The girls continue walking.  The man stops, turns to stare 
after them.  His look is intense, slightly worried, his face 
somewhat haggard.  Intelligence shines through his eyes.  He 
holds himself stiffly, arms close to him, almost as if he 
expected something to strike at him.
 This is MERRICK.  He pulls a picture out of his coat pocket, 
looks at it.  Looks at them.
 12
 INT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY
 12
 The film is in progress.  This has no effect on the girls, 
however, as they continue to talk ceaselessly.  They all 
have diet sodas.
 NICOLE
 (to Buffy)
 So, is Jeffrey really spending the 
night at your house?
 BUFFY
 That's the plan.
9.
 NICOLE
 Good enough!
 JENNIFER
 Your parents are always going away 
for the weekend.  You're so lucky.
 BUFFY
 (maybe not)
 Yeah, I guess.
 JENNIFER
 My mom doesn't go anywhere.  She 
even does the shopping network. I'm 
gonna die a virgin.
 KIMBERLY
 What did Jeffrey's dad say?
 BUFFY
 'Just remember you're in training, 
son'
 NICOLE
 Oh, God.
 KIMBERLY
 He is so bald.
 Seated a few rows behind the girls are PIKE and BENNY.  The 
are fairly punked out, (and not currently attending high 
school).  Pike is long and lean, has short hair spiked and a 
taste for long coats and black.  Benny is somewhat stockier, 
opts for a shaved head and suspenders.  Doc Martins for 
both. Benny is clearly the more belligerent of the two -- 
when Pike speaks, it's with surprising wit and reserve.  
Sometimes.
 PIKE
 Will you guys shut up, please?
 BUFFY
 It could happen.
 Pike and Benny throw popcorn at her.
 PIKE
 Booo!
 Suck!
 BENNY
 PIKE
 Wrong answer!  No prize.
10.
 NICOLE
 God!  Take a chill lozenge.
 KIMBERLY
 Like we don't have rights too?
 BUFFY
 Ignore them.
 BENNY
 I can't believe these people.  We 
paid money to see this.
 PIKE
 No, we didn't.
 BENNY
 Oh, yeah.  But I still want to know 
what happens.
 BUFFY
 Everyone get horribly killed except 
the blonde girl in the nightie, who 
finally kills the monster with a 
machete but it's not really dead.
 The boys stare at her.
 JENNIFER
 Oh, my God.  Is that true?
 BUFFY
 Probably.  What movie is this?

 ANGLE - THE MOON
 CUT TO:
 Fat and yellow, behind the clouds.  We hear a long HOWL.

 EXT. THE MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

 Jeffrey pulls into the parking lot in his BMW convertible. 
Grueller, howling, sits in the back behind Jeffrey and Andy. 
They park and hop out, head toward the entrance.
 GRUELLER
 Look at that moon!  It's huge! Come 
on, guys, we gotta do something 
tonight.  Party.
11.
 ANDY
 You know, if you would spend more 
time at home sleeping, you would 
spend less time on the field, 
sucking.
 JEFFREY
 You were a bone out there today. 
Anyway, I'm booked.  Gonna spend 
some quality time with the little 
woman.
 ANDY AND GRUELLER
 (coughing it into their 
hands)
 Pussy-whipped.  Pussy-whipped.
 JEFFREY
 You guys are pathetic.
 GRUELLER
 Later for you, then.  I'm blowing. 
Andy, you coming?
 ANDY
 No, I'll hitch a ride with Jeffrey.
 GRUELLER
 Okay.  Later.
 ANDY
 Headbutt!
 Andy and Grueller bring their foreheads together with 
painstaking slowness, grimacing, and barely tap heads.
 ANDY (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 Later.
 Grueller walks off, head through a park.
 At the same time, Pike and Benny emerge from the theater. 
They pass Andy and Jeffrey and the two pairs circle each 
other, almost growling, eyes locked, before pike and Benny 
turn and walk off, not quite in the direction Grueller took.  
Buffy, Kimberly, Jennifer and Nicole come out right after.  
Buffy heads straight for Jeffrey and they kiss massively.
 BUFFY
 Nice game.
12.
 ANDY
 Jeffrey, I don't mean to sound 
sexist or anything, but can I 
borrow her?
 BUFFY
 Andy!
 JEFFREY
 No way.  You'd get her dirty.
 (off her look)
 He would, honey.  He's an animal.
 15
 EXT. THE PARK - SAME TIME
 CUT TO:
 15
 Grueller walks through the trees, enters an enclosed 
clearing of grass.  He hears something, stops.  Maybe his 
name, maybe just the BUSHES RUSTLING.  He looks about him, 
hesitantly. Starts forward, stops again.
 GRUELLER
 Yo!  Who is that?  Don't mess with 
me man, I'll rip your head off.
 Nothing.
 GRUELLER (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 Come on, come out here.  Let's see 
what you got.
 RUSTLING.  No one.
 GRUELLER (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 Forget this.
 He turns on his heel, ready to drop all show and bolt.  
WALLY BESSEL is right behind him.
 Wally is a ninth grader, small, nerdy, and recently undead. 
In marked contrast to the older vampire in the prologue, 
Wally is freshly undead.  He still has fat on his face; in 
fact, he looks almost normal from afar.  But his inhuman 
eyes and his uncommon pallor mark him as a vampire.  And the 
way he speaks is unearthly.  Hollow, almost detached; 
repeating phrases sometimes almost as though he had never 
heard them before.
 He smiles at Grueller.
13.
 GRUELLER (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 Bessel!  What are you doing here?
 WALLY
 Hi, Grueller.
 GRUELLER
 What are you grinning at?  You 
think I was scared?
 WALLY
 Could be.
 GRUELLER
 You think so?
 WALLY
 Could be.
 Grueller grabs Wally by his shirt collar and readily hoists 
his small body up, Wally's feet dangling two feet off the 
ground.
 GRUELLER
 Listen, you little worm.  I could 
beat your head to a pulp for you, 
just like I did last year, you got 
that?  You got that?
 WALLY
 (repeating)
 Got that.
 GRUELLER
 Good.
 He lets Wally go.  Wally remains two feet in the air. 
Grueller's eyes go wide.
 GRUELLER (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 What the...
 Wally smiles even more broadly, quietly hissing.  He has 
long fangs, made somehow more grotesque by the fact that he 
also has braces.
 Wally's hands vise onto Grueller's head, lightning quick. 
Grueller screams.
 16
 ANGLE - PIKE AND BENNY

 Crossing a street, turning and listening.

 14.
 ANGLE - JEFFREY'S CAR
 17
 Speeding by, everyone packed into it.  Andy howls back at 
Grueller, mistaking his intent.  He settles back.  The girls 
are looking at him.
 ANDY
 It's um... you had to be there.
 In the front seat next to Jeffrey, Buffy winces slightly.
 JEFFREY
 You okay?
 BUFFY
 I... yeah, I'm okay.  I'm fine.

 INT. BUFFY'S LIVING ROOM - ANGLE ON TV - NIGHT
 We see another full moon, this one on the TV screen.  
"Dracula" is on, Lugosi's original.

 The lights are off in the living room as Jeffrey enters from 
the kitchen, sits down on the couch holding a bag of 
munchies. Buffy is still in the kitchen, making corn.  
Jeffrey flicks the remote, changes channels.

 ANGLE - THE TV

 The movie is replaced by the local news, in mid-broadcast.  
A NEWSCASTER sits at his deck, a super of a teenage girl 
behind him.
 NEWSCASTER-- The fourth such disappearance in 
less than two months.  The sheriff 
was not available for comment, but 
a police spokesman issued a 
statement, saying that the 
situation is not out of hand...
 INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME
 CUT TO:
 21
 Buffy's FATHER walks purposefully into the kitchen holding a 
suitcase that he plops by the front door.  He crosses out 
again as Buffy's MOM crosses in, also with luggage.
15.
 BUFFY'S DAD
 We're gonna be late.  I knew it.
 BUFFY'S MOM
 (to Buffy, but not 
looking at her)
 Now, we'll be back on Sunday, 
number's on the fridge, don't drive 
the Jaguar and tell Consuela my 
underwear does not go in the 
dishwasher.
 She's already out again by the end of this, as dad comes 
back in.
 BUFFY'S DAD
 Have fun be good stay away from the 
Jag.
 BUFFY
 I know.
 And he's out the back, mom entering on his heels.
 BUFFY'S MOM
 Well, that's everything.  Kiss 
noise.
 She actually makes a kiss noise at her daughter.
 BUFFY
 'Bye.
 Buffy's mom heads out the door as Buffy heads into the 
living room.
 22
 INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME
 BUFFY'S MOM
 (calling out)
 Bye-bye, Bobby!
 JEFFREY
 Bye!
 (to Buffy)
 They think my name's Bobby?
 BUFFY
 Well... it's possible they think my 
name's Bobby.
 JEFFREY
 Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.
 22
16.
 BUFFY
 Something like that.
 JEFFREY
 Hey, it works for me.  If they want 
to leave you alone in the house, 
all helpless and vulnerable...
 Buffy sits, squints disapprovingly at the screen.  She has a 
bag of microwave lite popcorn and is spraying diet butter 
substitute on it.
 BUFFY
 What show is this?
 JEFFREY
 It's the news, Buffy.
 BUFFY
 Oh.  Who's in it?
 (off his look)
 I know what it is.  It's what's on 
instead of the movie.
 JEFFREY
 I just want to see the basketball 
scores.  It's important.
 BUFFY
 (over a handful of 
popcorn)
 Mmmnkay.
 Jeffrey leans in toward her.
 JEFFREY
 Of course, there are... other 
considerations...
 He starts kissing her about the face and neck.  She leans 
submissively back on the couch as he works his way on top of 
her.  He gives her a long kiss on the mouth, then works over 
to her ear.  As he is burrowing about in there, Buffy sneaks 
another handful of popcorn into her mouth.
 She leans back, by accident, on the remote.

 INT. 18TH CENTURY CHINESE WHOREHOUSE - NIGHT
 24
 Not, by any stretch, an upscale joint.  Dark, cramped, and 
scummy.  A young Chinese Whore sits on a bed, wearing little 
enough that we can see the telltale birthmark on her 
shoulder. A repulsive British SAILOR is dressing, his 
business finished. Looking disgusted, he throws his payment 
on the bed.  For some reason, the bed is littered with 
popcorn.
 SAILOR
 You never touched my heart.
 He leaves.  Alone, the Girl hears a NOISE in the dark 
corner, a wet RUSTLING.  Slowly she gets up to see.  
Approaches...
 It is a pool of blood.  She stares at it, terrified.  A hand 
reaches out of it.
 She runs out into the hall, but it leads nowhere but a dead 
end.  Standing there, waiting for her, is Lothos.  He smiles 
at her and we see she is now Buffy.
 LOTHOS
 Soon.

 Buffy is thrashing in bed.  Jeffrey is holding her by the 
shoulders and shaking her.
 JEFFREY
 Buffy!  Hey, what's the sitch?!? 
Wake up!
 She wakes, grasping, her eyes melting into focus on 
Jeffrey's face.
 BUFFY
 Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.
 JEFFREY
 You were having a nightmare.
 He settles back down, his arms around her, and almost 
instantly begins to fall asleep again.
 JEFFREY (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 What'd you dream about?

 BUFFY
 Nothing.
 JEFFREY
 Come on, what was it?
 BUFFY
 Nothing.  It was just a dream.

 INT. LOTHOS' CHAMBER - SAME TIME
 CUT TO:

 Dark, cavernous -- walls hewn from rock, lit torches clamped 
to them.  Cold stone floor and in the foreground, a dark 
pool of blood.  A HUM, possibly a chant, fills the air.
 A figure steps up to the pool, his back to the CAMERA, and 
kneels before it.  He holds his hand over the surface of the 
blood.  As he speaks, his voice an urgent hiss, we TRACK 
AROUND him, see that it is Amilyn.
 AMILYN
 You have brought us here, and we 
thrive.  We thrive.  You will awake 
in a new world.  Just as I 
promised, untold splendor, rubies 
dripping from our lips.  Just as we 
said.

 EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY
 CUT TO:
 28
 Buffy sits with Nicole, Jennifer, Kimberly and CASSANDRA. 
Cassandra is not quite in the same league as the other girls -- for one thing, she studies.  She's not as glamorous, nor 
a vacuous.
 BUFFY
 The environment.
 They consider this a moment.
19.
 NICOLE
 The homelesses?
 KIMBERLY
 Oh, please.
 JENNIFER
 Are there any good sicknesses that 
aren't too depressing?
 BUFFY
 Guys.  The environment.  I'm 
telling you, it's totally key.  The 
earth is in terrible shape, we 
could al die, and besides, Sting's 
doing it.
 KIMBERLY
 I thought he was doing Indians.
 Jeffrey and Andy arrive, sit.  Jeffrey straddles Buffy from 
behind, wrapping his arms around her.  She snuggles in his 
grasp.
 JEFFREY
 Hey there.
 Hi.
 BUFFY
 JENNIFER
 (shyly)
 Hi, Jeffrey.
 ANDY
 Whatchya guys doing?
 NICOLE
 The winter dance.  We need to come 
up with a theme.
 JEFFREY
 The senior dance?  How about... 
'Our Friend, the Beer?'
 ANDY
 'Putting Out for Fun and Profit'... 
possible thought...
 KIMBERLY
 Try new Clue-flakes.
20.
 BUFFY
 It has to be, like a socially 
conscious theme.
 CASSANDRA
 (reading from a memo)
 'One that reflects the students' 
growing awareness of and 
involvement in the world around 
them.'
 JEFFREY|ANDY
 Downer.
 BUFFY
 I still say the environment.  
That's my suggestion.
 CASSANDRA
 It is a pretty crucial subject.
 BUFFY
 See, Cassandra likes it.  
Cassandra's my friend.
 ANDY
 I like it.  Can I be your friend?
 JEFFREY
 Stay away from my thang.
 (to Buffy)
 Sorry, honey.  'Thing.'
 NICOLE
 Environment.  That's cool with me.
 KIMBERLY
 Okay.
 CASSANDRA
 So, what are the most immediate 
threats to the world environment 
right now?
 Cassandra has paper and pen, is poised to make a list of 
suggestions.  The other all look at each other 
uncomfortably. Cassandra obviously knows the answer, but 
regards her friends silently, waiting to see what the come 
up with.
 JEFFREY
 Well, um... litter?
ANDY
 21.
 Litter, yeah!
 Everyone but Cassandra is impressed by this.
 JEFFREY
 (to Cassandra)
 Write that down.
 JENNIFER
 Okay, what else?
 NICOLE
 Forest fires?
 ANDY
 Communism?
 Bugs.
 BUFFY
 CASSANDRA
 (helpfully)
 Okay, guys, how about the ozone 
layer?
 KIMBERLY
 Oh, yeah!
 Right!
 NICOLE
 BUFFY
 We gotta get rid of that!  That's 
right.
 GARY MURRAY, a well meaning but pompous little 
administrator, come up to the kids.  He's kind of like 
Charlie Brown:  you always say his whole name.
 GARY MURRAY
 I don't suppose you kids heard the 
first bell, did you?  The first 
bell was saying, 'Start going to 
class, it's time to go to class.' 
In about thirty seconds the second 
bell is going to be saying, 
'Already be in class.'
 JEFFREY
 We're having a very important 
discussion here.
22.
 GARY MURRAY
 Why do I have trouble believing 
you?
 JEFFREY
 Something from your childhood, 
maybe?
 GARY MURRAY
 Button it, Kramer.  Classes are 
starting.  Be there or beware.
 Gary Murray walks off.
 ANDY
 Man has a complex.
 BUFFY
 He's got a...  What do you call it? 
A Napoleonic Code.
 JENNIFER
 It's 'cause he's so tiny.
 ANDY
 Yes, but what he lacks in height he 
makes up in shortness.
 They get up and start heading to class.
 KIMBERLY
 Let's meet tonight, okay?
 BUFFY
 Where?
 KIMBERLY
 Cafe Blase.
 NICOLE
 Cool.  We can figure decorations 
and stuff.
 BUFFY
 Cassandra, you gotta come, too.
 CASSANDRA
 Can't.  History report.  The 
Normans and the Saxons.
 BUFFY
 Bogutude.  Blow it off.
23.
 CASSANDRA
 I really can't.  Besides, it's 
pretty interesting.
 BUFFY
 (not harshly)
 You're weird and I'm afraid of you. 
Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot 
cooler things you could be doing 
than your homework.
 CASSANDRA
 Like what?
 BUFFY
 Like my homework.
 Buffy smiles, trots off.

 EXT. THE CITY - NIGHT
 CUT TO:
 29
 We see SHOTS of the deserted city at night.  It's a small, 
upscale town.  Suburban streets, businesses, and a  few more 
depressed areas, boarded up houses.  No one is out.  TREES 
RUSTLE, shadows flicker, but the curling mist is the only 
visible presence.
 CUT TO:

 INT. CAFE BLASE - NIGHT
 30
 A classic faux-Fifties L.A. diner.  Pictures of Frankie and 
Annette, bright lights, those same tired Fifties standards 
playing on the JUKEBOX.  Buffy, Kimberly, Jennifer and 
Nicole are sitting at the end of the counter, at the corner.
 KIMBERLY
 I don't see why we have to invite 
everyone.
 BUFFY
 Kimberly, it's the senior dance.
 NICOLE
 If we don't invite all the seniors 
we can't use the school funds, you 
know that.
 KIMBERLY
 Can't they make exceptions?  
Maryanne Heinel?  
(MORE)
24.
 KIMBERLY (CONT'D)
 She's such a scud.  Can't we have a 
Maryanne clause?
 NICOLE
 Well, look who's here.
 GIRLS' POV
 Pike and Benny have entered the 
diner, quite drunk.  As they pass 
the jukebox, Benny gives it a kick 
and the music stops. A few people 
look up, annoyed, as they approach 
the counter.
 WAITRESS
 Hey!
 BENNY
 The Fifties are over.
 PIKE
 (earnestly)
 We have to learn to let go.
 WAITRESS
 Don't give me any trouble, okay?
 PIKE
 No trouble.  We just want to eat.
 They sit next to Buffy and begin pooling their money on the 
counter.  It comes to about $2.50, heavy with pennies.
 PIKE (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 Come on, come on, fork up the scub.
 BENNY
 That's it, man.  That's the whole 
story.
 PIKE
 We're looking at a dog, possible 
coffee...
 He digs and produces a quarter from his pocket.
 PIKE (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 It's coffee.
 BENNY
 Amazing!
25.
 KIMBERLY
 (to the other girls)
 Smell of booze much.
 NICOLE
 Nice much.
 PIKE
 (to the waitress)
 Can we have a hot dog, please, 
medium rare, and a cup of joe?
 BUFFY
 You guys are thrashed.
 JENNIFER
 (to Buffy)
 What are you talking to them for?
 BENNY
 (to Buffy)
 What did you say?
 PIKE
 Yeah, we're drunk.  We're the 
Drunks. What's your name?
 BUFFY
 Buffy.
 Figures.
 BENNY
 PIKE
 Do people ever call you 'Buffy the 
Buffalo?'  I'm just wondering.
 Buffy gives him a look.
 PIKE (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 The don't.  You kind of wish they 
would, though.
 KIMBERLY
 Wit-tay.
 PIKE
 I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is 
Benny.
 KIMBERLY
 Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
26.
 PIKE
 Hey, wait a minute...
 BENNY
 You're the guys from the movie!
 PIKE
 (good naturedly)
 We hate you guys!
 The girls all make sad noises, real sarcastic.
 PIKE (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 You guys were way rude.  It was 
shocking.
 NICOLE
 You just snuck in anyway.
 PIKE
 So you have to ruin the movie for 
us?  You know, other people have 
feelings, too.
 KIMBERLY
 I am so sure.
 The waitress brings the hot do.  Benny takes it out of the 
bun and holds it over his crotch, phallus-like.
 BENNY
 Hey, Buffy, you hungry?  I got 
something for you...
 The other girls look down and shriek.  Buffy looks at Benny, 
looks at him in the eye.
 31
 ANGLE - BUFFY'S HAND
 It closes silently around the knife at her place.
 31
 Buffy is still looking at Benny, she seems to be hypnotizing 
him, and maybe even herself.  The NOISE in the diner seems 
to FADE AWAY for a moment.  Buffy shifts slightly, almost a 
twitch, and the spell is broken.  The SOUND RETURNS, Buffy 
looks away, letting go of the knife exactly where it was.
 Benny looks down.  His hot dog has been sliced neatly down 
to about an inch.  He is shocked.
 BENNY
 (continuing)
 Hey!  She wasted my dog!
27.
 PIKE
 (smiling)
 Bummer metaphor.
 Buffy looks off, a little surprised herself.
 32
 EXT. STREET - NIGHT
 CUT TO:
 32
 Pike and Benny have left the diner and are walking down the 
street.  Pike produces a bottle of Mezcal from his coat 
pocket and takes a swig, hand it to Benny.  They continue to 
pass it back and forth.
 BENNY
 Rich bitches.  They're a plague. 
They've gotta be stopped.
 PIKE
 You didn't like them.
 BENNY
 They're all the same!  They're so 
stuck up, they're just... they're 
not even human.  I hate them.
 PIKE
 Would you sleep with them?
 BENNY
 Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely. 
Please, God.
 PIKE
 Well, there it is, isn't it?  You 
don't even like them, and you'd 
sleep with them.  What's that all 
about?
 BENNY
 I got a news flash, man, another 
shot of this and I'll have sex with 
you.
 PIKE
 Oh, yeah, and then you'll never 
call me.
 They continue walking.  A shadowy figure appears behind 
them, following.
 CUT TO:
33
 28.
 INT. DINER - NIGHT
 The girls have all finished their sundaes.
 NICOLE
 Come one, that was so weird.
 BUFFY
 (uncomfortable)
 What, it's not weird.  I just cut 
the stupid hot dog in half.
 KIMBERLY
 I can't believe they still ate it.
 JENNIFER
 (to Buffy)
 Where'd you learn how to do that?
 BUFFY
 I didn't learn... I just... it's 
not a big deal.
 KIMBERLY
 Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you 
were playing with another man's 
Hebrew National.
 BUFFY
 (annoyed)
 Get a boob job.
 NICOLE
 It's like when we took gymnastics 
in eighth grade.
 33
 Buffy makes a face.  She doesn't want to hear this story.  
We HOLD on her as Nicole tells it.
 JENNIFER
 What happened?
 NICOLE
 Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- 
she was really good; coach said she 
could have been in the Olympics -- 
but she was doing a routine, 
spinning, and the beam broke.
 JENNIFER
 You're kidding.
29.
 NICOLE
 Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on 
the upswing, and I swear to God she 
went across the room.  Perm over 
heels.
 JENNIFER
 Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you 
quit.
 NICOLE
 Well, that's the thing.  She landed 
on her feet.  Didn't even sprain a 
toe.  And I go up to her and she 
turns and looks at me and she's 
like this -
She makes a hyper-intense face.  The others laugh.
 NICOLE (CONT’D)
 (continuing)-- like she's gonna kill me.
 BUFFY
 I was just scared is all.
 NICOLE
 No.  It was mondo bizarro.
 KIMBERLY
 Buffy, the ape-woman.
 NICOLE
 Seriously, Buffy.  That look was 
way twisted.  What were you 
thinking about?
 34
 EXT. STREET - NIGHT
 CUT TO:
 Perhaps in answer, we see the same shadowy figure moving 
behind Pike and Benny as they continue to walk home.  
34
 They're really bombed now.  They are somewhere in the hills 
now, and they come to the edge of a steep incline 
overlooking the valley.  A waist-high concrete wall is built 
into the side of the earth. They stand below a thick, green 
tree.
 PIKE
 I'll have it running in a week. 
It's be beauty.  
(MORE)
30.
 PIKE (CONT'D)
 It just needs new shocks, you know, 
break pads, an engine, and some 
wheels.  It'll be totally cherry.
 Pike finishes the bottle, eats the worm, and chucks the 
BOTTLE over the side.  There is a moment before they hear it 
SHATTER.
 BENNY
 When you get your car together, 
man, let's bail.
 PIKE
 You think?  Split?
 BENNY
 Utterly.  Let's bail this town. 
It's getting... I don't know.  
Let's go somewhere where there 
aren't any rich bitches.
 PIKE
 Our own world, where we could live 
and grow beans.  Hundreds of beans.
 Benny wavers, catches hold of Pike.
 BENNY
 I think I'm gonna ralf.
 He leans over the side of the wall, hangs his head down.
 PIKE
 Don't worry, Benny.  I'm here for 
you.
 Pike falls over backwards.
 PIKE (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 I'm here for you, Ralf.
 Pike passes out.
 35
 CLOSEUP - BENNY
 35
 Still waiting to throw up.  The figure approaches slowly 
from behind him.  The figure is a few feet away from him 
when a hand shoots down from above and grabs Benny's face.
 36
 ANGLE - IN THE TREE
 Amilyn sits on a low branch, pulls Benny up to face him.  
Amilyn has changed his manner of dress drastically.  
36
31.
 He wears a motorcycle jacket and sunglasses.  His hair is 
punked out. Benny is in shock, as Amilyn holds him easily by 
his shirt collar.
 AMILYN
 You wanna go for a ride?
 Amilyn leans back -- all the way back, falling back out of 
the tree and pulling Benny with him.  We see them fall out 
past the wall just as the shadowy figure reaches it.
 It is Merrick, the man from the mall.  He runs to the side 
of the wall, looks over.  The two are already lost in the 
dark mist.  Merrick turns around, looks about him.  He digs 
in his pockets, pulls out a cross and a stake, holds them 
tightly. While digging he pulls out an old, stained picture, 
lays it on the railing.  Stake and cross in hand, he stands 
by Pike looking out at the night.
 37
 ANGLE - THE PICTURE
 37
 It is a ten year old girl about to blow out the candles on 
her birthday cake.  The cake reads, "Happy Birthday, Buffy".

 38
 EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - AFTERNOON
 Buffy, Nicole and Jennifer and another cheerleader are 
practicing.
 JENNIFER
 What was the step after...  The one 
from Thursday.  I never learned it 
right, I don't think.
 Buffy shows her.  They do it together for a minute.
 BUFFY
 That is so cool.
 NICOLE
 Thank you very much.
 BUFFY
 Nobody is even gonna look at the 
game.
 JENNIFER
 Hey, I was thinking, for the dance, 
what about a big sign that says 
'Don't Tread On Me'.  You know, and 
a picture of the earth.
 38
32.
 BUFFY
 Don't tread on the earth?
 NICOLE
 I don't get it.
 BUFFY
 How do you not tread on the earth? 
I mean, you kind of have to.
 JENNIFER
 I never thought of that.
 NICOLE
 I gotta bail.  You coming?
 BUFFY
 You guys blow.  I'm waiting on 
Cassandra.  She's gonna help me 
with my history.
 NICOLE
 Cassandra's really smart.
 BUFFY
 Yeah... She's okay, though.
 NICOLE
 I guess.
 JEFFREY
 Are you going out with Jeffrey 
tonight?
 BUFFY
 Jealous?
 Jennifer laughs, uncomfortably.
 BUFFY (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday 
your prince will come.
 NICOLE
 Yeah, just make sure you do first. 
Let's go, guys.
 BUFFY
 B'bye.
 The other girls leave.  Buffy is alone on the empty field. 
She looks around her.  She starts doing a routine, 
tentatively. 
33.
 Then she runs toward the middle of the field and jumps, 
flies into an extraordinary series of gymnastic flips and 
cartwheels. She rolls into one final flip, a huge one, and 
lands, a perfect ten, about three inches from Merrick.
 She screams in surprise, steps back.
 BUFFY (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 God, where the hell did you come 
from?  You scared me to death.
 MERRICK
 I'm sorry.  That was impressive. 
The...  tumbling.
 His accent is clipped -- British.
 BUFFY
 What?  Oh.  I used to do 
gymnastics. Are you looking for 
someone?
 MERRICK
 I'm looking for you, actually.
 BUFFY
 Am I in trouble or something?
 MERRICK
 Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I 
was sent to find you some time ago. 
I should have found you much sooner 
but there were...  complications. 
You should have been taught, 
prepared.
 BUFFY
 What are you talking about?
 MERRICK
 I've searched the entire world for 
you, Buffy.
 BUFFY
 Why?
 MERRICK
 To bring you... your birthright.
 BUFFY
 My birthright?  You mean, like a 
trust fund?
Merrick looks at her.
 34.
 BUFFY (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 I had a trust fund my great- 
grandfather, or maybe it was an 
inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and 
I spent it on shoes.
 MERRICK
 You must come with me.  It's much 
too late already.  You must come 
with me to the graveyard.
 BUFFY
 Wait a minute.  My birthright is in 
the graveyard?  Later not.
 MERRICK
 Wait!
 BUFFY
 You're one of those skanky old men 
that, like, attack girls and stuff. 
Forget you.  My, um, my boyfriend 
is gonna be here in about thirty 
seconds, and he's way testy.
 MERRICK
 You don't understand.  You have 
been chosen.
 BUFFY
 Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why 
don't you just take the first 
runner up, okay?
 MERRICK
 You must believe me.  You must come 
with me while there's still time.
 BUFFY
 Time to do what?
 MERRICK
 To stop the killing.  To stop the 
vampires.
 BUFFY
 Let me get this straight.  You're 
like, this greasy bum, and I have 
to go to the graveyard with you 
'cause I'm chosen, and there's 
vampires.
35.
 MERRICK
 Yes.
 BUFFY
 Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you 
to do things?  Do you see spots?
 MERRICK
 I don't have time for your 
prattling. I have proof.  You bear 
the mark.
 He steps forward and pulls the neck of Buffy's shirt aside, 
revealing her shoulder.
 MERRICK (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 The mark of the Coven!  The -- 
where's the mark?
 There is no birthmark on her shoulder.  He looks at the 
other one.
 MERRICK (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 The mark of the -- wait a minute.
 Buffy pushes his hand off her.
 BUFFY
 You mean that big hairy mole?  
Excuse me:  eeyuu.  I had it 
removed. And, like, knowing about 
my big old mole isn't proof of 
anything except that it's way past 
medication time.
 She starts to walk away.
 BUFFY (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 Just stay away from me, okay?
 MERRICK
 Did you ever dream that you were 
someone else?
 Buffy stops.  This obviously registers with her.
 BUFFY
 Everybody does.
MERRICK
 36.
 In the past.  A girl.  Maybe... A 
Magyar peasant.  An Indian 
princess. A slave.
 The last one hits the mark.
 BUFFY
 I was a slave.
 MERRICK
 In Virginia.
 BUFFY
 I don't know.  It was...  There was 
a big gram or something.  And 
there's one, I'm like a 
prostitute...
 MERRICK
 China.
 BUFFY
 Oh, my God.  I never told anybody 
about this.  I remember the one 
about the peasant, too.  God, 
there's a bunch.  Is this, like 
channeling or something.
 Merrick rolls his eyes.
 BUFFY (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 I had a dream once where I was... 
There was like, knights in it, and 
I worked in this bar.  And I... was 
fighting.  I'm always fighting. And 
there's a guy...  He's not always 
there, but he's horrible, all 
white, and he's always... trying to 
kill me.
 MERRICK
 Lothos.
 The name has an obvious effect on the girl.
 BUFFY
 How do you know all this?
 MERRICK
 I have to show you.
 CUT TO:

 37.
 ANGLE - THE SUN
 Thick and orange, sinking beyond the hills.

 41
 EXT. GRAVEYARD - SUNSET
 Merrick leads Buffy, searching for a particular grave.
 BUFFY
 I can't believe I'm doing this.  I 
can't believe I'm in a graveyard 
with a strange man hunting for 
vampires on a school night.
 MERRICK
 Why didn't you ever tell anybody 
about your dreams?
 BUFFY
 Oh, yeah, tell everyone I'm crazy. 
Beauty ida.
 Buffy stops, winces slightly.
 BUFFY (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 Ow.
 Cramps?
 MERRICK
 BUFFY
 None of your business.  God.
 MERRICK
 This is it.
 Buffy is standing on a freshly dug grave.  The headstone 
reads:
 "ROBERT BERMAN, 1972 - 1990.  GOD IS AT HIS HEELS".
 MERRICK
 (continuing)
 Robert Berman was killed three days 
ago.  The body was found in the 
bushes out by the canal.  Extensive 
tissue damage -- tearing -- at the 
neck and shoulders.  Coroner thinks 
it's a dog.  You sit her.
 He points out a plot of ground about eight feet from the 
foot of the grave.  Buffy sits and leans against another 
stone.
 39
 40
 41
38.
 Merrick reaches into his jacket, pulls out a stake and a 
cross, hands the cross to Buffy.
 BUFFY
 Wait a minute.
 MERRICK
 Just for protection.  You won't 
have to do anything.  I just need 
you to watch.
 BUFFY
 All right.  What do we do now?
 MERRICK
 We wait for Robert to wake up.
 Merrick goes over to the other headstone, crouches by it.
 BUFFY
 Do you have any gum?
 42
 43
 ANGLE - SUNSET
 The last red glimmer disappears behind the hills.
 EXT. OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL - SAME TIME
 CUT TO:
 42
 43
 Cassandra stands waiting for Buffy.  The sun is down, 
darkness increasing.  She looks at her watch and gives up, 
heads for her car.  Her key in the door, she hears a 
RUSTLING behind her.  Looks slowly around.
 CUT TO:
 44
 EXT. GRAVEYARD - SAME TIME
 Buffy sits fidgeting.  Playing with her fingernails.  
Merrick stays in the position, listening.
 44
 A low, almost inaudible MOAN come from under the ground.  
Buffy sits up straight, holds the cross to her.  The MOAN 
becomes louder, almost a scream.  The SOUND is followed by 
the SOUND of FINGERS SCRAPPING wood -- of WOOD SPLINTERING -- 
of digging. The moaning continues, becoming eerier, somewhat 
more articulate.
 Buffy and Merrick wait.
45
 39.
 ANGLE - THE GRAVE
 45
 Finally, fingers break through the ground and hold stiff in 
the open air.  The moan becomes a triumphant HISS.  The 
fingers clutch at the ground.
 ROBERT BERMAN pops halfway out of his grave like a jack-in
the- box, his face dirty and dead-white.  He sees Buffy in 
front of him, and he bobs toward her with a crazy grin, 
stretching as to a mother's tit.
 Merrick drops down behind Robert and grabs him, raising the 
stake.  Buffy watches, immobilized.
 A pair of arms shoot up from the ground right under Buffy. 
They grab her and pull her to the ground.  Next to her face, 
the face of another vampire, a YOUNG WOMAN, emerges grinning 
from the crumbling earth.
 Buffy screams lustily, and struggles to break free.
 Merrick is momentarily distracted by this, and Robert throws 
him off, and pulls himself out of the grave.  Merrick falls 
to the ground, and his stake goes flying.
 Buffy pulls herself out of the girl's grasp, starts running 
away, but the girl grabs her.  Buffy remembers the cross in 
her hand, spins and holds it to the vampire's forehead.  It 
burns and the lady lets go, screaming and falling to the 
ground.
 BUFFY
 'Bye now.
 Buffy runs.
 46
 ANGLE - MERRICK AND ROBERT
 46
 They are struggling, several feet away.  Robert grabs 
Merrick by the shoulders and picks him up, preparing to bite 
him.  A stake suddenly pops out of his chest, planted in his 
back by Buffy.  He falls and dies.
 MERRICK
 Where's the other one?
 BUFFY
 She -
It leaps at her, screaming.  She throws it off, as Merrick 
produces another stake and throws it to her.  Buffy sticks 
it in the vampire's heart.  She dies, screaming, her face 
still smoking, blood spurting onto Buffy.
40.
 Buffy looks at herself.  At the blood.
 47
 EXT. FRONT OF BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
 CUT TO:
 Merrick walks Buffy to the door.  She is silent, slow.
 MERRICK
 Go to school tomorrow.  Try to act 
normal.  Don't let anyone know 
what's happening.  This is 
important. When the vampires find 
out who you are... you won't be 
hunting them anymore.
 BUFFY
 All right.
 He hands her a piece of paper.
 MERRICK
 Meet me at this address after 
school.
 BUFFY
 I have cheerleading squad.
 MERRICK
 Skip it.
 Buffy nods.  Merrick starts back down the path.
 BUFFY
 Merrick.
 Merrick stops.
 BUFFY (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 They can't come in, right?  Unless 
you invite them.  Is that true?
 MERRICK
 It's true.
 Merrick moves on.  Buffy goes inside.

 INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - FOYER - SAME TIME
 48
 Buffy shuts the door, turns to go up to her room.  She is 
startled by someone standing in her path.  She almost 
screams.
 It's her mother.  She stands, arm akimbo, looking very 
confrontational.  Buffy looks a sight, and stands 
uncomfortably in front of her mother for a moment.
 BUFFY'S MOM
 Do you know what time it is?
 BUFFY
 Uum... around ten?
 Mom taps her watch, annoyed.
 BUFFY'S MOM
 I knew this thing was slow.
 She crosses out of the room.
 BUFFY'S MOM (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 You pay a fortune for something...
 (calls out)
 Honey, come on, we're gonna be 
late.
 Her mother gone, Buffy lets out a small sigh -- of relief or 
frustration, it is not clear.  She heads upstairs.

 Lothos is beside her.

 INT. SCHOOL HALL - DAY
 51
 Buffy walks through the hall slowly, obviously the worse for 
last night's wear.  Gary Murray comes up next to her, 
looking at his watch pointedly:  she's late for class.  He 
moves on. Jeffrey, going the other way, stops next to her.
 JEFFREY
 Hey, baby, how ya doing?  You look 
beat.
 BUFFY
 I do?  I guess I do.
 JEFFREY
 Where were you last night?  I 
called your house like four times.
 BUFFY
 I went to sleep.  I think I have 
the flu or something.
 Jeffrey backs away from her.
 JEFFREY
 I can't get sick.  You know -- 
training and all.  I'm gonna be 
late.
 BUFFY
 'Bye.
 Jeffrey moves off to class.  Buffy walks on a bit.  She 
bumps into Nicole.
 NICOLE
 Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.
 BUFFY
 Thanks.
 NICOLE
 You and Cassandra get anything done 
last night?
 Buffy looks confused for a moment, then remembers.
 BUFFY
 Oh.  No.  She never showed.

 INT. LOTHOS' CAVE - CLOSEUP OF CASSANDRA'S FACE
 52
 She is waking up, obviously from being knocked out.  She 
blinks stupidly, looks around.  She is lying by a pool of 
what looks to be dark water in a large cave.  Torches burn 
around her.
 She tries to get up and finds it difficult.  She pulls 
herself up to the side of the pool and splashes water on her 
face.
 It's blood.
 She starts, staring with growing horror at her hands.  She 
does not even see the figure rise from the pool at first.
 It's Lothos.  He wears no shirt, only white trousers and 
boots, the style maybe Nineteenth Century.  No blood seems 
to touch him as he rises.  He looks at Cassandra with an 
almost sleepy lust.
 LOTHOS
 I find it restorative, sleeping in 
the life-blood of so many.  To feel 
their souls coursing about me.
 CASSANDRA
 What's happening?  What do you 
want?
 LOTHOS
 (smiling)
 So very much.
 CASSANDRA
 My parents have money...
 LOTHOS
 Yes, I'm sure they do.  This place 
is everything you said it was, 
Amilyn.
 Cassandra turns.  Amilyn stands behind her, grinning.  He 
hisses, bares his fangs at Cassandra.
 CASSANDRA
 What... are you?
 LOTHOS
 Are we so strange?  So alien to 
you?  I've seen this culture, the 
wealth, the greed, the waste... 
it's truly heartwarming.  The 
perfect place to spread my empire.  
(MORE)
44.
 LOTHOS (CONT'D)
 Honestly, Eastern Europe was so 
dead, the Communists just drained 
the blood out of the place.  It's 
livened up a bit in the past few 
years, but it's nothing compared to 
this.... this Mecca of consumption.  
The city of Angels.
 He steps right up to her.
 LOTHOS (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 What are we?  We are man, 
perfected. We exist to consume.
 On the world "to consume" we see Amilyn mouthing the words 
with Lothos, his eyes to the ceiling.  He's heard this a 
hundred times.
 AMILYN
 So?  Do we change this one, or do 
we just drain her?
 Cassandra pulls her gold card out of her wallet.
 CASSANDRA
 Here, look.  My gold card.  It's 
your.  I'll never report it.
 Amilyn snatches it from her, looks it over.
 LOTHOS
 She has a certain quality, this 
one...
 Amilyn bites the card.
 AMILYN
 I don't think this is gold.
 LOTHOS
 Not as single-minded as the others, 
not as sybaritic.  Almost 
thoughtful. She's useless.
 CASSANDRA
 No, wait.  I can be dumb.  Really. 
Or mean, or whatever.  I can learn. 
I'm useful.
 LOTHOS
 Really?
45.
 CASSANDRA
 Swear to God.
 He rips out her throat, tearing at it with his teeth as 
blood gushes around their faces and she wriggle, twists, 
dies.  He hurls her into the door and wipes blood from his 
mouth.
 LOTHOS
 I wish you wouldn't mention him...
 Slowly Cassandra slides down the wall, her eyes glazing 
over. As she descends we see, stenciled on the wall, "Hemery 
High School.  Maintenance Only."

 INT. WAREHOUSE - AFTERNOON
 CUT TO:
 53
 Grey, dusty and long since abandoned.  Sunlight pours in 
through the large windows, practically caked with dust.  Old 
crates are stacked here and there, bits of manikins leaning 
on one or two.  Merrick sits on a crate, reading the 
newspaper.
 Buffy enters hesitantly, puts down her bookbag next to a 
pile of Merrick's stuff, including a rolled-up sleeping bag.  
This is definitely not her turf.  She runs her finger along 
a crate, picks up a world of dust.  She holds up her finger 
at Merrick.
 BUFFY
 Fire the help.  No kidding.
 Merrick looks up at her.
 MERRICK
 It's not pretty, but it does suit 
our purposes.
 BUFFY
 Our purposes.
 She repeats it not with attitude, but a dull wonder at her 
connection with this strange man.  She crosses to him.
 BUFFY (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 What, um...  What do we do?
 MERRICK
 There's a great deal I have to show 
you, I'm not even sure where to 
start  There's so little time.
BUFFY
 46.
 Why do you keep saying that?
 MERRICK
 Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
 BUFFY
 A Vampire-King?  You mean like 
Dracula?
 MERRICK
 Oh, yes.  And the man from your 
dreams.  Lothos.
 BUFFY
 Oh, him.
 MERRICK
 Yes.  They travel about, usually 
with one or two of their followers 
to lay the groundwork.  The 
vampires find a community and they 
feed on it, make it their own.  You 
were difficult to trace, and I 
think the process has gone a lot 
further than I'd anticipated.  
Usually this goads a community into 
some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But 
for some reason, nobody here seems 
to be paying any attention.
 BUFFY
 (not paying attention)
 What?
 MERRICK
 (annoyed)
 We'll cover it later.
 BUFFY
 I still don't get how they happened 
to come to my town.  I mean, was I 
born here because... because they 
were coming here?  That Lothos guy, 
and his buddies?
 MERRICK
 In a way, yes.  Your fate is 
inexorably connected to them.
 BUFFY
 Great.  First I have a birthright, 
now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I 
have to take notes on this?
47.
 MERRICK
 (put down his paper)
 We're going to have the work hard. 
You'll need some excuse for staying 
out.  For your parents.
 Buffy laughs.
 BUFFY
 Not a pressing issue.
 MERRICK
 I tell you, the best thing I can do 
right now is find out more about 
you.  What your strengths are, your 
likes...  Everything.  What's your 
best subject?
 BUFFY
 Uh... gym.
 MERRICK
 Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But 
you stopped.  Why?
 BUFFY
 Well, everybody says... it's just 
kind of dorky.  I mean, have you 
ever seen a gymnast's legs?  
They're like -
(indicating huge)-- the mighty oak.  It's not a 
look.
 MERRICK
 But you enjoyed it, yes?
 BUFFY
 Well... I do cheerleading now. It's 
way cooler.
 MERRICK
 Cheerleading.  For... sporting 
events, yes?
 BUFFY
 Sporting events, yeah.
 MERRICK
 All right.  Why don't you show me a 
cheer?
 BUFFY
 Here?
48.
 MERRICK
 Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. 
A nice cheer.
 BUFFY
 Okay.
 Buffy starts, a bit awkwardly, doing a cheer.
 BUFFY (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 Who we gonna beat?
 MERRICK
 (pathetically following 
her motion)
 Who we gonna beat?
 BUFFY
 (stops)
 No -- you don't have to -
MERRICK
 Oh.  I thought... you lead me -
BUFFY
 No.  You don't do anything.  I do 
it.
 MERRICK
 Oh.  Good.
 She starts again.
 BUFFY
 Who we gonna beat? Who do we 
defeat? Who will we be pulverizing 
Into cream of wheat?
 Gradually, Buffy gets more into the cheer.  The steps become 
more complicated as she repeats the verse.
 54
 CLOSEUP - MERRICK'S HAND
 54
 We see a knife slip out of Merrick's sleeve.  He palms it, 
hands behind his back.
 In the middle of her routine, he hurls it at her.  She 
catches it, reflexively, inches from her face.  Stops dead.  
Then bursts into tears.  Merrick is thrown off by this 
reaction.
49.
 BUFFY
 Oh, what the hell is wrong with 
you?  You threw a knife at my head!
 MERRICK
 I had to test you.
 BUFFY
 But you threw a knife at my head!
 MERRICK
 And you caught it!  Only the chosen 
one could have done that.
 BUFFY
 I don't want to be the chosen one, 
okay?  I don't want to spend the 
rest of my life chasing after 
vampires!  I just want to graduate 
from high school, go to Europe, 
marry Charlie Sheen and die.  It 
may not sound too exciting to a 
sconehead like you, but I think 
it's swell.  And then you come 
along...  and... and then I'm a 
member of the hairy mole club, so 
you throw things at me!
 She is coming at him now.  He begins to back up.
 MERRICK
 It was necessary.
 BUFFY
 (realizing)
 Last night.  You knew I was sitting 
on a fresh grave, didn't you?
 MERRICK
 I don't think you understand the 
full implications of -
Buffy punches him in the face.  He goes flying a good ways, 
lands on his back.  His nose bleed merrily.  Buffy stops.
 BUFFY
 Oh.  Sorry.
 MERRICK
 (getting up)
 Don't you see what's happening? 
You're changing.  You've got powers 
you've only just begun to tap. 
(MORE)
50.
 MERRICK (CONT'D)
 Physical, mental prowess you've 
never dreamed of.
 (pulling a handkerchief 
out of his pocket)
 God, this hurts.  I've administered 
a few shocks to your system to 
start the adrenaline working.  I'm 
sorry I have to take so many 
shortcuts in the training process.
 BUFFY
 Put your head back.
 MERRICK
 Two days ago, would you have even 
hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
 BUFFY
 No... I guess I would have gotten 
Jeffrey to hit you.
 MERRICK
 Exactly.  You're changing.  You're 
becoming something extraordinarily 
powerful.
 Buffy looks at the knife in her hand.  The MUSIC COMES UP 
and we...
 55
 A SERIES OF IMAGES AND INTERCUT SCENES
 CUT TO:
 55
 Buffy's period of training.  Over the difficult course of 
it, she is obviously becoming more self-possessed, more at 
ease. Her style of dress loosens a bit:  a little punkier.  
Stops dying her hair blonde and her roots start showing.  
Accumulates a few more holes in her ears.

 Merrick sits on a crate, reading the obituaries and circling

is a nail brush, with which she is very carefully painting 
her toenails.

bloody and dead, slumped on the floor.

 EXT. SCHOOL - DAY

 Buffy kissing Jeffrey goodbye after school.  A long,

 EXT. MINIATURE GOLF COURSE - AFTERNOON
 Merrick and Buffy are playing.  Merrick tees off, shoots 
horribly.
 BUFFY
 (as announcer)
 Ooh, another embarrassment for the 
teabag, while the chosen one is 
still well under par.
 MERRICK
 Your turn.
 Buffy positions herself.
 62
52.
 BUFFY
 What about bats?  Do they turn into 
bats?
 MERRICK
 No.  No bats, no flying.  They... 
float, occasionally.  Not really 
flying.
 BUFFY
 Toasty.  Were there ever any, like, 
famous vampires?
 MERRICK
 Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, 
Joseph Mengele, Franklin 
Pangborn... are any of those names 
familiar?
 BUFFY
 If I say 'no' does that make me a 
bad person?
 MERRICK
 Good Lord.  What do you study in 
history?
 BUFFY
 My nails.
 She gives a little 'isn't that funny' kind of laugh.  He 
doesn't respond.
 MERRICK
 All right.  You've heard of the 
emperor Caligula, perhaps?  Or Jack 
the Ripper?
 BUFFY
 They were vampires?
 MERRICK
 Same one.
 Oh.
 BUFFY
 She considers this a moment.  Tees off:  another hole in 
one.

 EXT. WAREHOUSE  (LATER)

 INT. CHURCH - AFTERNOON
 Buffy walks in, looks around.  She approaches a PRIEST.
 BUFFY
 Excuse me...
 PRIEST
 Yes, my child?  Is something 
troubling you?
 BUFFY
 Well, sort of.
 PRIEST
 Well, maybe I can help.
 BUFFY
 Yeah.  Um... Could you bless these?
 She holds up a six-pack of Perrier.
 INT. LOTHOS' CAVE - NIGHT
 CUT TO:
 66
 67
 We see the entire cave, the still pool of blood, the torches 
lit.  At the far end sits Lothos.  In his arms is the body 
of a dead girl.  Blood stains her neck and yet the image is 
poetic, reminiscent of Michelangelo's "Pieta".  
54.
 They are both perfectly still, her draped across his lap, he 
with his eyes far far away.  The silence holds.
 Lothos belches massively.
 68
 INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
 CUT TO:
 68
 Merrick is lecturing Buffy.  Buffy is sitting, doodling in 
an open notebook, "uh-huh"ing and obviously not paying 
attention.
 MERRICK
 ... Lothos was probably born in the 
eleventh or twelfth century; he's 
been difficult to trace.  His power 
has increased with age.  It will be 
a long while before you are ready 
to face him.  We'll be lucky if we 
can get him to leave the area, to 
lie low for awhile.  That will 
scatter the rest of them.  Lothos 
is...
 He looks at Buffy, who is staring down at her notebook.
 MERRICK (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 ... is extremely powerful, but he 
is still a vampire, and vulnerable 
to the same...
 He looks at her.  Is she listening?
 MERRICK (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 Daylight is still his enemy.  The 
stake can still find his heart.
 Is she?
 MERRICK (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 I have huge antlers growing out of 
my buttocks.
 Nope.  No reaction, just another "Uh-huh."

 ANGLE - BUFFY'S NOTEBOOK

 Merrick slams a stake right through the middle of it.  Buffy

 Buffy sits in his chair.  Gary moves about his desk, sitting 
behind it, leaning on it, talking to her.  A FLY BUZZES 
annoyingly about his head.
 GARY MURRAY
 Well, I think we can safely say 
that something's going on with you, 
Buffy.  Now, there's nothing to be 
nervous about; you're not in any 
trouble.  I just hoped maybe we 
could talk.  Don't think of me as 
Gary Murray, administrator.  Think 
of me as Gary Murray, party guy! 
Happening dude who can talk to the 
young.  Me and you.  It's open... 
Tell me.  It's drugs, isn't it?

 EXT. FOREST - AFTERNOON
 74
 Buffy stands under a tree, blindfolded.  Merrick stands a 
ways apart, watching.  Buffy stands very still, neck craned, 
waiting.
 Silently, a leaf falls.  It wafts gently down.  Buffy hurls 
a knife at it with easy precision.
 75
 76
 77
 ANGLE - ANOTHER TREE
 The knife stick deep into the trunk, the leaf perfectly 
pinned.

 Merrick looks at it.  Buffy smiles, knowing she has hit the 
target.  Blindfold still on, she turns toward Merrick and 
walks into a branch, falls heavily backwards.
 CUT TO:
 INT. GARY MURRAY'S OFFICE - DAY
 The same session, continuing.  Buffy still sits, 
expressionless, in the chair.  The FLY still BUZZES.
 GARY MURRAY
 Hey, there's nothing to be afraid 
of!  I know where you're coming 
from.  Believe me.  I'll tell you 
the truth.  I've had my drug 
experiences, too.  I did a lot -- I 
did some acid in the Sixties.  
Well, the late Seventies, actually.  
It was at a Doobie Brother's 
concert.
 INT. THE MALL - DAY
 CUT TO:
 76
 77
 Buffy at the mall with Kimberly, Nicole and Jennifer.  For 
the first time, we really see how she stands out against her 
friends.  She is wearing much more functional, cool garb, 
and less makeup, while they still sport the same dainty shit 
from the beginning.
 They stop to look at some dresses.  Something in the next 
store catches Buffy's eye; she wanders off.
 CUT TO:
78
 57.
 INT. GARY MURRAY'S OFFICE - SAME TIME
 Gary Murray is crouching on his desk.  Buffy still sits.  
The FLY still BUZZES.
 As Gary talks, Buffy picks up a push pin from the table 
beside her, holds it.
 GARY MURRAY
 ... and I could see the music 
flowing into me, it was bright red 
and electric, and I felt like a big 
toaster, and I thought, maybe I am 
a toaster, we're all molecules, and 
my friend Melissa, her head looked 
like a big party balloon, and that 
scared me, I started to freak 
out...
 Buffy surreptitiously puts the push pin in her mouth.

 Buffy hasn't moved, or opened her mouth.  The FLY BUZZES on. 
Gary Murray now sits behind his desk.
 GARY MURRAY
 I guess you're surprised.  Well, 
you know, there's more to most 
people than meets the eye.  
Everybody's got a secret.  I just 
want you to know that you can 
always share your secrets with me.  
What you say in this office, it 
will stay in this office.  I'm your 
pal.
 Buffy smiles at Gary.  As he looks away for a second, Buffy 
spits out the push pin.  The BUZZING STOPS.
 CUT TO:

 Buffy sparring with Merrick again.  She holds a stake.  This 
time she ends up pinning him, the stake at his solar plexus.
 He moves the point to where his heart would be.
 82
 INT. PIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
 CUT TO:
 82
 The room is a shambles.  Outside the first floor window, it 
is dark night.  "Help Yourself" by the Posies blasts from 
Pike's STEREO.  Pike lies on his bed.
 Through the window we see Benny approach, slowly fading up 
to the pane.  He's floating, really.  (He's a vampire.)  He 
scrapes his fingers on the glass.
 BENNY
 Pike...
 Pike sits up, turns down the music.  He goes to the window, 
begins to try to open it.  It's stuck.
 PIKE
 Benny, man, where you been?  You 
bailed on me, I passed out, man, I 
almost did a Jimi Hendrix!
 BENNY
 Let me in.
 PIKE
 Hey, I'm trying, but this window is 
burnt -
Pike gets a good look at Benny for the first time.
 BENNY
 Invite me in, Pike.
 PIKE
 Wait a minute.  What's wrong with 
you, man?
 BENNY
 I'm fine.
 PIKE
 You look like shit, Benny.
 Benny grins, presses his slimy forehead against the glass.
59.
 BENNY
 I... feel.... pretty.
 PIKE
 No offense, man, but I think you're 
on something nasty.  Why don't you 
just go and cool out and I'll see 
you in the morning or something.
 BENNY
 The sun!  It burns!  It burns!
 He laughs at his impression, brown spittle caking the 
window.
 BENNY (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 Let me in, Pike!  I'm hungry!
 PIKE
 Get away from here.
 BENNY
 I'm hungry.
 PIKE
 I mean it.
 Benny smiles, moves suddenly out of sight.  Pike looks at 
the window for a second, then bolts out of his room.  He 
runs to the front door, frantically hooks the chain.  Benny 
appears at the door's little window, banging and scraping 
the glass.
 BENNY
 I'm hungry!  I'm hungry!  I'm 
hungry!
 Pike backs away.

 EXT. DESERTED STREET - NIGHT
 CUT TO:
 Buffy walks slowly down the street, trying to appear 
nonchalant, but looking about her a lot.
 BUFFY
 Sure is cold.  What a dark night. 
Nice night for a walk.
 She whistles some, keeps walking.
 83
60.
 BUFFY (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 'Feelings, la la la la feelings'... 
Boy, I'm helpless.
 She passes an alley and there is a RUSTLING amid the garbage 
cans.  She moves slowly down the alley toward the noise.  
She is about halfway down when a rat scurries out from the 
cans and down a drain.
 BUFFY (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 Yeucch.
 Behind her, another SOUND.  She turns slowly.  At the 
entrance to the alley stands a vampire.  They stare at each 
other, some thirty feet away.
 BUFFY (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 Hello...
 She moves back a step.  The vampire takes a step.
 BUFFY (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 What do you want?
 It floats rapidly at her, hissing.  Buffy looks about her 
frantically, trapped.  It hits her at top speed and she 
instantly rolls onto her back, flipping it and hurling it 
against the wall at the end of the alley.  As it hits, 
Buffy, still rolling, produces a stake from her jacket and 
throws it directly at its heart.  The stake punctures the 
startled creature's chest.  Before he can so much as grab 
it, Buffy throws a roundhouse kick, driving the stake all 
the way home with her foot.  The vampire screams, sinks to 
the ground.
 Buffy turns, triumphant.
 BUFFY (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 Toaster-caked him!

 EXT. OUTSIDE THE WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
 85
 The two exit Merrick's car, an old Dodge Dart.  As they 
talk, they make their way into the warehouse.  Buffy looks 
out for trouble while Merrick unlocks the door.  This is 
obviously their routine.
 MERRICK
 He was slow.  Very simple.  They 
won't all be that easy.
 BUFFY
 Fine.
 MERRICK
 And the alley was a mistake.  Never 
corner yourself like that.  If 
they'd come at you in force you'd 
be dead now.  One vampire is a lot 
easier to kill then ten.
 BUFFY
 Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything 
to you?
 MERRICK
 You felt a little sick, didn't you? 
The cramps.
 They enter the warehouse.
 86
 INT. THE WAREHOUSE - SAME TIME
 They unload their stuff as they argue.
 BUFFY
 Nice conversationalist!  Yeah, I 
felt 'em a little, but I ain't due 
for two weeks since you're so 
excited about the subject.
 MERRICK
 It's natural.  A reaction to their 
presence, to the... unnaturalness 
of it.  It's part of how you are 
able to track them.
 BUFFY
 Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks 
for telling me.
 CUT TO:
 86
MERRICK
 62.
 You'll get used to it.  I'm more 
worried about your tactical 
mistakes.
 BUFFY
 You are such a wet.
 MERRICK
 A what?
 BUFFY
 A wet!  Didn't I just kill that 
vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't 
see you killing any vampires.  You 
were too busy playing 'Beat the 
Clock'.
 MERRICK
 Don't start with me again.
 BUFFY
 Aren't I, like the chosen one?  The 
one and only?  The Grand High 
Poobah and doesn't that mean you 
have to be nice to me?  Like, ever?
 MERRICK
 Buffy...
 BUFFY
 And why are you always wearing 
black? It's so down.  It's totally 
not your color.  I don't think you 
have a color.
 MERRICK
 What do you want?  Encouragement?
 (in bad American accent)
 'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I 
just want to give you a great big 
hug, oh I'm just having a warm 
fuzzy.'
 BUFFY
 Oh, fuck you!
 Merrick turns on her.
 MERRICK
 Do you know how many girls I've 
trained to be Slayers?  Five.  
(MORE)
MERRICK (CONT'D)
 63.
 Five properly prepared girls, girls 
who faced their responsibilities, 
who worked hard to become women 
overnight -- harder than you've 
ever worked in your life -- and I 
saw them ripped apart.  Do you want 
to live?  Do you?
 BUFFY
 I...
 MERRICK
 What did you think, that being able 
to jump about and hit people makes 
you a Slayer?
 Buffy looks at him a bit.
 BUFFY
 Five?
 Five.
 MERRICK
 BUFFY
 So, basically, I've got the life 
expectancy of a zit, right?
 MERRICK
 Not if you're careful.
 BUFFY
 How can you keep doing this?
 MERRICK
 It's what I was raised to do.  
There aren't many of us left, the 
Watchers.
 BUFFY
 Watchers?
 MERRICK
 There's a small village in 
Hampshire, near Stonehenge...
 (sees she doesn't know 
it)
 ... near a bunch of big rocks. 
That's where I was born.  My father 
taught me about the training, about 
finding the Slayers, reading the 
signs.  There's a small cluster of 
us, a few families, really... 
(MORE)
MERRICK (CONT'D)
 64.
 most of the neighboring villagers 
think we're just a bunch of 
harmless old loonies.  I thought so 
myself for a time, when I was 
younger...
 (stops himself)
 I'm sorry.  I'm not supposed to... 
I shouldn't go on like this.
 BUFFY
 I wish you would.
 MERRICK
 It isn't important.
 BUFFY
 I'm curious, is all.
 MERRICK
 Buffy, don't... don't start 
thinking of me as your friend.  It 
interferes with the work, and it...
 BUFFY
 And it makes it worse when I die, 
right?
 Silence.
 BUFFY (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 Well, you know, I'm not gonna kick 
so easy.  I've got a few things the 
other girls didn't have.
 MERRICK
 As for example, what?
 BUFFY
 Well... there's my keen fashion 
sense, for one.
 MERRICK
 Vampires of the world, beware.
 BUFFY
 (impressed)
 Merrick.  You made a joke.  Are you 
okay, I mean, do you want to lie 
down?  I know it hurts the first 
time.

 In spite of himself, Merrick smiles.

by the railway tunnels.  Nobody's 
saying anything, but they think she 
was involved in something, like, 
illegal or something.  Like 
dealing.
 KIMBERLY
 Well, I hope so.
 JENNIFER
 Probably was.  What do you suppose 
she was doing out there.
 BUFFY
 Dying.
 Eeyuu.
 JENNIFER
 Coming from the opposite direction are Jeffrey, Andy and 
some of the other football players.  They're suited up and 
heading for the gym.
 ANDY
 ... And they're having some 
memorial service or something 
tomorrow.  You going?
 JEFFREY
 I don't know.  Coach said I had to 
work on my 'ab's.'
 ANDY
 Coach knows what abs are?
 They pass Buffy.  Andy stops and grabs her from behind.
 ANDY (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 Got to get some!
 Unthinkingly, Buffy flips Andy over and pins him against a 
locker.
66.
 ANDY (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 Whoa!  Whoa!  I'm sorry.  I'm 
sorry. I don't actually need any 
right now.
 JEFFREY
 (to Buffy)
 What's with you?
 BUFFY
 Don't grab me, okay?
 ANDY
 Absolutely.  I see now the error of 
my mistake.
 JEFFREY
 Yeah, keep your mitts off my thang. 
I'll pop you one.
 (to Buffy)
 Did he scare you?
 Jeffrey puts his arm around Buffy but she shakes it off.
 BUFFY
 I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.
 JEFFREY
 So I noticed.
 Buffy goes off by herself.  Jeffrey watches her.
 JEFFREY (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 Nice to feel needed.
 ANDY
 Let's move out!
 JEFFREY
 (rallying)
 Yes!
 The lads move off.  We see Nicole, Kimberly and Jennifer, 
who have been watching the whole exchange.  Nicole and 
Kimberly are obviously disdainful of Buffy's behavior.  
Jennifer is feeling sorry for Jeffrey.  Boy does she want 
him.

 INT. CLOTHING STORE - DAY
 88
 A mod, brightly lit store.  A little hipper than your usual 
mall fare, but not Melrose either.  Bright colors reign.  
Buffy is standing by a dressing stall, inspecting her 
fingernails, talking to Merrick as he changes inside.
 BUFFY
 I mean, most of the time Jeffrey's 
really sweet, but sometimes he gets 
kind of... 'Me-Tarzan'ish, you know 
what I mean?  Lately it bugs me, I 
guess.
 (no response)
 Merrick?  Are you still breathing?
 MERRICK (O.S.)
 (from inside)
 I can't work this.
 BUFFY
 We call them zippers.  They're not 
supposed to be a challenge.
 MERRICK
 But it's in the back.  Why are we 
wasting time with this, anyway?
 BUFFY
 Because you clash, Merrick.  You 
clash with everything.  I mean you 
might as well go around with a 
sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  
Honestly, you look like something 
out of... Pasadena.
 MERRICK
 My clothes have always been 
perfectly serviceable.
 BUFFY
 Well, you're on my turf now.  
You're just gonna have to trust me.
 Merrick comes out of the booth.  He wears multi-colored 
parachute pants and an equally loud T-shirt.  Buffy looks at 
him -- he looks at himself.
 MERRICK
 I want to die.

 BUFFY
 (doesn't like it either)
 Okay.  The important thing is not 
to panic.

 EXT. ZEPH'S AUTO REPAIR - LATE AFTERNOON
 CUT TO:
 89
 Pike is hurriedly working on a part in the hood of his beat
up Dodge, which is filled with all his belongings.  ZEPH 
stands watching him.  Zeph is about forty-five, greasy, good
natured. Pike works for him.
 PIKE
 You said you'd have the part by 
two!  Christ, it's almost dark.
 Pike finishes, slams the hood.  He picks up a battered 
guitar case and stuffs it into the car, shuts the door.
 ZEPH
 What nasty bug crawled up your 
bungus and where the hell are you 
going?
 PIKE
 I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing 
town. This place has gotten way too 
hairy.
 ZEPH
 Where am I gonna find another 
mechanic stupid enough to work for 
my money?
 PIKE
 Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
 ZEPH
 No...  You want me to give him a 
message?
 PIKE
 You should think about leaving, 
too, man.  Sell this place... 
Something's going on here.  I don't 
know.  Something real weird.
 Pike gets in the car.  It sputter, starts.
 ZEPH
 Ah, you'll be coming back.
69.
 PIKE
 I don't think so.
 ZEPH
 All right.  Take care of yourself.
 PIKE
 I am.
 ZEPH
 Hey.  What should I do if I see 
Benny?
 PIKE
 Run.
 Pike peels out.  Zeph watches him go.

 intersection. Pike is hunched over the wheel, his head down 
as he listens to the rasping ENGINE.
 PIKE
 Come on, come on.  Don't leave me, 
baby.  Come on, breathe.
 Amilyn appears in the street in front of the car.  Pike 
finally hears the SCRAPING OF HIS FEET as he approaches the 
car.  Pike straightens up slowly, and as the rear view 
mirror comes INTO THE FRAME, we see there are two more 
behind him.  They are both high-school age, fresh like 
Bessel and Benny.  They all approach, slowly.
 Pike waits for a second, his hand on the key.
 PIKE (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 This is for the money, baby.  Make 
me proud.
70.
 He turns the key again and the car ROARS to life.  The 
headlights trap the hungry scowl of the vampires as Pike 
pops the car in reverse, smashing into the back two 
vampires.  They both go flying, hurt but not killed.
 92
 ANGLE - INSIDE THE CAR

 Pike races at Amilyn, but he leaps up as Pike reaches him, 
and Pike hears a THUD as Amilyn lands on the roof of his 
car. Pike continues to bullet down the street as a hand 
suddenly punches through the roof, grabbing at him.  He 
fights off the hand and tries to control the speeding car.
 It can't be done:  he goes off the road and into a park.  
The car careens along.

 They pass under the branch and we hear a TEARING THUD.  The 
arm stiffens and falls into Pike's lap.
 The car hits another tree dead on.  Pike slams into the 
steering wheel.  The guitar case flies right through the 
windshield and lands on the grass.
 Pike pulls himself slowly from the car.  He is bleeding, but 
not badly.  Just shaken.  He hears a low, seething WAIL from 
a few yards back and turns around.  Amilyn is getting 
shakily to his feet.
 PIKE
 Oh, give me a break.
 Amilyn hisses at him, then turns and races away, snarling, 
clutching what's left of his arm.
 One of the other vampires nears him.  Pike tries to run and 
his knees buckle.  He lands on them right next to the guitar 
case.  As the vampire nears, he pulls the guitar out of the 
case and swings it, hitting the vampire in the head.  
71.
 He hits him again.  The vampire bats away the guitar and 
grabs Pike. Brings his face to Pike's as Pike squirms.
 A blasting kick in the head from Buffy.  The vampire is 
flung to one side, falls.  He starts up at Buffy and she 
nails him with a stake.  Pike stares at her.  She pulls a 
walkie-talkie from her pocket.
 BUFFY
 (into walkie-talkie)
 I'm on the east side, near the 
playground...  all right.
 She puts the walkie-talkie back.
 BUFFY (CONT’D)

 Hi.
 Hi there.
 PIKE
 BUFFY
 Is that your car?
 PIKE
 It was.  I think it's pretty much

The last vampire hits Pike from behind.  Without missing a 
beat, Buffy picks up the guitar and snaps the neck off.  She 
and the vampire meet in the middle -- the creature barely 
moves before she buries the guitar neck in its chest.  It 
falls.
 Merrick runs up.  He is wearing black jeans and a 
windbreaker. He is more modern than he was before, but 
subtly.  He sees the decaying bodies, one with a guitar 
sticking out of its chest.
 MERRICK
 Interesting.
 BUFFY
 I kind of had to improvise.
 (to Pike)
 Sorry about your guitar.
 PIKE
 That's okay.  Umm, listen, I'm 
not.... I have to fall down now.

 Pike's eyes glaze over slightly as he collapses into Buffy's 
arms.

 INT. BOILER ROOM - CLOSEUP ON AMILYN - NIGHT

 Thrashing about the room in hysterics, screaming and 
snarling, banging his one fist on the boiler tank.  It booms 
hollowly. Lothos grabs him, throws him up against the wall.
 LOTHOS
 What's wrong with you!?!
 AMILYN
 My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
 LOTHOS
 Shut up!  You let him have it!
 Lothos lets Amilyn go.  Amilyn still fumes, quietly.
 LOTHOS (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 You reckless imbecile.  This place 
is ours for the taking and you let 
yourself... twelve hundred years 
old and you act like a child.
 AMILYN
 I had him in my grasp.
 LOTHOS
 Cheer up.  You may still.
 Only Lothos smiles at the joke.  Amilyn raises his stump, 
looks at it.  The tattered end of his jacket covers the 
grossness of it, but it still isn't good.
 AMILYN
 (forlornly)
 I look horrible.
 LOTHOS
 The other two -- the new ones. 
Where are they?
 AMILYN
 I don't know.  But the boy, he 
couldn't kill them.
 LOTHOS
 (thoughtfully)
 No... Not a boy...

 LOTHOS (CONT'D)

 Find out if they're dead.  And do 
something about that arm.  
Honestly, I don't know how you made 
it through the Crusades.
 He turns toward his chamber.
 LOTHOS (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 Let me know about our little 
recruits.  I'll be in my chamber...
 On his way through the door he passes a box on an oil drum. 
He plucks a large kitten out of it.

 INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
 CUT TO:
 Buffy and Pike walk in, Pike still a bit unsteady on his 
feet.
 BUFFY
 How are you doing?
 PIKE
 Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of 
miss my knees, though.
 BUFFY
 You want some water or something?
 PIKE
 Water.  Okay.
 They move into the kitchen.
 PIKE (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 Do you do this kind of thing a lot? 
I mean, is this like a hobby?
 BUFFY
 Not exactly.
 PIKE
 They were vampires, weren't they?
 98
74.
 BUFFY
 Yeah.
 PIKE
 God!  Unbelievable.  Vampires.
 Buffy hands Pike the water and they move back into the 
living room.  Pike curls up in an armchair by the window.  
Buffy begins stripping off her bloody clothes, leaving on a 
tank-top and jeans.
 BUFFY
 You had a car full of stuff.  Were 
you leaving?
 PIKE
 Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a 
friend, and he's really... well, 
he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad 
scene.
 BUFFY
 Well, stay here tonight.
 PIKE
 Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a 
bus.  I'm gone.
 BUFFY
 Where are you gonna go?
 PIKE
 Well, I've always wanted to see 
Oxnard.
 As Buffy strips down to her tank top, she notices a gash on 
her arm.  It's not bleeding much any more, but it's fairly 
impressive.  Pike jumps up to help as she pats it down with 
her shirt.
 PIKE (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 Hey, jeez are you okay?  You need a 
hand?
 BUFFY
 It's nothing.  It doesn't hurt.
 Pike looks at her a moment as she wraps her shirt around it.
 PIKE
 (almost awed)
 Who are you?
75.
 Buffy doesn't look up.  The questions seems to upset her a 
great deal.  She even fights back tears.
 PIKE (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 I'm sorry, I just mean... well you 
seemed like such a flake.  But, in 
a good way!  I can just keep 
talking till you strike me dead, 
or...
 Buffy smiles at this, though still upset.  She sits down.
 BUFFY
 Things are kind of confusing.
 PIKE
 I'll back that up.
 BUFFY
 Three weeks ago all I thought about 
was... well, I didn't actually 
think about anything.  I definitely 
didn't expect this.
 PIKE
 I know.  My guidance counselor 
never mentioned anything about 
vampires. 'Prison' came up a few 
times, but nothing about undead.
 BUFFY
 It's weird.  I went back to my old 
grade school once, to the 
playground -- I used to hang out 
there all the time, playing on the 
swings and stuff... I went back and 
it was so tiny, the whole place.  I 
couldn't even fit on the swings.  
Everything just looked so small.
 (collects herself)
 I'm sorry.  I'm babbling.
 PIKE
 No, you're not.
 But she stands anyway, head to the stairs.
 BUFFY
 I'm kinda beat.  You can stay in my 
mom's room if you want.
76.
 PIKE
 I think I'll just hang out here. 
Make sure the sun comes up and 
everything.
 BUFFY
 You sure?
 PIKE
 Oh, I'll be fine.  Got my chair, 
got my window, I'm great.
 BUFFY
 Mmkay.
 She starts up the stairs.
 PIKE
 Hey, Buffy...
 BUFFY
 Yeah?
 PIKE
 You know, you saved my life.  And I 
just wanted to say... I forgive you 
for talking during the movie. 
Almost.
 She gives him a look, heads upstairs.  He watches her go, 
looks out the window.

 There isn't time.
 BUFFY
 Make time, okay?  You're the one 
who told me to act normal.  I've 
missed three practices already.  If 
I'm not there for the Barber game 
tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
 MERRICK
 Another distraction.  It's not 
right.
 BUFFY
 Why because it's not my fate?  It's 
not in the Book-of-All- 
Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be 
cheerleading at the Barber game?
 MERRICK
 Sooner or later you're going to 
have to accept it.  Your fate.
 BUFFY
 I'm pretty much learning not to 
accept anything anymore.  Come on, 
Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we 
can kill and kill until there is 
nothing left.
 MERRICK
 All right.
 BUFFY
 Toasty.  You should come; it's 
gonna be a great game.
 MERRICK
 Oh, I'll be there all right.  I'm 
not letting you out of my sight. 
Not till you're ready.
 BUFFY
 Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act 
like a fan.
 MERRICK
 (being a fan)
 Football is my life.

 BUFFY
 You're learning.  Slowly, 
incredibly slowly, but you're 
learning.
 She turns to go.
 MERRICK
 None of the other girls ever gave 
me this much trouble.
 BUFFY
 And where are they now?
 She smiles at him and runs up the steps, where Jeffrey is 
waiting for her.  He looks at the departing figure of 
Merrick.

 We see Merrick taking a seat.  He is wearing another new 
outfit -- a letterman jacket and baseball cap.  He has 
binoculars around his neck.  He takes his seat amidst the

 Right.  So I don't care about your

you're worried about your grades. 
Maybe you dog just died or you've

 Winning!
 COACH
 And how do we win?

whose face we cannot see.
 COACH
 There you are!  You missed practice

 On the sidelines, a player hobbles out and coach pushes 
Grueller in.  He passes Buffy and she winces slightly.  It 
messes up the routine and Nicole practically falls over her.

 TEEN
 Everybody knows about her, man.

is way open.  He catches it easily, looks behind him as he 
runs. Barber players are rushing at him.  And Grueller is 
coming at him too, throwing other players right and left.
 Jeffrey looks a little worried.  He bolts down field, toward

 Buffy races for the crowd.  She sees Jeffrey is all right. 
Grueller makes his way out of the throng and up into the 
stands even as everyone else is rushing onto the field.
 Jeffrey is triumphant.  He sees Buffy running for him and 
raises his arms.  She passes him right by and continues

 The stands reach some thirty feet off the ground.  Buffy 
sails down like a diver, grabs a branch about halfway down.  
She swings like a gymnast and the branch snaps.  Still 
holding the broken branch, she completes a perfect flip and 
lands on her feet.
 The vampire fan is on the ground behind her, come for her 
and without stopping or even turning she twirls the branch 
and sinks the broken end in his heart.
 She looks around for Grueller.  He is booking out, already 
several yards away..
 Merrick appears at the top of the stands just in time to see 
Buffy take off after Grueller.

 A RUSTLING in the trees signifies Grueller's flight.  
Seconds late, Buffy roars into view behind him.  She 
navigates the streets with less ease than determination.
 Her eyes follow him off the road and she steers the bike on 
a violently bumpy and erratic course through the site.  She 
finally hits a pile of bricks and is thrown headlong from 
the bike.  She hits the ground hard; she rolls into it but 
has trouble getting up.
 BUFFY'S POV
 Grueller's smiling face appears 
over her.
 GRUELLER
 Fall down go boom have to see the 
nurse.
 BUFFY (O.S.)
 Grueller, God, what did they do 
you?
 He brings his face right next to hers.  His voice is no 
longer passionless; it boils up from hell.
 GRUELLER
 They killed me.
 RESUME SCENE
 He grabs her and hauls her up.
 BUFFY
 No kidding.
 She head-butts him with enormous force, sending him 
staggering back.  Before he can recover, she dives for a 
pile of discarded lumber, chooses a nasty shard of wood.
 She turns on Grueller, who is smiling again.  There are two 
more Vampires approaching her, surrounding her.
 GRUELLER
 The Master walks tonight.  This is 
his kingdom, now.
 They rush her.  She takes one on as the second hits her, 
knocking her over.  They all three swarm over her, meeting 
her kicks with raking claws.  The two hold her in front of 
Grueller.

 You know, Buffy, I've always wanted 
you.
 He smiles again and leans toward her neck.
 The stake that pops out through his chest is as much a 
surprise to him as it is to Buffy.  He falls backward, 
shocked and dead. Behind him stands Pike.
 One of the other vampires stupidly goes after Pike, who runs 
away.  Buffy instantly flips the other one over onto 
Grueller, impaling him as well.
 Pike runs more or less in a circle, yelling, the vampire at 
his heels.
 PIKE
 I didn't mean it!  I didn't mean 
it!
 Wooden shard in hand, Buffy sprints toward them, jumps into 
a series of flips.  She lands with her legs around the 
vampire's shoulders, plants the stake in its heart as they 
topple onto Pike.
 For a moment, Pike and Buffy lie on top of each other, 
breathing hard.  Then they get up awkwardly, embarrassed by 
their touching, (and by their slight arousal).
 BUFFY
 I didn't expect to see you.
 PIKE
 I know.
 BUFFY
 Why'd you come back?
 PIKE
 I don't know.  I kind of thought I 
ought to be here.  You know, this 
isn't exactly the kind of thing you 
can run away from.
 BUFFY
 Thanks.
 PIKE
 Besides, Oxnard sucks.
 They start out of the site.
87.
 PIKE (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 Listen, I... I really do want to 
help.  I mean, these guys are dag 
nasty, and somewhere my best friend 
is out there, and I'd like to, I 
don't know.  Even the score.  Do 
some damage.  I'm good with damage.
 127
 ANGLE - KIMBERLY'S CAR
 127
 She drives by, see Buffy with Pike.  It's an eyebrow-raiser, 
but she keeps driving.
 BUFFY
 Pike, I don't think you're up to 
this.
 PIKE
 I think I could help.  You gonna 
tell me you don't need help?
 128
 EXT. STREET - SAME TIME
 CUT TO:
 128
 Merrick runs up to the street where Buffy took the Harley.  
He has shed the raccoon coat.  The biker is still there, 
standing in the road trying to thumb a ride.
 MERRICK
 Did you see a girl come by here?
 BIKER
 You don't mean, like, a 
cheerleader?
 MERRICK
 Yes.
 BIKER
 Yeah, I saw her.  Bitch took my 
wheels.
 MERRICK
 Wheels?
 BIKER
 My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She 
told me.
 MERRICK
 Which way did she go?
88.
 BIKER
 Down there.
 He points.  The CAMERA PANS with Merrick as he takes a step 
in that direction, leaving the biker behind (and momentarily 
OUT OF FRAME).
 MERRICK
 Idiot girl.  Can't watch over her. 
How long ago did -
The CAMERA PAN back with Merrick as he turns to the biker, 
but in his place stands Lothos.  Not five feet from Merrick.
 MERRICK (CONT’D)
 Oh, my God.
 129
 ANGLE - THE BIKER
 129
 On his knees, Lothos' hand firmly locked around his throat. 
He cannot move or breathe.
 Merrick and Lothos look at each other a moment.
 LOTHOS
 It's a beautiful night.  I have 
never understood the human tendency 
to equate darkness with emptiness. 
To me the black is so thick with 
life, like soil...  like blood. 
Darkness writhes under my eye.
 He looks at the night.  Merrick slowly reaches for a gun 
stuck in the back of his pants as Lothos continues.
 LOTHOS (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 I know who you are.  She's out her, 
as well, isn't she?  Another 
Slayer. Who is it this time?  What 
offering have you brought me?
 130
 EXT. ANOTHER STREET - ANGLE ON BUFFY - SAME TIME
 She is crouching on the ground, holding her stomach and 
gritting her teeth.
 PIKE
 Buffy?  What's wrong?
 BUFFY
 Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's 
him.
 130
89.
 PIKE
 Who?
 BUFFY
 (not answering)
 Merrick...
 Buffy ups and runs in the direction of the noise.  Calls 
back to Pike.
 BUFFY (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 Stay here.
 She runs out of sight.
 131
 132
 EXT. STREET - ANGLE ON THE BIKER - SAME TIME
 Lothos lets him go and he falls, dead.
 LOTHOS
 It doesn't really matter.  The 
names, the faces, they all melt 
together. After a time, there 
really is no difference.  One more 
pathetic bitch, begging for me to 
suck on her clotted heart.
 MERRICK
 This one may surprise you.
 CLOSEUP - THE GUN
 CUT TO:
 131
 132
 Merrick holds it firm behind his back, finger on the 
trigger.
 LOTHOS
 I rather doubt it, if she was 
raised here.
 He laughs.  He doesn't appear to have noticed the gun, but:
 LOTHOS (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 Where is she?  I can't wait to meet 
her.  Do you think she's ready to 
face me?  Or perhaps you can stop 
me with that gun.
 MERRICK
 Perhaps.
90.
 Merrick looks out at the trees nearby.
 MERRICK'S POV
 Buffy appears, far away, between 
the trees.
 Merrick looks at Lothos, afraid he will notice.
 133
 ANGLE - BUFFY
 133
 Approaching, stopping some twenty yards away.  She looks 
about her for a weapon.
 LOTHOS
 Look at you.  You pathetic thing. 
So small, so full of fury.  After 
you've served me for a hundred 
years, I think you'll have a little 
more perspective.
 MERRICK
 I don't think so.
 Lothos rushes suddenly at Merrick, hissing, his feet just 
off the ground.  Merrick steps back, whips out the GUN, and 
SHOOTS himself without hesitation in the head.
 Buffy's eyes go wide.
 Lothos growls, holding Merrick's spurting corpse.
 A small, involuntary noise escapes Buffy.
 134
 CLOSEUP - LOTHOS
 Even twenty yards away, he hears.  He spins and stares, 
starest at CAMERA.  Listening.
 134
 Buffy walks slowly, silently backward, fading back into the 
dark, terrified and shocked.
 Lothos turns back and looks at Merrick dead in his hands. 
Disgusted, he lets him drop.
 LOTHOS
 Fool.
 He looks at the blood on his fingers.  After a moment, he 
tastes it.
 CUT TO:
135
 91.
 EXT. STREET  (LATER)
 Pike is standing by the trees where Buffy stood before, 
looking out into the street.
 PIKE'S POV
 The same angle as Buffy's, before.  
Now Lothos is gone.  Buffy is 
kneeling quietly by Merrick, 
holding his head in her lap.
 135
 CUT TO:
 136
 137
 EXT. A WOOD - JUST BEFORE DAWN
 136
 Through the dark mist Buffy appears, carrying Merrick's body 
in her arms.  She is alone.  She does not stop.
 CUT TO:
 EXT. GRAVEYARD - MORNING
 137
 On the outskirts of the graveyard, Buffy finishes filling in 
Merrick's grave under an old tree.  She is still wearing her 
cheerleader outfit, now caked with dirt.  She stands at the 
foot of the grave, tries to think of a prayer.
 BUFFY
 Ummm, our Father, Who art in 
Heaven, duhmm... hallowed be Thy 
name. Uhh, kingdom come, daily 
break, I don't know.  I don't even 
know if you're religious.  You 
probably are.  But you're dead, you 
know. You're just totally dead.  
and...
 She sits heavily on his grave.
 BUFFY (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 ... and I don't know what to do. 
You were the one who... I don't 
know if the training was over.  I 
don't even know if I passed.  
You're so stupid!  How could you be 
so stupid?  What am I supposed to 
do without you?  You son of a 
bitch!
 She stops, looks down for a moment.
92.
 BUFFY (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 Amen.
 138
 INT. ZEPH'S AUTO REPAIR - DAY
 CUT TO:
 138
 Pike is at work on a contraption.  Built out of scraps and 
parts, it is the beginnings of a cartridge-load crossbow. 
Zeph watches, behind him.
 ZEPH
 Hah, I'd knew you'd be back.  
Didn't I say you'd be back?  Ha, 
ha, ha! You're sitting in your old 
car saying 'Nope, I'm never coming 
back.' Hee, Hee!  Like you got 
anywhere to go.  'I'm never coming 
back'  But I knew you would.  Birds 
got to return to the nest sooner or 
later.  That's what I said.  Just 
like I told you...
 Pike pays no attention to this babbling monologue.  Over the 
course of it he takes a slim, handmade wooden shaft, 
slightly thicker than an arrow, and rubs it with garlic.  He 
places it in the crossbow, take aim in front of him.  He 
fires into the tire of a truck.  The tire pops flat.  Zeph 
cracks up.
 ZEPH (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 Hah!  Shot the damn tire, dumbass, 
didn't even look, just going around 
shooting things, popped it flat, ya 
bonehead.
 Pike, still not listening, continues to work.
 139
 INT. GYM - DAY
 CUT TO:
 139
 We see a banner stretched across the central beam of the 
ceiling.  It reads "THE EARTH IS OUR HOME".  A half dozen 
inflatable globes dangle from the ceiling.  Nicole and 
Kimberly are stetting up the drinks table, unloading and 
stacking hundreds of styrofoam cups.  Jennifer crosses by 
them, carrying an armful of plastic wrappings and 
containers.
93.
 JENNIFER
 I got all the plastic stuff.  What 
should I do with it?
 KIMBERLY
 ("you idiot")
 Throw it out.
 Jennifer crosses out as the two resume their conversation.
 NICOLE
 I really was way way too too.
 KIMBERLY
 Oh, please!  When she ran onto the 
field in the middle of the game? 
Was that the most out-of-it thing 
ever, or did I blink?
 NICOLE
 I'm, like, yelling at her, 'What 
are you doing?'  And she's going 
'Jeffrey, Jeffrey!'  Way mental.
 They laugh.  Jennifer is the first to see Buffy walk in, 
looking cleaned-up but still ragged.  They stop laughing.
 JENNIFER
 Hi, Buffy.
 Hi, guys.
 BUFFY
 KIMBERLY
 You were supposed to be here at 
three.
 BUFFY
 I forgot.
 KIMBERLY
 Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're 
acting like The Thing From Another 
Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.
 BUFFY
 Look, a lot's been going on.  
That's what I wanted to tell you 
guys about. I need to tell you.  
You see... a while ago, I met this 
guy -
KIMBERLY
 Oh my God you're having an affair.
NICOLE
 94.
 Cool!
 JENNIFER
 Does Jeffrey know?
 BUFFY
 It's not that at all.  This is an 
old guy, he's like fifty.
 KIMBERLY/NICOLE
 Eeyuu.
 BUFFY
 No, no.  Listen.  Haven't you guys 
noticed how weird things have 
gotten around here?  Like, people 
disappearing, people turning up 
dead...
 NICOLE
 What are you talking about?
 KIMBERLY
 Weird?  You mean like you hanging 
out with that homeless, Poke?  I 
saw you last night after the game.
 BUFFY
 Pike.
 NICOLE
 You're having a fling with him?
 JENNIFER
 He doesn't look fifty.
 BUFFY
 Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of 
her five minutes ago.
 KIMBERLY
 Oh, thank you very much.
 NICOLE
 Like you've got a grip.
 KIMBERLY
 You're so out of it.  You've blown 
off cheerleading, you've blown off 
dance committee -
BUFFY
 95.
 Excuse me for having something 
important to do.
 KIMBERLY
 This isn't important?  The earth is 
our home.
 BUFFY
 Kimberly, it's a dance.  It's a 
stupid dance with a bunch of stupid 
kids that I see every stupid day.
 NICOLE
 So, we're stupid now?
 KIMBERLY
 You know, just because you're 
having full-on wiggans doesn't mean 
you have to drag us into it.  This 
isn't just any dance.  It happens 
ot be the last dance of our last 
year.
 NICOLE
 Except for Prom.
 KIMBERLY
 Right.
 JENNIFER
 And Spring Fling.
 KIMBERLY
 Okay.
 NICOLE
 And the January Semi-formal -
KIMBERLY
 Okay!  Look, Buffy.  You want to 
play house with the unwashed 
masses, that's fine.  But 
personally, I think you ought to 
spend a little time prioritizing.  
I really do.
 BUFFY
 Listen to you.  What language are 
you speaking?
 KIMBERLY
 Get out of my facial.
96.
 She storms out.
 NICOLE
 Well, I guess you got what you came 
for.
 BUFFY
 Nicole...
 NICOLE
 Later for it.
 She also leaves, with Jennifer.  Buffy stands alone in the 
room, small amidst the streamers.

 INT. BUFFY'S KITCHEN - EVENING
 CUT TO:
 140
 Buffy stands at the sink, rinsing a glass for way too long, 
staring.  Her mother breezes THROUGH THE FRAME.
 BUFFY'S MOM
 Dinner's in the fridge, stay away 
from the Jag, we'll be back by 
twelve.
 She stops, seems to notice something about Buffy.
 BUFFY'S MOM (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 Buffy, honey?
 BUFFY
 (wanting to talk)
 Yeah?
 BUFFY'S MOM
 Have you gained a few pounds?  
Maybe it's that outfit...
 BUFFY
 Maybe.
 BUFFY'S MOM
 What's Bobby gonna say?
 BUFFY
 I don't know, Mom; I've never met 
Bobby.
97.
 BUFFY'S MOM
 (laughs)
 Aren't we the chatty ones.  Kiss 
noise.
 And she's out.  Buffy looks at her clothes, herself.
 141
 EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - NIGHT
 CUT TO:
 141
 Pike drives slowly between the cars.  He sees Buffy walking 
toward the mall.  He pulls up by her, parks.  Gets out of 
the car.
 PIKE
 Buffy, hey, I've been looking all 
over for you.
 Buffy doesn't stop.  He paces her.
 PIKE (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 I been working on some stuff for 
you.  What'cha doing?
 BUFFY
 I'm going shopping.  Don't try to 
stop me.
 PIKE
 Cool.  I could actually use a 
couple of Allen wrenches.  What do 
you need?
 BUFFY
 A dress.
 PIKE
 Dress, huh?  What for?
 BUFFY
 For the dance.
 PIKE
 Come again?
 BUFFY
 I'm going to the senior dance.
 PIKE
 (charades)
 Second word... sound like 'dance'.
98.
 She stops.
 BUFFY
 I'm going to the dance.
 PIKE
 What for?
 BUFFY
 In order to dance and to drink 
punch and to be with my friends. 
Comprende?
 PIKE
 I don't believe this.  The world's 
under attack by the legions of the 
undead and you're going to a mixer?
 BUFFY
 It's not a mixer.  It's the senior 
dance.  And it's important.  You 
wouldn't understand.
 PIKE
 You got that right.  I thought you 
wanted to kill vampires.
 BUFFY
 I don't want to kill anybody, and I 
don't want to talk about it 
anymore.
 PIKE
 Listen, I know you're bummed about 
your friend, and I'm really 
sorry...
 BUFFY
 (offhand, almost 
disdainful)
 He did what he was supposed to.
 PIKE
 But, Buffy, you're the guy, the 
chosen guy.
 BUFFY
 Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I 
choose to be shopping.
 PIKE
 I should have known.
 Buffy raises her fist at him; he starts back, involuntarily.
99.
 BUFFY
 Leave me alone.
 PIKE
 Benny was right.  You guys are all 
exactly the same.
 Buffy walks away, leaving Pike alone.
 PIKE (CONT’D)
 (continuing; calls after 
her)
 I'm not disappointed, I'm just 
angry.
 As Pike walks off, the camera TILTS UP the lamp post behind 
them.  Benny is perched upon it.
 BUFFY
 Buffy?  Buffy?

 INT. BOILER ROOM - NIGHT

 Vampires are gathered around.  Lothos stands with Benny.  
Benny is beaming.
 LOTHOS

 Lothos laughs, long and hard.

 INT. THE MALL - NIGHT
 CUT TO:

 Buffy looks at dresses, most of them fairly tight and fairly 
out there.  She holds one in front of her, looks in a 
mirror.
 CUT TO:
 144
 INT. ZEPH'S AUTO REPAIR - ANOTHER NIGHT

 Pike sits, fiddling with his crossbow.  Looks out the

shafts, garlic, and a cross.

 INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

 Buffy lays her dress on the bed.  We cannot see exactly what

 Dozens of limos pull up.  Kids pour inside.
 INT. THE GYM - NIGHT
 146
 CUT TO:
 147
 The party is underway.  Streamers everywhere, tables by the 
windows.  Couples dance, a D.J spins the tunes.  There is a 
setup in one corner for taking prom pictures.  The kids are 
all very elegant and hip.  Every shade of black is 
represented.
 ANGLE - PUNCH BOWL
 148
 Nicole and Kimberly stand by the punch bowl, chatting.  They 
are both wearing slinky little black dresses.
 ANGLE - THE DOOR
 149
 There are two: at one end, leading to the house (it's 
closed) and one leading outside.  Gary Murray stands by the 
outside door, on guard, as students enter.  He is looking 
disdainfully at Andy and holding a flask he has confiscated.
 ANDY
 Well, it came with the tux.
 Buffy enters the gym.  She is wearing a long white strapless 
gown.  It is lovely, but very conservative for this crowd. 
Over her shoulder is a purse that goes with the dress.  She 
enters hesitantly, looking around her for Jeffrey.  She 
passes Andy, who is moving away from Gary Murray.
 ANDY (CONT’D)
 Buffy!  Looking tasty.
 BUFFY
 Thanks.  Have you seen Jeffrey?
 But Andy has moved on.  Buffy works her way through the 
crowd to the punch bowl, sees Nicole and Kimberly.  They 
stop whispering real quick.
101.
 BUFFY (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 Hi, guys.
 NICOLE
 Hi.
 BUFFY
 Have you guys seen Jeffrey?  The 
limo never showed, I thought he 
might be here.
 Nicole and Kimberly look at each other significantly.
 NICOLE
 I haven't seen him tonight.
 BUFFY
 Oh.
 She picks up a glass of punch.
 BUFFY (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 I'm glad you guys are here.  It's 
good to see you.
 KIMBERLY
 (miss sarcasm)
 Yeah, whoops I came.
 BUFFY
 (tries again)
 You look way pretty, Kim.
 KIMBERLY
 I know.  I like your little outfit.
 NICOLE
 It's amazing what you can do with a 
parachute and some starch.
 KIMBERLY
 As long as there's room for three 
in it.  What, didn't you bring your 
new friends?
 Buffy is startled by this attack.  Nicole giggles.
 BUFFY
 I guess you guys are mad at me. I'm 
sorry.  I've been really -
102.
 Jeffrey suddenly appears between them.  Jennifer is on his 
arm.
 BUFFY (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 Jeffrey!  There you are.  I -
She stops, as everybody assesses the situation.  Buffy is 
shocked, doing a slow fade to hurt.  Jeffrey is 
uncomfortable. Jennifer is apoplectic with embarrassment.  
Kimberly is in serious giggle, Nicole a bit more restrained, 
checking it out.
 JEFFREY
 Buffy, what are you doing here?
 BUFFY
 I thought we were meeting here.
 JEFFREY
 I'm here with Jenny.-- who is practically hyperventilating, pulling at his arm 
like a dog on a leash.
 BUFFY
 I don't understand.
 JEFFREY
 Oh, come on, Buffy.  You know 
what's going on.  It's not working 
out at all.  I've got to move on.  
I mean, I've got needs, too.  I 
told you about all this.
 BUFFY
 No, you didn't.  When?
 JEFFREY
 Didn't you get my message?
 BUFFY
 You broke up with my machine?
 JEFFREY
 You weren't home.  Like always.
 BUFFY
 You left me a message?
 JEFFREY
 I'm out of here.  Jenny.
103.
 At the mention of her name Jenny jumps, and in her haste to 
get away, she bumps into Buffy's arm, spilling bright red 
punch on Buffy's chest.  She flees, Jeffrey in tow.  They 
leave the gym.  Kimberly finds it all pretty funny.  Nicole 
is silent.
 Buffy turns away, toward the wall.  A soft BALLAD come on 
over the SPEAKERS.  Tears are forming in Buffy's eyes, as 
she wipes futilely at her dress.  Finally she turns, looks 
toward the door.
 BUFFY'S POV
 Pike is there, walking in on his 
own.  He wears a leather jacket and 
baggy old tux pants, accented by 
chains, earring and unlaced Doc 
Martins.  He looks great.
 He walks directly toward Buffy, and does turn a few heads.
 PIKE
 I crashed your party.
 BUFFY
 Pretty shallow of you.
 PIKE
 That's me.
 BUFFY
 I'm glad you came.
 PIKE
 Yeah, you look like you're having a 
swell time.
 Pike picks up a glass of punch as he notices the stain on 
Buffy's dress.  He looks about him a bit, then without 
hesitation dumps some punch on his lapel, matching stains. 
Buffy smiles at him.
 PIKE (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 Will I get the shit kicked out of 
me if I ask you to dance?
 BUFFY
 I don't actually think Jeffrey's 
gonna notice.
 They begin slow dancing, not too close.
104.
 PIKE
 Yeah, well, you're the one I'm 
afraid of.
 They dance for a while, closer and closer.
 PIKE (CONT’D)
 (continuing; gee
whizzically)
 You know, you're not like the other 
girls.
 Buffy pulls him closer, holds him, whispers almost weakly in 
his ear.
 BUFFY
 Yes, I am.
 We see couples dancing, kissing... Gary Murray watching 
them.
 150
 ANGLE - KIMBERLY
 Sitting by the window with her bovine date, she watches 
Buffy dance disdainfully.
 KIMBERLY
 I can't believe it.
 150
 The window SHATTERS by her head, a vampire's hand reaching 
for her.  She screams, starts back.
 Other windows shatter, vampires appearing all around.  A 
couple of students run for the inner door but it is locked 
shut from the other side.
 Gradually the party stops as everybody becomes aware of the 
situation.  They vaguely herd to the middle of the room.
 151
 152
 ANGLE - BUFFY AND PIKE
 Looking around, assessing the situation.
 ANGLE - OUTER DOOR
 151
 152
 A STUDENT runs staggering in, blood spurting from his neck.
 BLOODY STUDENT
 They're out there!  They're 
vampires! God, help me!
 He falls to the ground, a few feet in front of the doorway. 
Nobody moves for a second.  Then one of the students starts 
toward the body.
105.
 BUFFY
 Don't go near the door.
 Buffy does instead, checking the lifeless body and listening 
as a number of figures begin to lumber toward the door 
through the mist.
 Buffy steps back as three 17-year-old vampire come to the 
door.
 153
 VAMPIRE
 It's party time.
 BUFFY
 Don't worry!  They can't come in 
here.  They can't come in unless 
they're invited.
 KIMBERLY
 I already invited them.
 Everyone looks at her.
 KIMBERLY (CONT’D)
 (continuing; defensively)
 They're seniors!
 153
 Pike reaches into an inner pocket and pulls out a number of 
small stakes he has made, hands them to Buffy.  She opens 
her purse.
 154
 155
 156
 157
 ANGLE - INSIDE THE PURSE
 Cosmetics, hair spray, etc.  She fits the stakes in.
 BUFFY
 The first thing we should -
VAMPIRE
 Buffy... You wanna dance?
 PIKE
 (to Buffy)
 Looks like you're busted.
 VAMPIRE
 We want her!  We want Buffy.  Send her out.
 VAMPIRE
 154
 155
 156
 157
 Or we come in.
106.
 They fade back, almost out of sight.  Pike looks out the 
window. More are gathering.
 GARY MURRAY
 All right, everybody stay calm.
 (to Buffy)
 What's going on?
 PIKE
 Looks bad, Buffy.
 SENIOR GIRL
 Send her out.
 BUFFY
 What?
 KIMBERLY
 They'll kill us!  She's the one 
they're mad at.
 SENIOR BOY
 Yeah!  Send her out!
 GARY MURRAY
 Everybody be quiet!
 ANDY
 What, are you kidding?  They'll 
kill her!
 KIMBERLY
 They'll kill us!
 PIKE
 (moving toward Kimberly, 
fist raised)
 You want some punch?
 GARY MURRAY
 I got detention slips here, I'm not 
afraid to use them...
 But other students have picked up the cry, are clamoring to 
sacrifice Buffy.  Pike crosses to his bag, sitting by the 
door.
 Two guys move toward Buffy, Andy intervenes.  Pike steps in 
front of Buffy, holding his custom made cartridge-load 
crossbow. Trains it on the others.  They quiet down.
 PIKE
 There's gotta be a back way out of 
here, or something.
107.
 Buffy looks at the partygoers.  Her friends.  They stare 
back at her, scared, angry.  She looks out the door.  Back 
at her friends.
 BUFFY
 I'm going out the front.
 PIKE
 Are you nuts, Buffy?  There's a 
hundred of them out there.  They'll 
rip us apart.
 BUFFY
 You're staying here.
 (before he can speak)
 Some of them might not come after 
me.  If they don't this place is 
gonna turn into a total stain.
 PIKE
 You say that like it's a bad thing.
 ANDY
 Buffy, this is crazy.  What do 
these guys want?
 BUFFY
 Andy, start breaking up some 
chairs. You'll need weapons.
 Andy looks at her a moment, moves off.  Buffy goes to Pike's 
bag, starts pulling out stakes.
 BUFFY (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 Good thing one of us was prepared.
 PIKE
 Buffy, there's no way you're going 
out there alone.
 Buffy stands up.  She kisses Pike very hard on the lips.
 BUFFY
 Don't piss me off.
 She kneels down, begins to rip the hem of her dress.

 EXT. OUTSIDE THE GYM - NIGHT

 We see the doorway to the gym.  A mist has risen around the 
entire house, swirling about the feet of the undead who 
stand clustered about it.  Some have keen and eager 
expressions, some vacant, half-conscious with bloodlust.  
They wait.
 A figure appears in the doorway, walking slowly out.  Buffy. 
Her torn dress now comes to just above her knees.  She wears 
Pike's leather jacket over it.  She wears her purse strapped 
across her chest under the jacket.  In one hand she holds 
his crossbow; in her other hand is a cross.  As she steps 
further away from the doorway, the vampires slowly begin to 
close around her.
 The door shuts behind her.

 Jeffrey and Jennifer are in the back of his parked BMW,

 JENNIFER
 Oh, yes!  Yes!
 JEFFREY
 Oh, baby!
 JENNIFER
 Make me a woman!  Yes!  Make me a

 As they are spouting this nonsense, Buffy zooms IN and OUT 
OF the FRAME behind the car.  After a second she walks back 
INTO the FRAME, staring at the two of them.

makes it in and is smashed on the head repeatedly by Andy.  
It staggers, smilingly, and turns toward him.
 PIKE
 The heart!  Stab them in the heart!
 Andy manages to shove the two-by-four in its heart just as 
it gets its fingers around his throat.
 Kimberly screams.  One of them has hold of her, starts 
pulling her out the window.  Nicole runs to her, starts 
pulling the vampire's hands off her.  Suddenly, the vampire 
grabs Nicole instead.  Off balance, she is almost out the 
window before Kimberly can react, and all Kim can do is 
scream.  Andy and Pike make it to the window too late; 
Nicole is pulled out, and they swarm over her.

 A junior vampire has snuck behind it and is going through 
the records.  He stops, finding one he likes, and starts to 
put it on.  MUSIC: "Teen Angel".  It wafts over the carnage 
in the gym, lending it a surreal and dreamy quality.
 Hearing the music, another vampire grabs Kimberly and starts 
dancing with her.  She screams a lot.
 It's about to plant one on her neck when Pike stabs it in 
the back.  Pike turns from the dying vampire and is face to 
face with Benny.
 Pike is frozen for a moment.

"Teen Angel" has been replaced by some hard rock.
 BENNY
 Isn't this great, Pike?  Isn't it 
great?  Finally got those bitches 
on the run.
 He hoists Pike up and backhands him in the jaw, sends him 
flying against a wall.  Pike shakes his head as Benny comes 
at him again, no longer smiling.
 BENNY (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 Of course I'm angry!  I leave you 
alone for five minutes, and look 
who you're hanging out with!
 He turns suddenly and grabs a girl, yells in her face.
 BENNY (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 I don't want girls with good taste; 
I want a girl that tastes good!
 She faints and he drops her, turns back to Pike.  Pike is 
getting shakily to his feet.  Blood trickles down his 
forehead.
 BENNY (CONT’D)

 I was gonna change you, man.  I was 
gonna give you life!  Do you know 
what that means?

 Pike is backing away from Benny, who is approaching him.  
Pike passes an overturned table, the stubs of its broken 
legs sticking up at the ceiling.
 BENNY
 Never die.  Never get kicked 
around, never get busted.
 Benny grabs him with hateful force.  His fingers dig into 
Pike's arms enough to draw blood.
 BENNY (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 It means never having to say you're 
sorry!  And you blow it all off for 
that slut?!  What about my needs?!
 Pike suddenly grabs Benny, holds him tightly in a brotherly 
embrace.  Benny is thrown slightly by this.
 Still holding him, Pike pitches onto the table, driving the 
leg-shard through Benny's back.  Pike still holds Benny as 
he twitches and screams, dying.  Finally, he lets go, gets 
up. He looks a little dazed, a little lost.  A window 
shattering far behind him pulls his eyes back into focus, 
and he goes to help.

 Still moving cautiously, she heads for the window and pulls 
down the shade.  She crouches behind the teacher's desk and 
pulls the chair down to her, laying it on its side.
 BENNY
 (cattily, to herself)
 'Ooh, make me a woman, Jeffrey... 
oh, Jeffrey, you're so 
atheletical... I love you...'
 She slams her elbow down on the chair leg -- very 
controlled, efficient motion -- and snaps it off.  Looks 
around to see if anyone is around to hear as she picks up 
the leg, now a weapon.
 She goes softly to the door, peers cautiously out.

 CLOSEUP - BUFFY
 183
 Looking out.  Amilyn's face appears right next to her, also 
looking out.
 AMILYN
 All clear?
 Buffy screams, turns, and Amilyn decks her, sends her flying 
back into the classroom.  The stake flies out of her hand.  
It lands on a desk by the window.
 Buffy does not land nearly as well, crashing into a pile of 
desks and twisting her leg badly.  Amilyn laughs 
repulsively, advancing.
 AMILYN (CONT’D)
 Pleased to meet you!  Won't you 
guess my -
(kicks her hard)-- name?
 BUFFY
 (defiantly, through the 
pain)
 It wouldn't be 'Dick,' would it?
 He kicks her again.
 BUFFY (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 'Lefty'?
116.
 AMILYN
 You're a fool, bloodbag.  Die a 
fool and go to hell!
 He grabs her by the neck with his one arm and pins her 
against the wall in the corner.  She reaches for the stake 
but it is just out of reach.  He is squeezing the life out 
of her, his face inches from hers.
 AMILYN (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 The chosen one.  You're just 
another bloodbag -- not even fit to 
die for the Master.  When will you 
ever learn?
 Buffy looks about for succor.

 Buffy eyes the bottom of the shade, the pull dangling 
aimlessly.
 BUFFY

 I do know... one thing...
 AMILYN
 What?
 BUFFY
 I know... what time sunrise is.
 She pulls down hard on the shade pull and lets go.
 AMILYN
 No!
 184
 He turns in horror, letting go of Buffy, trying to catch the 
shade.  The instant he releases her, Buffy grabs the stake 
and in one swift motion, buries it in Amilyn's back.
 The shade goes up, flapping loudly as it spins.  It is still 
pitch black out.  Amilyn stare, wide-eyed and silent, at the 
night as he dies.
 BUFFY
 It's in about four hours, Dick.
 Amilyn spins, dying rage in his eyes.  He grabs her.  His 
strength is formidable even as his body begins to smoke.

 Suddenly screaming, he forces her over suddenly with such 
power that the two of them go crashing through the 
floorboards.

 The two of them fall through the ceiling directly into the 
blood pool.
 Amilyn's body surfaces first, now just a husk.
 Buffy pops up from the waist-deep blood, soaked and wounded. 
She stays a moment, breathing hard.  Suddenly her eyes go 
wide.
 BUFFY
 Oh, god, no... not yet...
 Lothos rises from the pool, smiling.  Buffy is clearly 
paralyzed by fear.
 LOTHOS
 I knew you'd come.
 He moves toward her.
 LOTHOS (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 You knew it, too, didn't you?  All 
your life, dreaming... waiting to 
feed me.
 Buffy is suddenly galvanized into action.  She throws a few 
punches at Lothos, but he takes them without flinching.  She 
grabs at the stake in what remains of Amilyn's chest.  
Lightning quick, Lothos closes his hand around her and 
squeezes till the stake splinters and she screams with pain.  
He knocks her back on her ass.
 She starts moving backward, away from him, but it is hard 
enough for her to make her way through the thick gore.  
Lothos contemplates Amilyn's corpse, and his face darkens.
 LOTHOS (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 Ah, my fool is dead.  He was 
careless, always.  Still, I'll pull 
out your tongue for that.
 (coming toward her)
 Don't you understand?  I've killed 
you a dozen times.  
(MORE)
118.
 LOTHOS (CONT’D)
 Your life is not a blink of my eye, 
not a single breath.  I have lived 
in the shadows, in the pulsing 
filth behind men's eyes.  A 
thousand years, and more. I have 
conversed with the worms that fed 
on my corpse and I have bathed in 
the blood of emperors.
 BUFFY
 (breaking the spell)
 Have you ever thrown up in the 
front row of a Richard Marx 
concert?
 LOTHOS
 What?
 And she is up, turning to run.  He is thrown momentarily by 
her insolence.

 But he is on her the moment she emerges from the chamber, 
grabbing her by the hair and throwing her to the ground.
 LOTHOS
 You waste time.  That is a sin.
 He kneels over her prostrate body.  She is reaching 
frantically into her purse.  He runs his hand along her 
body, a gesture both lustful and disdainful.
 LOTHOS (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 You're even weaker than the others.
 BUFFY
 I think you've forgotten something.
 She pulls out a small cross, holds it in front of him.  He 
snarls at it, then grabs it, his hand around her.  The cross 
bursts into flame.  He holds her hand onto it.
 LOTHOS
 This?  This is you only weapon? 
Your puny faith?
 BUFFY
 No...
 With her other hand, Buffy holds up her hair spray.
119.
 BUFFY (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 ... my keen fashion sense.
 She squeezes it at him, the spray catching fire form the 
cross and whooshes a jet of flame right into his face.  He 
screams, letting her go and backing up.  Hey, his head is on 
fire!
 Buffy turns and hobbles away.

Everything stops.  For a moment there is silence.
 Buffy gets shakily up.

in!
 Pike and the others see her.  Pike and Andy run to her to 
help.
 KIMBERLY (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 They'll kill us!  Get her out!
 Gary Murray stops in front of Kimberly, takes her face in 
his hand and lightly pops the back of her head against the 
wall. Cross-eyed, she slides back down into comatic silence.
 PIKE
 Are you okay?
 BUFFY
 Get away from me!
 She pushes them away.  Lothos crashes through the trap door 
behind her, ugly and crazed.  He picks her up, floating a 
good two feet off the ground.
 LOTHOS
 You bitch!
 He hurls her the length of the room.  She hits a locker, 
which opens, spilling out someone's notebook.  The binder 
falls open, inside it is a plastic pen case with pens and 
pencils within.
 Buffy looks, by this time, like shit.  She props herself up 
as best she can, looks about her.  There is nothing wooden, 
nothing sharp, within reach.
 LOTHOS (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 You would challenge me?
121.
 Andy charges Lothos from behind.  Pike tries to stop him, 
but is too late, as Lothos grabs him by the face without 
even looking at him.
 LOTHOS (CONT’D)
 (continuing; to Buffy)
 I'll rip the flesh from your 
stinking bones!
 Squeeze Andy's head until we hear something crack.  Lets him 
drop.  Looks around at the cowed students.
 LOTHOS (CONT’D)
 (continuing)
 I am a God!  A God!
 BUFFY
 I am so sure.
 Lothos roars.  Furious, he charges Buffy, his feet just 
skimming the ground, racing toward her, violently fast, upon 
her...
 She spins, on her feet in a flash, one quick motion.  She 
thrusts her palm forward and stops him, cold, like Superman 
stopping a train, palm at his chest.
 Silence.  Buffy looks directly into his eyes, the mad rictus 
of his face.
 Lothos stops, almost wide-eyed, as he looks down at his 
chest.
 Sticking out of the middle of his chest is a small eraser, 
and a #2.
 He steps back, staring at Buffy.  The expression on his 
horrible face seems to have changed to one almost of 
respect.  Her look is unfathomable.
 Lothos smiles, graciously.
 LOTHOS
 It doesn't... hurt... as much as I 
had imagined.
 He falls gently to the ground.  He's dust before he hits it.
 Silence.  One by one the vampires, stricken, slip out into 
the night.

 GARY MURRAY
 Just a minute, you!  I'm not

 Pike kneels by the pile of dust with a pencil in it.

 The death toll now reaches twelve

High School.  It was at the Senior 
Prom five days ago that the school 
was beset by a roving gang of crack- 
crazed gunmen.  Survivors say some 
two hundred of the ruffians laid 
the school gym under a kind of

 Buffy leads the way.  She is confident, at ease.  She wears 
a large old sports jacket, a baseball cap pulled backward.  
Skirt and sneakers.  Casual, cool, but disarming.  She 
carries a knapsack.
 PIKE
 I didn't say it was a bad idea, I
