How many is that now?

You need to call him a taxi.

I'm not trying to be mean.

It's that old guy again.

Should you let the manager know?

The guy hasn't done anything. That's how it is with creeps, right up until the day that they decide to do something.

He's probably harmless.

Nobody's harmless, especially a male nobody.

Excuse me. Can I sit down?

You're allowed to sit wherever you'd like.

Thank you. What would you like to drink?

A soda water...with lemon.

Please cut it in half.

That's $1. Thank you.

Here.

Have anything smaller than that?

All my bills are that size.

I'll get you your change.

During my prior visits to this establishment, you were tending the bar. Do you really enjoy that work?

When the customers are respectful, I do.

But... you have ambitions, don't you?

That's not any of your business.

Perhaps I'm mistaken --

I am from Europe and do not know all of these local customs -- but I thought that the primary responsibility of a bartender is to serve and engage the customers in a conversation.

Is companionship something that you offer?

Make one more insinuation, and I'll have you thrown out.

Cheers.

So, where are you from in Europe?

I am from France.

My father is French, and my mother is German.

But I lived in many places.

Well, I don't know how things are back there, but in this country, people don't wear hats when they sit down someplace to have a drink.

So, you want me to take my hat off?

L'm letting you know the customs, since you're such a respectful guy.

Tell me something.

Are you an acquaintance of hers?

Bartender? The man here wants to know if we're acquainted.

Disgusting h*m*.

Mind if I turn it down a bit? Too loud?

No. I just want to talk about something.

What's on your mind?

Well...what we talked about last week.

Having a baby? Yeah.

I think --

I think now would be the perfect time.

Me too.

Did you hear that?

It came from the back.

Aaaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaah!

Harrow, come take a look at this.

Maybe like a-a raccoon, when it stands on its hind legs, begging for scraps?

I'll call it in.

Get ready for something different.

Freeze!

Hello, Dad.

You letting yourself go?

What? That stain on your face.

I'm, um... working on a beard.

Thought I'd try a new look.

Well, you might want to remove some of that jewelry you got on.

It's dated.

I do not remember putting that on.

Eddy!

Mom. How are you?

L'm fine. I'm fine.

That's good. Yeah.

You look well. Don't patronize him.

L'm not. Divorce can be very hard to go through, and I think you look very well, especially when you consider...

I cleaned up your old room.

Any idea how long you intend to stay?

Well, I'm gonna look for apartments when I'm off work this weekend, so I don't think very long.

I'd like that in writing. You are a delight.

Are you feeling sorry for yourself, coming in here, going through his stuff, wallowing?

Dad, if you don't want me here, just say so, but Mom invited me, okay?



You've been at your worst since I got here, and, also, your best is... not great, so...

Yeah, your lecture would have had a lot more impact if you weren't holding a doll in your hands.

You know what? I can -- I can just go stay at Markowitz's...

No, no, no, no, no, no.

Your mom wants you here, it's fine by me.

Okay. Any of that stuff valuable?

That box has just been sitting in that closet forever.

Well, you wanna sell it on the computer, keep the cash.

No. I don't think I'd sell any of this stuff, no.

All right. Up to you.

Home by 7:00, you can have dinner with us.

If not, we'll set something aside for you.

Thanks. You know, I was disappointed when I found out you and Jennifer separated.

I really thought she'd make a good mother.

And she was a real good looker, too...

...especially for a guy who... works in a comic-book store and draws.

L'm sure that was supposed to come out nicer.

Yeah.

Hey.

That'll be $12.

L've got $9.85. Can you do some type --

No, no, no, no, no, no. No charity, okay?

If you don't have enough, you can steal from your mommy like everybody else.

You're a jerk-off. Perhaps I am, yes, but that does not diminish the value of my advice to you.



You want me to hold these back here or put them back on the shelves?

You can hold them.

You drawing anything new these days?

No, not really.

You should do more Madame Lightning.

Maybe. She's hot.

I think you should work on something new.

Yeah, I will. I just, um --

I've been very...

Distracted.

You've been pretty distracted. Yeah, I have been.

Eddy Easton? Yeah?

Do you remember me?

I'm Ashley -- Ashley Summers.

My God. Mike's little sister.

Yeah. You remember. Wow.

I know I looked kind of different before, but...

Are you still over there? Yeah.

But it's just me now.

Mike's in the Coast Guard. I don't know if he told you.

And my parents moved to Florida, so...

Sorry.

Am I interrupting you? I -- No, I was -- No, this --

I was looking at the old thing

'cause, um, honestly, work was bad, and the idea of having dinner with my parents right now is...

You wanna join us for a walk around the block?

You're walking a cat.

Hypothetically. Yeah.

So, what are you doing now? -l'm getting a sociology degree and working at a record shop.

Cool. I love records.

I mean, when they first came out, we called them "records," before they were "vinyl," when hipster douchebags just made them to seem all retro.

Yeah. But, honestly, I'd probably agree with any statement that contained the phrase

"hipster douchebags."

Sorry. So... will Rhonda get jealous if I ask you for your number?

Yes. Okay.

But she can deal.

Hello.

Do you want to go to the auction?

sh*t!

Jesus..

Mnh.

f*ck.

sh*t.

Well, you definitely seem like a toy that a maniac would make.

Don't stab or hook anything.

Do you guys remember where you got that puppet for James, the, um, creepy one with the, - the skull face and the hat?

I don't. Do you?

We didn't actually buy that for James.

He found it when he was at sleepaway camp.

I would never have bought him something like that.

He really wanted to keep it, so we let him.

Where was his sleepaway camp? Postville.

You know, this used to be better before he could fly...

-...back when he leapt over stuff.

Why? Because jumping hundreds of feet in the air is a logical extrapolation of superhuman strength, right?

Whereas flying displays a flagrant disregard for the laws of physics, okay?



Unless his body was somehow magnetically opposed to the Earth or somehow magnetically attracted to the sun, which is ridiculous.

He's just too powerful if he can fly.

Yeah, but -- but he's also bulletproof.

So, what's the difference? He's b*llet-resistant.

Hey! Hi.

Hi.

You must be Ashley. I am. And you're Markowitz?

Are you impressed? Just don't even -- don't even engage him. That's the best thing to do.

Just -- Okay.

Yeah, just look over here, so...

What's this? You going somewhere?

Um, I was actually thinking about going to that convention at the end of the month.

Cool. My God. Do you wanna go?

To a convention celebrating a bunch of sick murders that happened 30 years ago?

Things like that exemplify absolutely everything that's wrong with our society.

So, that's a yes? Yeah.

Cool. Okay. I figured you'd want to.

You okay there? Don't look at him.

L'm sorry. I just --

I get this really weird cough when I'm not invited to things.

It's a... You wanna come to the convention? No.

My God, I would love to join you two. Thank you.

That was not an official invitation, okay?

You gonna un-invite me?

Your very close friend and tolerant employer?

Okay, if you're gonna come, just a couple rules. Ready?

There's no eating in the car.

There's no drinking in the car. There's no smoking in the car.

There's no black metal in the car, no thrash metal, no death metal.

What about -- No grindcore.

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. And you're paying for gas.

Hold on a second, Genghis McHitler.

You're gonna make me follow all these rules and then also pay for gas?

These are my terms. They are non-negotiable.

Do you still want to come?

Yes, I do, although now it's mostly just to spite you.

That's fine.

Hey, Ashley, do you know any another 7 1/2s that you could maybe --

I mean, I would go as low as, like, a 7 or a very skilled 61/2.

This is grindcore.

You heard about it your whole life.

This is it.

Very good. Carry on, driver.

It was your brother's, right -- the puppet?

Yeah, he, - he found it at sleepaway camp the summer before his... accident.

L'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring up anything sad.

No, no.

Look, we're -- we're selling one of James's toys.

It's bound to come up.

You know, grindcore would help us avoid this topic.

Also, - I don't know -- toplessness?

But you're only an A-cup.

Maybe a B.

Might you try being polite to you boyfriend's boss, Sugarbat?

.HGy-

No nicknames for Blondie here.

Okay?

Fine, Mussolini.

You wanna...

Nice.

Enjoy your stay.

Hi. Welcome to the Brass Buckle.

You here for the convention?

Yes, we are. Yeah. Perfect.

What names are your reservations under?

There's two. One's under, Easton.

One's under Markowitz.

You must be Markowitz.

Why? 'Cause I look like a Jew?

Are you Markowitz? Yes.

Then there's nothing to be upset about, now, is there?

All right, here's this.

Please, if you could just -- Thank you.

Sign right here.

Okay. Thank you very much.

Right there. Thank you. Okay.

There's one key, and your second key.

Okey.

You're all checked in -- 102 and the other one.

Um, I'm Howie, if you need anything.

And these pamphlets right here have the entire convention schedule on them.

Also, there's a coupon to the Toulon Mansion Tour, if you'd like to go.

There's one more today at 5:30.

Thanks, Howie.

Thank you. Enjoy your stay.

It's good. Yeah.

Let's do this. Okay.

Wait. Aren't we meeting Markowitz in like 10 minutes?

We'll do it twice, then.

Aah. Twice?

Not bad for a comic-book guy.

Remind me your name.

You're an idiot.

I wasn't able to find you a 7 1/2...

...or a skilled 6.

But, I appreciate you sharing Edgar with me.

L'm happy to. Thanks.

Who knows? I might be able to pick up a rural 7 1/2 in the hotel bar.

It is very depressing in there. It might give me the edge.



Hey, have you, um -- you checked out Madame Lightning yet --

You know, the comic Edgar did?

No. I mean, not yet. Of course, I will, but...

You should. It's really good. Yeah.

Yeah. I'm sure it's great.

Let's get started, shall we?

My name is Carol Doreski, and I'll be your tour guide this evening.

I'm a retired police officer who was part of the team that raided this mansion 30 years ago.

Yes, I was one of the shooters.

Andre Toulon -- note the pronunciation -- was born in Paris, France, in 1907.

Not much is known about his life in Europe, though from a very early age, he was involved with the family business.



That was manufacturing, selling, and performing with puppets.

We had three of his puppets in that display case over there... before they got stolen.

And this is one of only two surviving photographs of Les Fantoches Magiques de Toulon.

Translated, that means

"The Magical French Puppets of Toulon."

Now, Andre Toulon was imprisoned in Paris for three years in the late 1920s and twice for shorter durations in Norway and Luxembourg.

After his third incarceration, Toulon moved to Germany, where he remained until shortly after the w*r.

Somebody fled to Germany?

During his time in the Fatherland, Toulon resumed his puppet show.

Blueprints for this mansion and bars of gold were sent from Germany to the Unites States by Toulon as World w*r ll turned in favor of the Allies.

Four weeks after Germany surrendered, Toulon, along with his wife, Madeline, boarded an ocean liner bound for the United States.

It was during this journey that Mrs. Toulon jumped from the ship and committed suicide.

The walls of this chamber are soundproof.

On the day that the police entered the premises, these four cots were occupied by women.

Three of them were alive, but in terrible shape.

Their...

...eyes had been gouged out, and their bodies were covered with burns and lacerations.

All of them were insane.

And the two who were eventually identified... were both Jewish.

Note the holes in the middle of the mattresses and the drain on the floor below them.



It appears the w*r did not end in Germany for Andre Toulon.

The swastika in the center is more than eight feet tall.

Actually, when I grew up in Germany, we never said "swastika." We said "Hakenkreuz."

You have anything else you wanna add, since you're the expert?

Is that a... "nein"?

Follow me downstairs.

This is a partial collection of Andre Toulon's extensive library.

In total, the library has volumes on biology, astrology, numerology, eschatology, and demonology, among other more esoteric subjects.

These were written in 38 different languages, not including the papyrus scrolls in that case over there, which are in two languages yet to be identified.

Yes, we checked the Internet.

Now, I'd like you to pay close attention to the volumes prominently displayed in the case.

These are from the private library of Adolf Eichmann.



Eichmann is credited with organizing the "Final Solution."

It sounds like Toulon deserved worse than what he got.

You're quite right, my friend.

This cellar workshop is where Andre Toulon manufactured puppets for his mail-order business.

It is unclear how many of these puppets were made and sent around the United States, Europe, and Asia, though 60 or so of them are expected to be in Postville by tomorrow for the auction.

This room... is where we found Andre Toulon... on the day that we forced our way inside.

Toulon... raised his g*n, which was a Luger.

And we shot him... four times.

He fell to the ground and died without... taking a single shot.

I've often wondered -- maybe he wanted to be ex*cuted.

At least, I hope so.

Andre Toulon's body was claimed by a distant relative and laid to rest in that mausoleum.

What are the rods coming out of the -- the top?

No one's really sure.

Speculation is that it has some sort of occult significance.

His library was full of that stuff.

Because they don't go with the rest of the architecture, you know?

No, I guess they don't.

Well, this is the end of the tour.

Feel free to look around for a few more minutes and ask me any additional questions.

Cool. Thank you.

You guys need a jump?

Thanks, but I already tried that.

I'm not sure what could be wrong with it.

Good luck.

Hey, there's one right there. Right there.

Hi.

Sorry. We probably knocked it over when we were rushing earlier.

Think somebody who works here took him?

I think that a lot of very valuable collectibles all arrived in a small town at the same time and I was a f*cking moron to trust a hotel lock.

Hello? Yeah. Hi. Hi.

This is Edgar Easton, and I'm in 336. Um...

Rester dans I'ombre.

.Yes?

Hello? Hello? H-Hello?

Hello, sir? Hello. Hi --

Yes, yes, this is Edgar Easton. Sorry.

There was some interference on the line.

Yeah, I'm -- I'm in 336.

Something of mine is, stolen.

Okay. I'll -- I'll -- I'll see what I can do.

.Ok3Y-

Did that voice say, "Rester dans I'ombre"?

I think so, yes.

Why? What does that mean?

It's French. It means, "Remain in the shadows."

Something just went under the bed.

Like what? A cockroach? A mouse?

Bigger.

Jason. Yeah?

Our Kaiser's gone. You know where it is?

Yeah. Hold on a sec.

He's down here.

How'd he get over there?

I don't know. Housekeepers, I guess.

Well, after what we saw today in the Toulon Mansion, I wouldn't have minded if it got stolen.

Having something like that makes me really uncomfortable.

Lots of Jewish people collect n*zi memorabilia -- medals, pamphlets, posters, stuff like that.

My Uncle Shelley does.

W . here d this guy go?

Is it to remind him of what happened back then?

It's a reminder, sure, but there's also a feeling of empowerment there, you know?

Like saying to the Nazis, "Your big plans of genocide and world domination didn't work, and now your symbols are nothing more than trinkets for us to collect, souvenirs of your failure and our survival."

Aaaaaaaaaah!

Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

Hang it up in the closet.

There.

You ever worked at a strip club?

No.

You could.

And that's supposed to be a compliment?

I bet you don't have any tan lines.

I was right.

Aaaah! Aaaah! f*ck!

What the f*ck are you doing?!

f*ck! What the f*ck?!

sh*t. What the f*ck?

[Man gasps 1

David Starr starts in Toronto with the superkick to the face.

What elevation on that...

k*ll the bastard son of a b*tch!

-...nearly jumped out of the building!

This is lucha libre rules...

Total bullshit, man!

Although not spent a lot of time in Mexico, maybe not super familiar with lucha libre rules.

David Starr not endearing himself to this wrestling crowd.

Another beer?

Bartender?

What do you want from the Cuddly Bear?

I want to buy that woman a drink. What's she having?

Tea.

Need a moment to figure your strategy, cuz?

I'd like to have a tea bag of whatever she's having.

This will just take a few seconds.

No rush.

Okay.

I would like you to deliver this tea bag to the bookish blonde over there.

Cuddly Bear can do that.

From the tall gentleman at the end.

Want another martini?

Yeah. And I think I might order some food, too.

All right. Nerissa, wants to order.

How much would it cost me to, drop a laxative in the bookish blonde's drink?

'$750.

That is a very high and specific price.

Cuddly Bear don't wanna hurt nobody, even a hater, but Mrs. Cuddly Bear wants herself a new hi-def  TV.

Cuddly Bear's got principles, but he also got priorities.

Markowitz. Cuddly Bear.

Yeah. I heard. Hey, have a drink on me.

Thanks, cuz.

I'll be right back for your order.

Thank you. Wait, wait, wait. Wait a second.

Is that an Empress Asayuki pin you're wearing?

You know Empress Asayuki? I have every manga and DVD.

Well, good to know. I'll be back very soon.

Postville P.D.

Edgar Easton?

You're the one that reported your doll missing, correct?

I did. And it's a puppet.

Is she with you?

Yes, she is. Name?

Ashley Summers.

Your girlfriend? we're dating. Right?

Yeah. Yeah.

Did she know about the doll, what it was worth?

She did.

I-l don't understand what that has to do with anything.

When did you first tell her about the doll?

I don't understand what that has to do with anything.

You don't have to understand. Just tell me -- when did you first tell her about the doll?

I don't know. A little over a week ago, maybe.

Was that before or after you two first had intercourse?

None of your business.

No, it's my business because -- Edgar told me about the puppet exactly one week after we'd had intercourse for the first time.

We did it 3 more times that day and approximately

11 more times the following week.

Need any other stats, Gramps?

No, you told me more than plenty.

Now, when did you first notice your doll missing?

Please don't say, "Doll."

And if you saw it, I swear you would never say "doll."

-lt's a doll. It's a doll.

Ma' "1?

Ma'am, Postville P.D. Do you speak English?

Yeah, I do. Of course. Yeah.

So, what's all the commotion?

Well, someone stole my puppets.

How many puppets do you have? Five of them.

And two were in near-mint condition.

Five puppets?

This incident is starting to turn into a happening.

Mom, I just want to take some time and re-evaluate things, you know, not rush into anything like I did last time.

Yeah, and the gallery is taking up plenty of my attention now.

No, not once since New Year's, not even a little sip.

Thanks.

It was hard at first, but, now I don't even miss it.

Yeah, except maybe a little bit at openings.

Yeah, well, we'll see.

There's at least eight others that are up for auction, and the condition of mine -- you know, it isn't the best.

I'm hoping to get like $3,000 for it, maybe $2,000.

Okay. Yeah.

Go enjoy your bridge game. Say hi to Betty for me.

Bye, Mom. Bye, Mom.

Yeah!

Okay, here it comes. Yes, Jonathan --

-...sleeping on one of my friends' couch for a while.

Anne? Was that you?

-...maybe my new boss would let me stay here between shifts.

Anne, you making that noise?

Hey. You fall asleep, babe?

Anne!

What the f*ck? Babe!

f*ck! f*ck! What -- Babe!

What the f*ck happened to you?!

Hey, wanna go to a strip club?

You're a genius.

Totally. You're a genius.

You already forgot about the strip club, didn't you?

Nah, man. Nah, I didn't forget.

You see those things?

What things?

The three little guys that just ran under the van.

That sounds "doobie-ous."

Howie, I'm gonna need the first and last name of every guest in the hotel, okay?

.Ok3Y-

What are you looking so nervous about?

The police make me nervous. Where were you --

Brown.

What?

That's unbelievable. Where?

All right. I'm on my way with the hotel manager.

What's that? What's going on?

Just, um -- There's --

My God.

Hello?

What? Both of them? The Gottliebs?

I'll -- I'll -- I'll -- I'll -- I'll tell the police.

Just keep the door shut and don't touch anything, okay?

Detective Brown, two more bodies were...found by housekeeping.

We should leave. Yeah, we should go.

We really -- Yeah. Okay. Get the stuff. Get your stuff.

Hold on a sec. What is that?

Edgar -- I just -- I --

Wait right there. I wouldn't, um... go in there.

-...eagerly awaiting to see if there's a new DDT lronman.

Ironman heavyweight. Heavymetalweight.

Heavymetal championship. How dare he forget that?

No!

And a dip lock! He's so strong.

Has he flipped anybody as big as Moose?

Hey, Howie!

There's a lot of blood down here!

Dete-- Detective Brown? Detective Brown?

We need you out here, please. This is...

What now? I-I don't know. Just --

Just -- Just come this way.

Who's staying in this room?

Hezekiah Buckland.

Hezekiah?

Hezekiah Buckland -- what kind of name is that?

It's a gypsy name. I Googled it.

These are hate crimes, Detective.

A gypsy, a lesbian, and a Jewish couple have all been m*rder*d. Somebody is very clearly --

Please let me do my job, all right? This is my job.

Howie, I want every guest in the hotel downstairs in the lobby of the convention center right now.

Attendance is mandatory. Yeah.

If they're not dead, they're suspects.

Walker, you know the drill. Tape off the room.

Nobody gets in.

Come on, Howie. Let's go.

Edgar, what's happening? Hi.

Um, we're gonna text Markowitz and see if he's okay. Okay.

Have you ever been to Dallas before?

Um, twice. I-l liked it there, but it was pretty expensive.

Well, not if you know the right spots to hit and, um, have a place to stay.

You didn't hide it from me. What?

Your password. Most people hide it from me.

My last boyfriend did.

Well...l trust you.

And, plus, Empress Asayuki is a woman of honor, is she not?

Yeah. Yeah, she is.

No, no.

Okay. I got to tell you, this is just technically fan fiction, but I prefer it significantly to, like, the last two or three theatrical releases.

Here.

That's cool. Yeah.

You're selling one at the auction?

Discover more

One what?

That's not mine.

Actually, I don't really know how that got here.

Maybe it walked.

Looks like somebody ripped off one of his arms.

This one doesn't have any hair, either.

I don't think this Edgar's.

This is the police department!

Every single person is required to go down to the lobby right now!

This is an emergency!

Everybody go downstairs!

.Ok3Y-

Everybody go downstairs right now!

Snag a jacket, love.

Who knows how long this will take?

I thought you gonna keep me warm.

Don't stall.

This one?

Hurry, love.

Aaah! Aaah!

I'm gonna text him again.

Okay. Actually, no. Wait.

Look.

Hey. Markowitz, hey. Finally.

Hey, I'm glad you're okay.

Hi. Sorry.

Is everybody -- Can everybody hear me?

Fuckin' cop's looking right at me.

We should fuckin' leave.

This is Detective Brown from the Postville Police Department.

He's going to explain what's happening here.

Um...Detective Brown?

Okay. Now, as many of you already know, there's been multiple cases of theft and m*rder at the Brass Buckle this evening.

The police department is here to investigate those crimes, and we're gonna have to interview each and every one of you before the night is over.

We'd like to prioritize anyone who may have witnessed --

Detective, do you think it's safe for us to be here, given the circumstances?

Hold all questions until I'm through.

No one's leaving the building unless authorized by the police department, and that's not going to happen in the near future, so --

What? What?

You got backup power? Yeah, we should.

Okay, now, in the event of a power failure, the backup generator will kick in, so we won't be left in the dark.

Now, does anybody think he or she may have seen something --

It isn't safe for us to stay here.

I mean, there have been murders and thefts and other --

No one is leaving this building until the police have completed their investigation.

Get the doors.

And from now on, anyone who interrupts me will be charged with obstruction.

You can't lock us in.

Stay where you are!

Do not attempt to leave the building!

Run!

Stop!

Doreski, stand down!

Come on.

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

Hey! Travis! Open the door! Travis!

What are you doing?!

L'm trying -- I'm trying to start --

Start the f*cking caaaaaaaaar! -lt's not working!

What the f*ck?! My God!

"No!

Now I know what k*lled my brother.

Kid! Come on!

Come on!

We got to go in.

Stay behind the Cuddly Bear. Hold on to my silk tight.

Kid!

[ Gasps 1 These doors are staying shut.

Everyone, come.

Let's regroup in here. We got to make a plan.

I think we can defend ourselves better in the Easy Comfort.

Fine. Let's regroup in the Easy Comfort, then.

Stick with him. I have to get something.

Everybody should take one of these so we know what we're up against.

You're saying a puppet k*lled little cuz, a g*dd*mn toy?

I know it sounds insane, but we all saw what we saw in the parking lot.

Some of us did more than just see these things.

This is crazy.

We've called for police assistance, the two nearest towns, but they're not gonna be here for at least two hours.

Two hours?

f*ck. Double f*ck.

Right. So we're gonna have to figure out a way to defend ourselves right now.

Anybody have any idea how this is happening, how these puppets are doing what they're doing?

All right.

Then we catch one and figure out how it works.

You and your blue buddies seem to be the only ones with the g*ns.

Yeah, and that's a good thing, considering the terrible judgment some of you have exercised so far.

So, we catch one, we take it apart, we figure out how it works, how to stop it, how to k*ll it.

Any idea as to how many there might be?

-63 were to be auctioned off tomorrow, so maybe 40, 45?

Biscuits!

Okay. The next logical question is, "Why?"

Because they're Nazis.

Think about it.

They've targeted a Jewish couple, a gay woman, a gypsy, and they were made by a guy who worked for the Third Reich.

I don't think that's a coincidence.

They were attacking pretty indiscriminately in the parking lot. Okay, well, that's different.

That's -- That's when people were trying to flee and they were fighting back so they were just pissed.

Why would a guy like "Too-lon" --

-lt's "Toulon."

Why would anybody create a n*zi puppet?

Because a puppet would be a very good spy.

They're little. They're fast.

They can go around unnoticed, find undesirables, okay?

If Anne Frank was hiding in your attic, a puppet could find her.

What do you mean, like a bloodhound?

Exactly, except one that you would give to a kid for their birthday.

What exactly do you do, Mr. Easton?

I write and draw comic books.

And that makes you an authority on this?

n*zi puppets?

I have an imagination.

I also have an as*h*le cop for a father, so this whole bit doesn't intimidate me.

Why now? Why here, Mr. -- Mr. Comic Book?

I don't know. I don't know.

But I happen to think that you're right.

We have to catch one, take it apart.

I'll do it. My great-grandfather -- he had the numbers on his arm.

The stories that he told us...

lf these n*zi puppets want a Jew, then I'll be the bait, okay?

But you got to promise me that after we find out what we need to know, that you will let me k*ll the fucker.

You have a plan?

You got a menorah in storage?

Markowitz, stay back.

f*ck!

Come on, kid. Go! Out! Grab that puppet!

Okay. This one's called Mechaniker.

Yeah. That's German for "mechanic."

Thank you. I think we could've figured that out.

This purple thing -- what is this, a -- a hard drive, a motor?

What the hell activated it?

Maybe it's something local.

Like what?

Aaaah !

Scheisse. sh*t.

sh*t.

It's Junior Fuerher.

All right, all right, all right, all right.

k*ll that f*cking baby!

Nice shot. Thanks.

I think he's dead. Yeah.

Give me that f*cking thing.

Let's see how you like it.

Get behind me.

I-I got a first-aid kit in the office.

Yeah, come out of there. Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

We got to hide somewhere else. Okay, everyone, go up to a room or an office.

Seal it up till help comes, 'cause what happened in that parking lot is about to happen in here.

Let's go.

Okay, wait here. No, no, no, I'm armed.

I should -- No, no, no, no. I'll go first.

Take this. Get -- Get -- Get back.

sh*t.

Check everywhere.

Nothing. There's nothing.

Shh, shh.

H-Hello?

Someone help me?

Shouldn't we help her?

I just think that going outside right now is not a good idea.

So we're just gonna let her die?

There's a pretty big pile of dead people right outside of that door right now, okay?

If the puppets find out where we are, it's over.

Sh'ma Yisra'eil, Adonai El--

What is she saying?

She's saying the Shema, which is the prayer that Jews say before they die.

g*dd*mn these fucks, these f*cking Nazis.

All right, that's it. Give me the g*n.

You can't go out there. No.

What I can't do is just sit here and let this happen to us again.

You changed your mind because she's Jewish?

Why?

I got about six million reasons why.

I'm not gonna fight you on this one, all right?

I'm going out there, armed or not.

.L-ley... let's do this. What?

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

Take this. Just -- Just take it.

Thank you. Edgar.

Hey... don't shoot Markowitz, okay?

_$Qfl'y.

Sh'ma Yisra'eil, Adonai El--

Elo-- Eloheinu.

.[ Gasps 1

f*ck it!

Guys? Guys?

Guys?

Aaaaaaaaah !

My God. All right.

Yep. Got you.

All right.

It's about time I woke up from this dream.

Yeah. We all should.

What about the woman?

We were too late.

"No!

g*n!

Buddy, buddy, buddy.

Open the window and jump down.

Dedicate your next comic to me... to a great...

Jewish hero.

Shalom, amigo.

Goodbye.

Nerissa... do you think you would have s-slept with me?

You know, if I'd, like, took you to some nice restaurants and didn't say anything too s-stupid?

-60% chance.

That's good to know.

Wow. We need to jump.

It's our best option -- unless you think we should go up.

L'm sorry.

You okay?

Nerissa, we got to go! Come on!

Come on!

Check for keys. Okay.

Sorry. Sorry. Sorry, man.

Are we just gonna leave everyone back there?

I think I have an idea how we can help them.

Toulon's Mansion?

My guess is that's what switches them on, maybe even controls them. I hope you're right.

It's me they want. Why do they want you, Howie?

Because I'm --

I'll go in. I'll go in.

Howie, no. -l'll go in.

Howie! Howie! You're no hero, so don't even try it.

Now, don't get the sniffles.

Your Cuddly Bear helped k*ll some puppet n*gg*s and can handle hisself just fine.

Just do what I asked you to do until I get home.

Okay. I'll take a bubble bath.

That'll give Cuddly Bear something real nice to think about.

Now go get yourself effervescent.

I will. Bye, Lady Bear.

Bye.

sh*t.

Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!

Aaaaaaaaaaaah!

What? My God.

Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

It's okay.

That was really brave back there.

That was really brave of you, too.

Not bad for a comic-book guy, right?

So, I've been meaning to say something to you for a while.

I just want to explain why I didn't read those comics you gave me. You don't have to explain that.

No, I -- It doesn't matter. It...

Madame Lightning's based on your ex-wife, isn't she?

Yeah.

Well... the thing is...

...l like you... a lot.

And those drawings felt like love letters written to somebody else, and --

Yeah.

It was that obvious?

Yeah. It was to me.

You don't have to be jealous, um...

'cause the truth is...

I'm falling in love you, and I only didn't tell you because I thought it would freak you out.

So...there.

Edgar.

You have to let me drive. Okay.

Let me drive. Let me drive.

Did you just say -- I heard that you love me?

Is that correct?

Yes. Yes.

I just wish I could remember your name.

'Again.

.Ok3Y-

We're here.

Remember that creepy old building?

Yeah. The mausoleum.

Put on your seatbelt.

You have a plan, right?

I do, but I can't tell you the whole plan because I think you will probably panic.

Panic? Why?

Looks like the n*gga's outta juice.

b*tch-a*s puppet.

[Coughing 1 Howie?

Howie?

Aw, sh*t, kid.

sh*t.

It's okay. Just try again.

[ Snarls 1

"Aah!

My God. You okay?

You okay? You okay? My God.

Was that Andre Toulon? I don't know. I think so, yeah.

.Ok3Y-

Noooooooooo!

I wanted to tell you that I think the new Madame Lightning's even better than the first one.

I agree. A-And, man, this issue's really messed up.

L-Lots of terrible sh*t happens to people who don't deserve it.

Yeah. I, - I try to mirror reality in my work, so...

Are you gonna do some more? Um...yeah, probably.

I don't feel like things are fully resolved.

Hi. Hi.

Just one?

Don't ask.

Don't ask.
