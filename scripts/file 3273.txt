It's in my chair...

it looks like me...

and when it stands

I take my seat...

It's in the air

that I breathe...

it's up my sleeve...

Well, in my head...

[sizzling sounds]

Morning, Mom.

Wait. I'm hanging

with Katie later.

Tomorrow, first thing.

Mom, just get it catered

like Deepa Aunty does.

So please, take

it seriously now.

I bet these things were way

more fun when you were a kid.

[phone buzzing]

-Good morning.

-Good morning.

Dad!

Thank you, Poorna.

Sit, sit.

How's the night shift?

I mean, I get to come home

to your mom's food, no?

So... not all bad.

But, tell me...

how is driver's ed?

How long 'til my baby's

a licensed driver?

Ah-ha...

Well, you know what they

say, they say that,

third time is the?

Charm.

[whistling]

Samidha...

Uh, uh, uh...

Please.

-Gotta go.

-Okay.

Love you.

-Love you.

-Love you.

-Samidha...

-Love you.

So, Winthrop's City on the Hill

is kind of a normative fantasy.

Like if you set up a society

based on the moral superiority

of its people,

it's gonna be super rigid

and a little h*m*.

Okay.

Anyone wanna rebut?

Anyone?

Okay, well let's talk about

the economic

repercussions of this statement.

Winthrop's not saying this

in a vacuum

and he's also dealing with

the unrest on the Arbella

as the settlers are making

this long journey.

[Joyce] So, the piety of this

once rich...

Hey.

Hey Russ.

There's a kickback by the old

golf course on Saturday.

It's BYOB.

I can't.

My mom would blow a fuse

if I missed Puja Day.

What's that?

Uh... So this one, like,

god named Durga

k*lled this demon, Mahishasura

and every year we celebrate

her victory.

[Joyce] ... an economic system,

a labour system that hasn't

quite found its...

...bearings.

[Joyce] You're half an hour

late, Tamira, again.

I don't suppose you have

a note for me this time?

Just... just go on, sit down,

please.

[ominous music]

[school bell ringing]

Thank you.

Thank you.

-'Sup Joyce?

-Ah yes, thank you.

See you tomorrow.

Sam... wait.

What is the deal with Tamira?

Why are you asking me?

The other teachers said

you two used to be close.

I mean...

is she doing alright?

Uh... why wouldn't she be?

I hear the way the kids

talk about her

in the halls and...

she eats her lunch

under the bleachers.

Does she ever tell

you anything?

Well we gotta look after

our own, Sam.

Especially when one of them's

falling behind.

Joyce, I really gotta get

to bio.

If she or either of you

are struggling to fit in...

I'm not struggling to fit in.

But if you were...

you could always come to me

for help and...

I know you're good, Sam.

I just wanna make sure

we're looking out for Tamira.

Tamira's a big girl, Joyce.

If she needed help,

she'd probably ask.

Dude... thank you.

My parents would slaughter me

if I got a B in calc.

It's unfair how easy

it is for you.

[shaky breathing]

My stomach seriously drops

every time she, like,

appears out of thin air

like that.

Just so you know,

whatever she's doing,

I'm not against it if it's some

kind of, like, cultural thing.

It's not a cultural thing.

So, um, Russ was asking

about you in health.

[laughs]

Seriously?

He wanted to know if

you spoke another language.

I told him you do.

Hindu.

[laughs]

Hindi.

Say, uh... say Kitty's my

best friend in... in Hindi.

Oh...

Kitty...

[speaking in Hindi]

That is so cool.

Hey, let's... let's, uh,

let's get outta here.

Oh, okay.

My mom's been acting

like such a b*tch.

I think she's menopausal.

Did you know we're supposed

to end up like our moms

when we're older?

I'd hate to end up like my mom.

What? Your mom looks like

she's 25.

It's not how she looks,

it's how she is.

She's so afraid.

You know?

I'll see you later.

[whispers]

Hi Samidha.

Hey.

You know you could just

call me Sam now.

Everyone else does.

I need your help.

What... what do you need?

I need to tell you something

and you just...

you have to believe me.

[voices whispering]

Tamira, you look really tired.

How long's it been

since you've slept?

Promise you'll believe me?

Promise.

Kasam?

Mmhmm.

There's something in here.

I know you can't see it but...

it... it lives inside.

Don't you hear it?

Where...where'd you even

get this thing, Tamira?

I found it at his house.

It was saying my name,

calling out to me.

His house?

Who's house?

I thought I was strong enough

to keep it inside.

I thought... I thought if

I just fed it but it's...

so hungry all the time and...

all it wants is raw meat.

Tamira...

And it's getting stronger

and I'm not strong enough

to keep it inside

so I need your help.

-Okay, Tamira...

-I need your help!

Okay, okay, okay.

I wanna help you, I do.

So just... calm down. Okay?

And tell me the truth.

What's going on with you?

There's a monster in here.

[ominous music]

-[indiscernible whispers]

-[ominous music]

Oh, it's... it's all

the stories,

growing up.

They're... they're true.

You're such a f*cking psycho.

[dramatic music heightens]

No...

Please. Samidha.

I can't do this alone.

Please.

[glass shattering]

[dramatic music heightens]

Tamira...

[panicked breathing]

[muttering]

Hey Tamira, I'm...

You shouldn't have done that.

You dropped...

you dropped this.

Tamira, Tamira, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, okay. I'm-

[shaky breathing]

Tamira?

What... what is it?

[Tamira breathing shakily]

Tamira? Tamira?

Tamira.

Hey. Hey.

-[growling sounds]

-[Tamira screaming]

[muttering in Hindi]

No... I... what?

Samidha! Please!

I'll get help.

I'll get help.

No, no, no.

Don't go!

Don't go!

Hey.

Tamira's mom is filing

a missing person's report.

Have you talked to her?

Does she know

where Tamira's been,

who she's been around?

No.

Sam... you were the last person

to see her.

Did something happen

between you and Tamira?

[Poorna] Samidha?











Have you guys seen

Tamira's mom?

No.

Welcome everybody.

[guest] Shh...

Remember when the Choudharys

used to come to these things?

What was their deal?

Uh...

When we first met them

we knew there was something...

broken...

about that family.

It's like they were running

from something in India.

Then the boy, Karan...

we all thought he was

a good kid.

Smart. Good future.

And then something changed.

You should have seen that boy

the last time I saw him.

He was talking to something...

something that wasn't there.

Hey...

Karan Choudhary...

I can't be here right now.

Guys, shh... come on.

The guests can hear you.

Go, go, go.

Sweetheart. Sweetheart, please.

Please.

'cause I'm feeling alive...



All I need is love...



All I need is love...



Hey!





You alright?

You look a little...

you know.

Uh... just a lot of

new faces.

Hmm.

Do you like, uh,

you like dancing?

I don't dance.

Come on.

I feel lost...

but I'm trying...

I'm trying...



No... no way, I...

I'll watch you dance.

No, thank you.

Come on.

No. I don't even know

anyone here.

Who gives a sh*t?

Alright. Come on.

Russ, I... wait...











[pouring rain]

[thunder crashing]

Oh, my god, I am soaked

and I just got mud

all in your car.

I am so sorry.

No, no I'm fine.

I don't care at all.

Don't worry, it's just mud.

It washes out.

It's fine.

[thunder crashing]

You keep doing that.

What are you thinking about?

[sighs] Tamira.

[Russ] Oh sh*t.

The girl with the jar?

I mean...

Were you guys close or...

She ran away, didn't she?

That's what I heard at least.

I don't...

I don't think she ran away.

Do you remember that, uh...

that Indian kid

who died last year?

Yeah. Uh... he k*lled himself,

right?

Okay, so...

Tamira had his journal.

I think she found it

at his house...

It looks like he was burned

or something?

[both] But it wasn't a fire.

Yeah, I heard that too.

No, sh*t.

Something about him and that

house just feels important.

You know?

[car engine starts]

[music on radio playing]



[thunder crashing]

[ominous music]

[Samidha] I'm sorry.

[Russ] No, you're okay.

Here.

[Samidha] Oh, I'm freezing.

[Russ] Here, I'll take

your coat. Yeah.

[Samidha] Thanks.

Oh my god.

sh*t.

[floorboards creaking]

[Russ] What the hell

happened here?

Neighbors heard screaming

so they called the cops.

Karan's parents were

found mutilated.

They found his body downstairs.

Definitely not going

downstairs then.

[floorboards creaking]

[ominous music]

[camera flashing]

He had drawings like this

in his journal but this is new.

Is that thing...

coming out of the kid

or going inside him?

[police sirens]

sh*t! What do we do?

[Russ] Go, go, go!

Go, go, go!

[Russ] Let's go. let's go!

[dogs barking]

Morning, Mom.

I... I need your help.

I think something really bad

is happening to me.

I... I'm sorry for leaving, Mom.

Of course I do.

Why did you even come here,

Mom?

If that's all you were

ever gonna be?

Just another desi housewife

who cooks and cleans.

[thunder crashing]

[Russ] Got it.

You dropped it in the attic.

Thanks.

You good?

I, uh... I lied about

something.

What?

[indiscernible voices]

Tamira was my best friend.

[Samidha] Back when

we were kids.

[Tamira] I found you!

But then we got to high school

and I wanted more friends.

And I told Tamira it was...

it was time for us to try

and fit in.

But she just didn't

wanna grow up.

And... and I could feel the way

people looked at me

when I was with her

and I just...

I just hated it.

I'm not crazy, right?

No. Not at all.

Like, I hate what I did to her.

But after Karan, it was like...

people started looking

at me different.

They didn't...

they didn't see me.

I don't know.

I just didn't wanna be

that girl.

What girl?

Come on, what girl?

You're nothing like Tamira.

I'm sorry.

Uh... I don't mean to keep

going on about my sh*t.

Was that okay?

Only if you're into it.

Can I, uh...

can I kiss you again?

-Yeah.

-Okay.

[Samidha coughing]

[Russ laughs]

Sorry.

[stairs creaking]

Look, Samidha... Sam...

We're not... we're not angry

with you.

We just want to understand.

Can I go to school, please?

No, Sam...

Poorna...

I don't...

You wouldn't understand.

Please, Sam.

The boy died.

This is serious.

Hey... are you alright?

I heard about Russ.

I'm so sorry.

I didn't hurt him.

No, I know. I just...

Sam, you okay?

I'm gonna tell you something

and I need you to believe me.

Yeah, of course.

Cross my heart and all that.

What's going on?

The cops think an animal

k*lled Russ.

But I was there.

It wasn't an animal,

it was something else.

Whatever it is...

I think it took Tamira.

Why are you whispering?

It's listening.

Um... tell me again, what is...

what is this thing?

I don't know what it is.

Like sometimes it's there

but then it's not there at all.

And... and it shows me things in

my dreams but they feel so real.

Okay. Sam...

you look like you haven't slept

in days

and lack of sleep can

cause hallucinations...

Joyce... this is real.

It's infected my mind.

It's like everything I wanted

outside of me is inside of me

and I can't get it out.

What... what do you mean?

How can I help you?

That's... what's after me.

I... I looked all over and I...

I... I can't... but I can't

find anything.

There's nothing.

Okay. Text that to me

and I'll look into it.

I'm doing you this favor,

now you do me one.

Just take it easy tonight.

Lay low and tomorrow I'd like

to introduce you to someone...

I'm not crazy.

I know, but you're also not

alone and...

I know it might seem like

there's no one

on the whole planet that gets

you or... is trying to get you.

There are people that love you

that care about you...

[Joyce's voice begins to fade]

Sam?

[Joyce] Sam? Sam?

Are you still with me?

[growling]

[screaming]

[panicked breathing]

[ominous music]

[phone buzzing]

Hey. Are you alright?

You ran off and I didn't know

if I was...

[Samidha] Yeah, I'm fine.

Okay. Well... I heard back

about that painting.

What'd you find?

[Joyce] Look, I'm only telling

you this because you asked.

In East Indian mythology

there's a demonic entity

that feeds on negative energy.

It's called the Pishach.

[Joyce] It's a flesh eater.

A devourer of souls.

You have to trap it in a vessel,

a sort of container,

and then keep it there.

[Samidha] A vessel?

[Joyce] Swamis would

sometimes take on the burden

of becoming vessels.

But any container could be

a vessel.

Tamira found it trapped...

trapped inside a jar.

Sam, did you hear these

stories growing up?

From your parents maybe?

[Joyce] Do you think all the

stress from the last few days

has brought these stories back?

-[Samidha] I gotta go.

[Joyce] Hey, hold on. Sam...

Do you need me to come by?

Look... you came to me

for help.

So let me help you.

[Samidha] Yeah.

Okay. Send me your address.

I'll be right there.

[Joyce] Stay safe, Sam.

[crying]

I... I wanna tell you

the truth.

You're not gonna believe me.

Talk to me.

Please, Sam.

When Tamira and I were kids...

you used to tell us those

stories that the ayahs told you.

What is the Pishach, Mom?

Samidha-

Please... tell me.

The ayah said...

never to sleep with a bad

feeling in our hearts.

Because there's a dark thing

that feeds on those feelings.

Anger... hatred... loneliness.

How?

It needs to...

Tenderize the soul by attacking

your sanity.

By isolating you from those

who love you.

[growling sounds]

And if anyone tries

to help you...

It will hurt them.

I know I sound crazy.

But it's real.

All those stories that the ayahs

told you... they're real.

I think it started with Karan.

Dad said that family

was running.

What if they brought it back

to that house?

And that's where

Tamira found it...

trapped inside the jar.

Could she still be alive, Mom?

The Pishach doesn't k*ll you

right away.

It eats you slowly over time.

When it's ready...

it eats your soul.

No. Friday.

Seven. Seven days.

Tamira's gonna die tonight, Mom.

What do we... what do we do?

I have to do something.

Samidha...

Your soul will burn from within

until there's nothing left.

What do we do?

I have to do something, Mom.

What are you doing?

To summon a dark spirit

we must make an offering.

[sighs]

You can do this.

[pounding]

Karan must've died trapping it

in that jar but he did trap it.

He must've written down how.

I've seen this before.

It's a shanti prayer.

A call for peace

from the stars and seas.

Most importantly within you.

This has to be it.

Read it, Mom.

Thanks.

I'm getting better at it.

My mom's been teaching me.

Speaking of...

I gotta get back and help her

with the prasad for the puja.

I worry about you.

You don't have to.

What if it gets out again?

No matter what happens...

it'll never get out again.

We won't let it.

Kasam?

Kasam.

See you tomorrow.
