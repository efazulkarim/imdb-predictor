I hope your answer's no. 
101 
00: 
I said "buy" too many times, right? 102 
00: 
Let's eat. 
103 
00: 
You got no lunchroom here? 
104 
00: 
Here's what we got. 
105 
00: 
We got a gun that was used 
in a homicide. Killed someone. 
106 
00: 
It got stolen out of the property room. Maybe some cop sold it right out. 107 
00: 
Then we got you 
in possession of that gun. 
108 
00: 
We ain't got no lunchroom. 
109 
Page 12/141

Some school fool say he found 
some gun in my locker.

00: 
How did it get in your locker, Shyla? 112 
00: 
Don't use my Christian name 
like we'll be friends. 
113 
00: 
It's my impression you weren't 
in the market for corporate support. 114 
00:

I thought I wouldn't have to. 
But now I need the money.

Juvenile's got her brother

...but she won't talk to us. 
127 
00: 
We can get her detention. 
128 
00: 
Oh, yeah? How? 
Page 14/141
129 
00: 
I'll lose her paperwork. 
130 
00: 
You'd do that? 
Hold her without a charge? 
131 
00: 
For a week. If she wants 
to go home, maybe we get a name. 132 
00: 
Dutch, line three. 
133 
00: 
Van Den Broeck. 
134 
00: 
Clayton? And George Beaufort? 
135 
00: 
Well, Friday's payday, I guess. 136 
00: 
Stick with him till we catch up. 137 
00: 
I want this son of a bitch. 
Alcee, we're on the roll.

00: 
Janice... 
139 
Page 15/141
00: 
I didn't do anything. 
We were just talking. 
140

Don't even think that way. 
Shit like that makes people hate cops. 141 
00: 
Grab a radio. 
142 
00: 
Cassie? 
143 
00: 
You got a car for me? 
144 
00: 
Not the pimpmobile. 
It's surveillance, not narcotics. 145 
00: 
This is it. 
146 
00: 
Your wife called. 
She said things came up at work. 147 
00: 
She can't eat with you 
and you should call. 
148 
00: 
You can see the tail 
Page 16/141
is sticking out of the water. 
149 
00: 
You can hear choppers above me. 150

News choppers are getting 
a better look.

Search and rescue operations-- 
152 
00: 
--about an hour ago, with a reported 103 passengers onboard... 
153 
00: 
That aeroplane, a 12-year-old 737... 154 
00: 
There's Clayton. 
155 
00: 
What the hell's he doing? 
156 
00: 
- What's this clown doing? 
- I don't know. 
157 
00: 
And where's George? 
158 
00: 
- Wait a minute. 
Page 17/141
- Get Elton and Tommy back here quick. 159 
00: 
Tommy, we need you guys back here. Something's going down. 
160 
00: 
Clayton? 
161 
00: 
How you doing? What's going on? 162 
00: 
Where's George, your partner? 
163 
00: 
In the basement. 
164 
00: 
The basement? 
165 
00: 
What's he doing in there? 
166 
00: 
A guy named Marvin is pouring booze without a license. 
167 
00: 
We're getting ready to write him. He comes up with a shotgun. 
168 
00: 
He says he wants money. 
Page 18/141
169 
00: 
He tells me to get it. 
170 
00: 
He's got George. 
171 
00: 
Somebody's holding 
George Beaufort hostage. 
172 
00: 
Can he send us an ear? 
173 
00: 
What's the plan, officer? 
174 
00: 
We could call police. 
175 
00: 
Is that what you're 
getting ready to do? 
176 
00: 
Call the police? 
There's a lot here already. 
177 
00: 
He's got a gun on George. 
We gotta do something. 
178 
00: 
See, we're Internal Affairs. 
Page 19/141
179 
00: 
You got a policeman that screws up. 180 
00: 
You got a policeman 
that abuses his position, steals. 181 
00: 
That's us. 
182 
00: 
What do you think is going on? 
183 
00: 
You think we just happened by? 
184 
00: 
We've been on you all day. All week. 185 
00: 
We've been on you all month. 
186 
00: 
You know what I think? 
187 
00: 
Somebody got sick 
and tired of paying you off. 
188 
00: 
You wanna corroborate that, 
gives us a reason... 
189 
Page 20/141
00: 
...to drag George's ass 
out of the basement. 
190 
00: 
Or we'll talk to the guy 
with the gun, hear his version. 191 
00: 
You're asking me to turn George in? 192 
00: 
Just push me and push me... 
193 
00: 
Marvin? 
194 
00: 
I'm Sergeant Van Den Broeck. 
195 
00: 
Hello, asshole. You're under arrest. 196 
00: 
Who is the real Kay Chandler? 
What's she stand for? 
197 
00: 
Do you know? 
198 
00: 
What's she doing in Congress anyway? 199 
Page 21/141
00: 
Harold Cornelius for Congress. 
200 
00: 
Shirley Magnuson did it. 
201 
00: 
- Pretty good. 
- You think so? 
202 
00: 
She knows you're running 
as Arthur Spencer's daughter. 
203 
00: 
Poor guy's dead, and when he wasn't, he got a lot of votes. 
204 
00: 
So all she does is ask 
a couple of questions. 
205 
00: 
The subtext is "She only 
got elected because of her daddy." 206 
00: 
She didn't earn it. 
This is America. That ain't fair. 207 
00: 
I'm not running 
as Arthur Spencer's daughter. 
208 
00: 
Page 22/141
What will you run as? Nice person? 209 
00: 
I have my own record. 
210 
00: 
City attorney? 
"National committeewoman"? 
211 
00: 
A record's when somebody 
remembers what you did. 
212 
00: 
I beat Harvey Galin five to three. 213 
00: 
My, my. 
214 
00: 
Five to three. 
215 
00: 
How'd those three vote Democratic in a district that hadn't... 
216 
00: 
...voted for a Democrat since 
Roosevelt? They're sending a message. 217 
00: 
This won't be a nice election. 
218 
00: 
Page 23/141
Folks talking about 
the amber waves of grain. 
219 
00: 
It's about the man's money 
against the woman's name. 
220 
00: 
Can't beat you on your record. 
You have none. 
221 
00: 
He won't beat you on the issues. 222 
00: 
On the issues, I'll kick his ass. 223 
00: 
The question is, 
can you beat Shirley Magnuson? 
224 
00: 
I'm not running against 
Shirley Magnuson. 
225 
00: 
What you don't want in the papers... 226 
00: 
...what you haven't told your husband, she'll find it. 
227 
00: 
Shirley's wasting her time. 
228 
Page 24/141
00: 
How's your marriage? 
229 
00: 
Swell. How's yours? 
230 
00: 
If I was running for office, 
I'd be in trouble. 
231 
00: 
You fool around, Mrs. Chandler? A little slap and tickle? 
232 
00: 
Any special friends? 
233 
00: 
Not at the moment, 
but I'll keep you posted. 
234 
00: 
What's the worst thing 
you've done? 
235 
00: 
You need a life, Mr. Broman. 
236 
00: 
For a moment, I thought we wouldn't have any fun at all. 
237 
00: 
I didn't take a dime from you, 
Page 25/141
you bastard. 
238 
00: 
Marvin... 
239 
00: 
We don't come up soon, 
they'll come and get us. 
240 
00: 
What you think they'd do about me? 241 
00: 
You'll pay a fine for pouring liquor without a license... 
242 
00: 
...but I need you to testify 
against George. 
243 
00: 
You got some leverage. 
244 
00: 
Wanna make your situation worse? 245 
00: 
Just keep thinking 
what you're thinking. 
246 
00: 
You pay a little fine, 
plead to disorderly. 
247 
Page 26/141
00: 
But you gotta promise 
you'll show up against George. 
248 
00: 
I gotta have that shotgun. 
249 
00: 
Now. 
250 
00: 
Good man. Go on up. 
251 
00: 
Alcee, Marvin's coming up. 
252 
00: 
Get him downtown. 
Take real good care of him, okay? 253 
00: 
Were you really gonna shoot him? 254 
00: 
He had that shotgun 
pointed right at me. 
255 
00: 
What would you do about me? 
256 
00: 
I figured he'd shoot you. 
257 
00: 
Page 27/141
And I'd shoot him, get myself a medal. 258 
00: 
You'd be dead, of course. 
259 
00: 
You got a right 
to remain silent, officer. 
260 
00: 
Use it. 
261 
00: 
--95 passengers and crew members are now feared lost. 
262 
00: 
Navy divers were expected 
to work throughout the night. 
263 
00: 
Will Thomas, are you there? 
264 
00: 
They already have a crane trying to hoist the plane out of the water. 265 
00: 
We've got divers. 
266 
00: 
Where's Peyton? 
267 
00: 
Page 28/141
Working late. 
268 
00: 
You gonna eat? 
We've got bay scallops. 
269 
00: 
See if I can find her. 
270 
00: 
--the plane struck the surface 
at an angle... 
271 
00: 
...and bounced at least one time before plowing into the water nose first. 272 
00: 
I'm at Billy's. I'll call you at home. 273 
00: 
If we don't catch up, I'll eat here. He's got scallops. 
274 
00: 
Love you. Bye. 
275 
00: 
It's the Van Den Broecks. 
Leave a message. We'll call you back. 276 
00: 
To play back your messages, press one. 277 
Page 29/141
00: 
Hi, I'm at the airport. 
278 
00: 
I send a catalogue to Miami without me, and it's falling apart.: 
279 
00: 
A new stylist, locations don't work, bugs biting the girls... 
280 
00: 
...and you don't wanna know what else. 281 
00: 
Therefore, I'm on the plane 
to kill critters and counsel careers. 282 
00: 
I'll try to get back tomorrow, 
but it may not be till Sunday. 
283 
00: 
God knows where I'll sleep. 
They're in the Keys. 
284 
00: 
I'll call you when I can. 
285 
00: 
I had fun this morning. 
286 
00: 
I love you. 
287 
Page 30/141
00: 
You find her? 
288 
00: 
No. That plane was going to Miami, wasn't it? 
289 
00: 
Give me some quarters. 
290 
00: 
I once got laid in Miami. 
291 
00: 
My name's Van Den Broeck. 
292 
00: 
I'm a police officer, 
if that makes any difference. 
293 
00: 
I know you get a lot of crazies when something like this happens. 294 
00: 
I think it's possible my wife 
may have been on your plane. 
295 
00: 
Peyton Van Den Broeck. 
296 
00: 
Great. Boy. She must be on another flight. Boy, that'll wake you up. 
Page 31/141
297 
00: 
What are the other flights to Miami? 298 
00: 
Check the 1 : 
but it doesn't make sense. 
299 
00: 
She left for the airport after 9. 300 
00: 
Excuse me. I'm Bill Van Den Broeck, Peyton's husband. 
301 
00: 
She went to Miami today. 
I need to know what plane she was on. 302 
00: 
I can be with you in just one moment. 303 
00: 
We don't have this in a six, 
but I can order it. 
304 
00: 
I'm Bill Van Den Broeck, 
Peyton's husband. 
305 
00: 
She went to Miami. 
I need to know what plane she was on. 306 
Page 32/141
00: 
- You're the policeman? 
- Right. 
307 
00: 
Mary Claire Clark books the travel, but she goes home at 5:30. 
308 
00: 
Can you reach her at home? 
309 
00: 
Oh, my God! The plane that crashed. 310 
00: 
She was going to Miami, 
but they don't have her listed. 311 
00: 
How do we get ahold 
of Mary Claire Clark? 
312 
00: 
Do we have to shout? 
313 
00: 
Peyton went to Miami. 
She might be on the plane that crashed. 314 
00: 
We have to find out 
what flight she was on. 
315 
00: 
Page 33/141
Does anyone know what 
Mary Claire Clark was doing tonight? 316 
00: 
Call the switchboard. 
Get her number. 
317 
00: 
The airline won't tell you? 
318 
00: 
She's not listed, 
but she's not listed on any flight. 319 
00: 
I know she was going. 
She left messages at work and home. 320 
00: 
They can't give out home numbers. 321 
00: 
This is Molly Roll. Who's this? 322 
00: 
I need your help. I'm the supervisor in Designer Wear... 
323 
00: 
...and you'll confirm that when you call me back at extension 293, okay? 324 
00: 
I need the home telephone number of Mary Claire Clark. 
Page 34/141
325 
00: 
She's the department secretary. 326 
00: 
We are managing an emergency. 
Do you understand? 
327 
00: 
Thank you. 
328 
00: 
You must be Dutch. I'm Molly. 
329 
00: 
What was she doing in Miami? 
330 
00: 
It sounded like some kind of crisis. 331 
00: 
You're shooting a catalogue in the Keys that was falling apart? 
332 
00: 
What would we be shooting in the Keys? 333 
00: 
Did she say which catalogue? 
334 
00: 
Molly Roll. 
335 
Page 35/141

00: 
Thank you. 
336 
00: 
Sarah, would you get her for me? 337 
00: 
I'll get my boss. 
338 
00: 
What catalogue are we shooting? 339 
00: 
I didn't know we were doing a catalogue. 340 
00: 
Susan, are you working? 
341 
00: 
- Peyton didn't know she was going. - There's no answer. 
342 
00: 
Somebody must've called her. 
343 
00: 
Would she call Mary Claire 
for a reservation or would she... 344 
00: 
...use a travel agent? 
345 
00: 
This is Mr. Driker, vice president Page 36/141

of Designer Wear. He's our boss. 346 
00: 
- Would you excuse us, please? 
- Sure. 
347 
00: 
Molly says Peyton may be 
on the plane that crashed. 
348 
00: 
- Is Peyton on that plane? 
- We don't know. 
349 
00: 
- Either way, she's toast. 
- Can you zip it? 
350 
00: 
We don't have a catalogue shooting in Florida or anywhere else. 
351 
00: 
The next catalogue's not till Christmas. 352 
00: 
Maybe it's not a catalogue. 
353 
00: 
Something with models. 
The girls were bit by bugs. 
354 
00: 
No, there's nothing like that. 
355 
Page 37/141
00: 
If Peyton's travelling, 
I don't think it's for the store. 356 
00: 
I know when people are out of town. I approve it, and we're stingy on travel. 357 
00: 
Are you saying she lied to me? 
358 
00: 
I'm saying I don't know where she is. 359 
00: 
I'm thinking of something I can do. I'd like to be helpful. 
360 
00: 
There was this judge who had... 361 
00: 
...two whole entire families, kids, dogs, everything. A judge. 
362 
00: 
We think we know. We don't know. 363 
00: 
Nobody knows. You just don't know. 364 
00: 
Oh, my God. 
365 
Page 38/141
00: 
Maybe she travelled as someone's wife. If anyone knows what his name is... 366 
00: 
...I could check that way. 
367 
00: 
I don't know. Honestly. 
368 
00: 
Beats me. She seemed... 
369 
00: 
I mean, she never looked 
like she was looking. 
370 
00: 
Like girls look 
if they're looking, okay? 
371 
00: 
Mr. Van Den Broeck... 
372 
00: 
...I think I know Peyton 
as well as anyone here. 
373 
00: 
I've got no idea. 
374 
00: 
Are you surprised? 
375 
Page 39/141
00: 
The important thing is we don't know if she was on the plane. 
376 
00: 
I think she was on the plane. 
377 
00: 
Jessie, tell me the truth. 
Are kids drinking at these parties? 378 
00: 
I invented some of the excuses 
you're giving me. 
379 
00: 
I've been 15. You've never been 35. 380 
00: 
Okay, okay, 37. 
381 
00: 
I'll see for myself Wednesday. 
382 
00: 
5'6." 
383 
00: 
120. 
384 
00: 
Blue eyes. 
385 
Page 40/141
00: 
A wedding band, just plain. 
386 
00: 
A diamond ring, emerald-cut, 
about a carat. 
387 
00: 
I'm telling you, she was on your plane. If I'm wrong, great! 
388 
00: 
If I'm right, you know 
who to call, okay? 
389 
00: 
Got some empty boxes? 
390 
00: 
Ask the guy out back. 
391 
00: 
Excuse me. 
392 
00: 
Are you Mr. Van Den Broeck? 
393 
00: 
I'm David Dotson. This is 
Phyllis Bonaparte. Southern Airlines. 394 
00: 
- Do you have a minute to talk to us? - Sure. 
395 
Page 41/141
00: 
Mr. Van Den Broeck... 
396 
00: 
...we don't show your wife as anybody's passenger on any flight to Miami. 397 
00: 
Hi, I'm at the airport. 
398 
00: 
I send a catalogue to Miami without me, and it's falling apart.: 
399 
00: 
A new stylist, locations don't work, bugs biting the girls... 
400 
00: 
...and you don't wanna know what else. 401 
00: 
Therefore, I'm on the plane to kill-- 402 
00: 
No one named Van Den Broeck reserved or bought a ticket to Miami. 
403 
00: 
There is no catalogue shoot. 
She works for Saks. 
404 
00: 
They don't know where she is. 
Page 42/141

405 
00: 
I think she was gonna spend the weekend in Miami with another guy. 
406 
00: 
If she was, would she tell 
the truth about her destination? 407 
00: 
Trick is not to lie more than you have to. Got a passenger list? 
408 
00: 
I can't let you see it. 
409 
00: 
I figure he bought the tickets 
"Mr. and Mrs." 
410 
00: 
I think he's married. Be interesting when you call his house. 
411 
00: 
- I'm not allowed-- 
- Let him see the list. 
412 
00: 
- I need that back. 
- They'll give you another one. 413 
00: 
A Royal Regency Hotel is 
near where the plane went down. Page 43/141

414 
00: 
We have rooms there 
for family members. 
415 
00: 
Why don't you drive down with us? You'll have to identify-- 
416 
00: 
To make the identification. 
417 
00: 
Sit around with the next of kin? I got a lot of things to do. 
418 
00: 
I don't think you should be 
alone right now. 
419 
00: 
I was alone before you got here. 420 
00: 
Everybody, listen up. Listen up. 421 
00: 
A guy thinks his wife was on 437... 422 
00: 
...travelling with a man 
on Mr.-and-Mrs. tickets. 
423 
00: 
Page 44/141
He's a cop, so as far as we know, he's not nuts. 
424 
00: 
Who the wife's boyfriend is, 
he hasn't got a clue. 
425 
00: 
We got nine M-and-Ms. Another two pair sitting together, same last name. 426 
00: 
Married, cousins, who knows? 
Be careful. 
427 
00: 
Don't assume a deceased Mrs. 
is for real. 
428 
00: 
We don't wanna be the ones telling some widow her husband died happy. 429 
00: 
And we don't wanna tell kids that Mom's gone when Mom's asleep in Bethesda. 430 
00: 
What does your sex life have to do with saving social security? 
431 
00: 
Tell me that. 
432 
00: 
Page 45/141
According to 
Shirley Magnuson, everything. 
433 
00: 
What is the worst thing 
you've ever done? 
434 
00: 
If I've already done it, 
it'll be a dull life. 
435 
00: 
You're gonna be a big disappointment to old Shirley. 
436 
00: 
You think Cullen's the last man you'll ever sleep with? 
437 
00: 
College was best. 
All that stuff going on. 
438 
00: 
"When's he gonna call? 
When's he gonna kiss me?" 
439 
00: 
At night, when I bring it back... 440 
00: 
...I get that ache all over again. 441 
00: 
I'll tell Richard to host 
Page 46/141
the fundraiser. Come over. 
442 
00: 
Both of you. 
We'll make a guest list. 
443 
00: 
He's in New York. 
444 
00: 
What are you doing here on Saturday? 445 
00: 
George and Clayton made bond. 
446 
00: 
You know this ain't the best case we ever made. 
447 
00: 
We got Clayton's statement. 
Did you read him his rights? 
448 
00: 
He'll say I didn't. 
449 
00: 
We got Marvin. 
450 
00: 
Something wrong with you? 
451 
00: 
What's wrong, Dutch? 
Page 47/141
452 
00: 
Dick? Sorry. 
453 
00: 
Three A and B, 
Mr. and Mrs. Cullen Chandler. 
454 
00: 
No one's called. 
455 
00: 
There's an unlisted number for 
a Cullen Chandler at the Metropolitan. 456 
00: 
Doorman says Mrs. Chandler 
is a congresswoman. 
457 
00: 
And he saw her today. 
She was going jogging. 
458 
00: 
When I was small, 
I knew my father was in politics. 459 
00: 
I didn't know what that was, 
or why he went to Washington. 
460 
00: 
Let's make it "dad." "My dad." 
461 
Page 48/141
00: 
Instead of "father." 
Warms it up a little. 
462 
00: 
"Dad." All right. 
463 
00: 
Kay Chandler, take three. 
464 
00: 
Hello. I'm Kay Chandler 
and I'm running for Congress. 
465 
00: 
When I was small, 
I knew my dad was in politics-- 466 
00: 
Maybe it should be "kid." 
467 
00: 
"When I was a kid"... 
468 
00: 
"When I was just a kid." 
How about that? 
469 
00: 
"When I was a kid." 
470 
00: 
Help you? 
471 
Page 49/141
00: 
We need to speak to Mrs. Chandler. 472 
00: 
- We're taping. 
- It's all right. What is it? 
473 
00: 
Mrs. Chandler, I'm Dick Montoya. This is Phyllis Bonaparte. 
474 
00: 
We're with Southern Airlines. 
475 
00: 
Is there somewhere we can talk? 476 
00: 
Well, about what? 
477 
00: 
I'm very sorry to have to tell you. 478 
00: 
Your husband was on our flight... 479 
00: 
...to Miami yesterday. 
480 
00: 
What? 
481 
00: 
The one that-- 
Page 50/141
482 
00: 
No, no, no. Cullen's in New York. 483 
00: 
I wish that were so, ma'am. 
484 
00: 
You do fly to New York, don't you? 485 
00: 
Not from Washington, no, ma'am. No. 486 
00: 
The identification is correct. 
487 
00: 
I'm awfully sorry. 
488 
00: 
He said he was going to New York. Why would he go to Miami? 
489 
00: 
The identification is correct. 
We have his wallet. 
490 
00: 
I'm very sorry. 
491 
00: 
If something happened to him 
it'll lead the news tonight. 
492 
Page 51/141
00: 
Where's your daughter? 
493 
00: 
We have a daughter. She's 15. 
494 
00: 
We won't release the casualty list till all families are notified. 495 
00: 
But we need your help 
identifying your husband. 
496 
00: 
Where is he? 
497 
00: 
Patuxent Naval Air Station. 
498 
00: 
- I have to get home. 
- I understand. Let us help. 
499 
00: 
Call Dick Taradisian at the White House. Tell him what the deal is. 
500 
00: 
Ask him if he can get a plane 
to meet us at Patuxent. 
501 
00: 
If the Air Force can't do it, 
Page 52/141

call GM or anybody with a jet. 
502 
00: 
He did say Miami. 
503 
00: 
Usually it's New York, 
but this time he said Miami. 
504 
00: 
Mr. Van Den Broeck, 
we have a car for you. 
505 
00: 
Ma, what are you doing home? 
506 
00: 
Where's Dad? 
507 
00: 
"Thou anointest my head with oil. 508 
00: 
My cup runneth over. 
509 
00: 
Surely goodness and mercy 
shall follow me... 
510 
00: 
...all the days of my life... 
511 
00: 
...and I will dwell in the house Page 53/141

of the Lord forever." 
512 
00: 
Let us pray. 
513 
00: 
Almighty God, Father of mercies and giver of all comfort... 
514 
00: 
I met this guy because he was 
smart enough to get out of the rain. 515 
00: 
I was too. 
516 
00: 
So we waited under the arch 
in the Law quad till it was over. 517 
00: 
And then he asked me... 
518 
00: 
...if I knew where the bookstore was. 519 
00: 
And I said... 
520 
00: 
...I happened to be going there myself, which was a lie, of course. 
521 
00: 
Page 54/141
We had so many great days. 
522 
00: 
Just not enough years. 
523 
00: 
But we had his love. 
524 
00: 
Maybe I'll call you. 
525 
00: 
Let's go. 
526 
00: 
Excuse me. 
527 
00: 
Excuse me. 
528 
00: 
Are you Mary Claire Clark? 
529 
00: 
Yes. I am so sorry. 
530 
00: 
The name Cullen Chandler 
mean anything? 
531 
00: 
No. 
532 
Page 55/141
00: 
If I'd called my wife that morning, what would you have said? 
533 
00: 
That she called in and said 
she was taking the day off. 
534 
00: 
But you wouldn't have gotten me. She sent me to Tyson's Corners... 535 
00: 
...and said I could go home. 
536 
00: 
So I'd have gotten her voice mail? 537 
00: 
Thank you. 
538 
00: 
Mr. Van Den Broeck... 
539 
00: 
...I have some of her... 
540 
00: 
...personal things. 
I could drop them off-- 
541 
00: 
I'll take them now. 
542 
Page 56/141
00: 
I know. 
543 
00: 
I gotta get out of here. 
I'll take Jess. 
544 
00: 
Kay, it's gonna look like-- 
545 
00: 
I don't care. 
Just get us back to Washington. 546 
00: 
I can't see these people. 
547 
00: 
It's like going-- 
548 
00: 
Don't make a mistake now. 
Everybody's watching. 
549 
00: 
Just one more day. 
550 
00: 
How can I find out if a guy 
was on a flight to Miami in May? 551 
00: 
My name is Bill Van Den Broeck. 552 
Page 57/141
00: 
- They said you're a policeman. - I am. 
553 
00: 
But I'm not working right now. 
554 
00: 
Then what is this about? 
555 
00: 
My wife was on that plane 
that your husband was on. 
556 
00: 
I'm sorry. 
557 
00: 
- I wonder if I could have a few minutes. - I just got home. 
558 
00: 
This isn't a good time for me. 
559 
00: 
For me either. 
560 
00: 
So you're visiting survivors. 
561 
00: 
You're the only one. 
562 
00: 
Page 58/141
I'd ask you to sit-- 
563 
00: 
I don't understand. 
564 
00: 
My daughter's due back any minute. 565 
00: 
Do you have kids? 
566 
00: 
Jessica. She's 15. 
567 
00: 
Is there something 
you wanna know, Mr...? 
568 
00: 
I'm sorry, I forgot your name. 
569 
00: 
It's Van Den Broeck. 
570 
00: 
I just thought that... 
571 
00: 
I'm so sorry. 
572 
00: 
It's really... 
573 
Page 59/141
00: 
It's unspeakable. 
574 
00: 
Unspeakable. 
575 
00: 
But you seem okay. 
576 
00: 
Do I? 
577 
00: 
Paper said your husband was a lawyer in New Hampshire. 
578 
00: 
He has an office here. 
579 
00: 
Most of his work was here. 
580 
00: 
I'm in Congress. 
581 
00: 
Yeah, I know. 
582 
00: 
So why was he going to Miami? 
583 
00: 
Business. 
584 
Page 60/141
00: 
He had business there. 
585 
00: 
Are you investigating something? 586 
00: 
They were sitting together on the plane. 587 
00: 
Your husband. 
588 
00: 
My wife. 
589 
00: 
Do you know that? 
590 
00: 
Three A and B. 
591 
00: 
First class. 
592 
00: 
First class isn't what it used to be. It's not worth the money. 
593 
00: 
Is there anything else? 
594 
00: 
You mad at me? 
Page 61/141
595 
00: 
I don't know you, lieutenant. 
Why would I be mad? 
596 
00: 
I'm a sergeant. 
597 
00: 
What are you? A sophisticator? 
598 
00: 
That's my daughter. 
599 
00: 
Sorry. An airline guy left 
Dad's things downstairs... 
600 
00: 
...so I brought them up. 
601 
00: 
This is my daughter, Jessica. 
602 
00: 
This is Sergeant-- 
603 
00: 
Van Den Broeck. They call me Dutch. It's easier. 
604 
00: 
He lost his wife on the plane. 
605 
Page 62/141
00: 
I'm sorry. 
606 
00: 
Never been to New Hampshire. 
You go to school there or here? 607 
00: 
I go to Andover. It's a prep school. 608 
00: 
I won't take any more of your time. 609 
00: 
- I'm sorry about your dad. 
- Thanks. 
610 
00: 
Nice to meet you. 
611 
00: 
I need an hour. 
It's not a lot to ask. 
612 
00: 
Don't come around here again. 
613 
00: 
They must've cleaned them. 
614 
00: 
It must-- 
615 
Page 63/141
00: 
I'm sure it's for your birthday. 616 
00: 
Dad said he was gonna 
get you something great. 
617 
00: 
Expensive. 
618 
00: 
He knew I'd say no. 
619 
00: 
I know you're worried about me... 620 
00: 
...but I still want you to run. 621 
00: 
I'll be fine. 
622 
00: 
I don't want us to sit around here all day and be depressed. 
623 
00: 
I'm gonna go back to school tomorrow. 624 
00: 
All my friends are there. 
And it's only 40 miles. 
625 
00: 
Page 64/141
I can come home on weekends if I want. 626 
00: 
Somebody popped Marvin. 
627 
00: 
Jesus Christ! 
628 
00: 
Shit! 
629 
00: 
George Beaufort did this. 
630 
00: 
What else did you 
find in here? Anything? 
631 
00: 
Is this a bad time? 
632 
00: 
I don't need to go 
through all that garbage. 
633 
00: 
My case'll get kicked because 
somebody killed my only witness. 634 
00: 
- You get in there and do it! 
- Easy, easy. 
635 
00: 
Page 65/141
The last pickup was a week ago. 636 
00: 
It hasn't been that long. 
637 
00: 
It sure smells long. 
638 
00: 
Sheila, what are you doing here? 639 
00: 
That ain't even my name. 
640 
00: 
Let's talk to people. 
Take that side. I'll take this side. 641 
00: 
It's Homicide's. 
642 
00: 
- We're off it. 
- The hell we are. 
643 
00: 
- I will not allow you to-- 
- I have no choice. I need your help. 644 
00: 
Before you told me my husband 
was screwing your wife... 
645 
00: 
Page 66/141
...did it occur to you that 
that might be hurtful? 
646 
00: 
You knew already. 
647 
00: 
Suppose I didn't. 
648 
00: 
How did you know? 
649 
00: 
He told me he was going to New York. 650 
00: 
He's on the wrong plane, 
so it must be another woman? 
651 
00: 
Well, it could've been amnesia. 652 
00: 
My wife was in Miami 
in February and in May. 
653 
00: 
- Do you think your husband was? - What difference does it make? 654 
00: 
It's over. It's entirely over. 
655 
00: 
Page 67/141
They're through with each other! We are through with them! 
656 
00: 
We can't even get a divorce! 
657 
00: 
You can do that. 
658 
00: 
I have a child. 
659 
00: 
I try and go back... 
660 
00: 
...in my head. 
661 
00: 
What's the last thing 
you remember... 
662 
00: 
...about you and your husband 
that you know is true? 
663 
00: 
I gotta find out how far back 
I have to go to do that. 
664 
00: 
This is where they were gonna stay. 665 
00: 
Page 68/141
I've got work to do. 
666 
00: 
Don't you wanna know how it started? 667 
00: 
How long it was going on? 
668 
00: 
You don't wanna know their plans? You don't wanna know anything? 
669 
00: 
What she thought 
when she thought about me. 
670 
00: 
I'd like to know that. 
671 
00: 
I thought you might like to know what she looked like. 
672 
00: 
You leave me alone. 
673 
00: 
I mean it. 
674 
00: 
Thirty. 
675 
00: 
Take a number and have a seat. 
Page 69/141
676 
00: 
Alice Beaufort? George Beaufort's wife? 677 
00: 
Is he all right? 
678 
00: 
He's fine. 
679 
00: 
I'm Sergeant Van Den Broeck. 
I'd like to ask a few questions. 680 
00: 
He was with me. 
681 
00: 
What time was that? 
682 
00: 
Any time you're talking about. 
683 
00: 
Thirty-one. 
684 
00: 
You've got an envelope. 
685 
00: 
February was swimsuits 
and May was fall fashion. 
686 
Page 70/141
00: 
And you saw those catalogues? 
687 
00: 
I saw the catalogues. I told you twice. I'll get them for you. 
688 
00: 
How do we know she shot them in Miami? What if--? 
689 
00: 
There were palm trees. 
690 
00: 
There was a beach 
and a very big ocean. 
691 
00: 
If she doesn't run, she's crazy. 692 
00: 
It's a sympathy bounce, but she's up 14 points since the funeral. 693 
00: 
I think she'll stay in, 
but she'll need some time. 
694 
00: 
She's this brave widow with this kid. They're eating it up. 
695 
00: 
You're hard. 
Page 71/141
696 
00: 
She knows. I know she knows. 
697 
00: 
Maybe he was buying a boat. 
698 
00: 
Maybe it was drugs 
or government work. 
699 
00: 
Why are you so determined 
it's another woman? 
700 
00: 
Why are you protecting him? 
If you know who it is, I swear-- 701 
00: 
You think I lied the first five times, but now I'll cave? 
702 
00: 
Why is this so important to you? 703 
00: 
I caught Sam with a woman once. 704 
00: 
I spilled a milkshake on my skirt, so I ran home from lunch. 
705 
00: 
Page 72/141
I heard them in the shower. 
706 
00: 
And at first, I thought 
it was the radio. 
707 
00: 
But what she was saying 
you don't hear on the radio. 
708 
00: 
I ran. 
709 
00: 
I couldn't go back to work. 
710 
00: 
For hours, literally... 
711 
00: 
...I didn't remember... 
712 
00: 
...that I was involved 
with someone else. 
713 
00: 
I had been for months. 
714 
00: 
And I liked my life with Sam. 
Things were fine. 
715 
00: 
Page 73/141
What'd you do? 
716 
00: 
I kept my mouth shut. 
717 
00: 
And I never went home again 
without calling first. 
718 
00: 
To say that involvement... 
719 
00: 
...and I don't mean casual sex, I mean romance. 
720 
00: 
To say that that whole part 
of life... 
721 
00: 
...half the fun of life has to end... 722 
00: 
If you told me that had to be over... 723 
00: 
...I'd feel old. 
724 
00: 
If you had known about Peyton... 725 
00: 
...would you tell me? 
Page 74/141

726 
00: 
Now, I mean. 
727 
00: 
No. 
728 
00: 
I'm gonna run to the ladies' room. 729 
00: 
Get me another one. 
730 
00: 
Broman's over there dreaming up ways to remind you of my loss. 
731 
00: 
A detective came by 
the office today... 
732 
00: 
...asking about Cullen. 
733 
00: 
I wasn't there. Barry said he asked how much Cullen travelled. 
734 
00: 
He seemed particularly 
interested in Miami. 
735 
00: 
Asked who our Miami clients were. Page 75/141

736 
00: 
Said he was going there tomorrow. 737 
00: 
Is this anything I should know about? 738 
00: 
I have no idea. 
739 
00: 
I'm sorry. It's too soon. 
740 
00: 
- I'm sorry. 
- I wanna go home. 
741 
00: 
- Wait for Wendy. 
- I'll get a cab. Tell Wendy I'm sorry. 742 
00: 
Leave a message. I'll call you back. 743 
00: 
Mr. Van Den Broeck? Hi. 
744 
00: 
I'm so sorry about Peyton. 
745 
00: 
Come. Have a coffee. 
746 
Page 76/141
00: 
February, we shoot in the studios... 747 
00: 
...May, the Keys, 
to get away from tourists. 
748 
00: 
Why come to Miami twice in a row? Why not go somewhere else? 
749 
00: 
I would like to think 
it was my work... 
750 
00: 
...but I suspect so she can 
walk the city and sketch. 
751 
00: 
She loved the streets, the markets... 752 
00: 
...the Latin music. 
753 
00: 
Was there a man? 
754 
00: 
I don't think there is a man, no. 755 
00: 
What did she do after work? 
756 
Page 77/141
00: 
More walking. 
757 
00: 
But sometimes the clubs, 
for music and to watch the dancing. 758 
00: 
You know who she went with? 
759 
00: 
If I can say... 
760 
00: 
If you wanna be with a woman, 
these shoots are not so good for that. 761 
00: 
Did you ever sleep with Peyton? 762 
00: 
Your situation is very difficult. 763 
00: 
I excuse the question. 
764 
00: 
Could I talk to somebody 
in your security department? 
765 
00: 
It looks like she did. 
766 
01: 
Page 78/141
Can we talk someplace? 
767 
01: 
Stoli, please, on the rocks. 
768 
01: 
I'm from a little town 
in a little state. 
769 
01: 
Unfortunately, I'm in Congress. 770 
01: 
So when you interview people, 
it's easy to start talk. 
771 
01: 
They might stumble on the truth. You can't possibly want that. 
772 
01: 
- You're the only one I wanna talk to. - I don't know anything! 
773 
01: 
What do you wanna know? 
774 
01: 
- How long it went on. 
- So we know how stupid to feel? 775 
01: 
How they met, their plans. 
776 
Page 79/141
01: 
I can't help you. 
777 
01: 
At least you tried. 
778 
01: 
You trying to be funny? 
779 
01: 
No. Not anymore. 
780 
01: 
Don't you fuck with me! 
781 
01: 
If you don't like that word, 
don't use it. 
782 
01: 
Do you know what happens when a member of Congress accuses you of harassment? 783 
01: 
We'd get our names in the newspapers. 784 
01: 
That's close to blackmail. 
785 
01: 
I'm not a lawyer. 
786 
01: 
I'm not some investigation.
