Everyone always said I'd end up this way,

that my last name is cursed,

and I'd be dead or a k*ller

before graduation.

And in a way, I guess they were right.

This is where it all went down, Shadyside,

where the future crawls to die.

Unlike our perfect neighbors in Sunnyvale,

we're kind of a sh*t show.

People say this town is cursed,

that something happens to people

to make them... snap.

Not everyone wants to be known for that.

Especially not Vice Principal Brekenridge.

- Ramone! That goes over there.

- Yeah, right there.

She used to run a convent

for reforming bad girls.

You know where that goes.

Now she's reforming Shadyside.

That guy beside her?

Principal Wayland.

He's technically in charge,

but we all know who pulls the strings.

It's all been leading up to prom.

Shadysiders, this is Harmony LaFay,

your favorite school reporter,

bringing you all the breaking news

as we count down to the big night.

That's right.

Only two days to go until senior prom!

Eat a d*ck, LaFay!

And prom queen.

The perfect girl to represent

the perfect new Shadyside.

Six of us are running.

And here's our red-hot favorite.

Tiffany Falconer, leader of the Wolfpack.

Your typical mean girl

has tormented me since birth.

And her competition?

How's it feel

to be prom queen favorite, Christy?

Better than sex.

Later.

Christy Renault,

small-time weed dealer, big-time rebel.

I'm pretty sure she's only running

to piss off Brekenridge.

And Tiffany's Wolfpack.

Linda.

She has perfect grades.

And thanks to her, so does Tiffany.

Debbie. Tiffany's mouthpiece.

She can ruin a reputation

in a single lunch period.

Melissa. The lapdog.

Tiffany says, "Jump."

Melissa says, "How high?"

And then there's me,

Lori Granger, the final candidate.

Unlike Tiffany,

I'm definitely not popular.

I've learned to keep my head down,

but it's time for something to change.

Not everyone is obsessed with prom.

Megan Rogers.

Stoner. Horror nerd.

My best friend.

Megan thinks prom is super lame,

but she's got my back.

It would be a cold night in hell

if I actually won prom queen,

but it's senior year.

This is my last chance to show everyone

I'm more than just a Shadyside sob story.

But sh*t, I didn't know the half of it.

Everyone knows

what aspiration means, right?

Breathing through your a*s?

Now listen.

You're all representatives of Shadyside.

Your future job matters.

And if you want to be successful,

you need to show that you're special.

And a great resume is one way to do that.

You also need ambition.

Devlin. What do you want to be?

- What do you mean?

- After you graduate.

What's your plan, buddy?

Are you even listening?

Is jerking it for Jesus a job?

Okay, enough. Focus, people.

Lori Granger. What about you?

Oh, she's going to be a writer.

Writer my a*s.

- There's no writers from Shady.

- What's she going to write?

"My mother stabbed my dad in the face,"

by Lori Granger.

She didn't do it.

Who did it then?

Granger's in denial. It's tragic.

m*therf*cking Wolfpack.

Okay, settle down, everyone.

Listen, it's okay to dream,

but it's also important to be realistic.

Okay, everyone.

Let's get back to those resumes.

May your dad rest in hell, Granger.

Megan.

Oh my God!

Holy sh*t!

This is on you, you evil fucks!

Gotcha.

- That's not funny.

- What the f*ck?

- Are you crazy?

- Can't you see she's psychotic?

Megan Rogers.

Principal's office right f*cking now!

Epic.

Piece of sh*t, Rogers!

- Mental case.

- Stop.

You're done!

Simulated self-mutilation.

I bet no one's ever been

written up for that before.

It was epic.

It might just be your masterpiece.

And even Christy dug it.

It was f*cking sick.

Did you see their faces?

Serves them right.

Can't believe they dredged up

your family stuff again.

Your mom's innocent.

- When are they going to lay off?

- It'll never stop.

f*ck them.

Could you imagine if you actually won?

Their puny brains would explode.

Thanks.

Oh my God.

I am never gonna find a prom dress.

Ever.

- I rented The Lost Boys again.

- Yeah?

If you wanna

come over tonight and watch it.

Well, you know I love Kiefer,

but I had to pick up shifts

to pay for my dress.

Are you still going to be my prom date?

I'll need you to survive that suckfest.

- Always.

- Mm-hmm.

Who else would I go with?

Order's up!

- Hey!

- Hello.

Can you scoot over? Um...

It's official.

Student council said that Christy is

the people's choice for prom queen.

- Are you f*cking kidding? She's a skank.

- Yeah.

And her boyfriend's, like, 30.

Wait, wait, but, like,

bad girls are kind of hot right now.

Bad girl? She's a walking Monistat ad.

- Three foot-longs and a cheeseburger?

- I have the burger.

Thank you.

Hey, waitress!

Bring me an extra fries?

Hmm. Coming right up.

Thank you.

That dress is really bad.

- Imagine what she's gonna wear to prom.

- I wasn't gonna say it.

You can't win prom queen

in a heinous dress.

You can't win prom queen

when you're a Granger.

We're closed.

Hi.

Hi.

Oh, you got my jacket.

- Thank you so much. They cost a fuckton.

- Yeah. I'll bet.

- You working late, huh?

- Yeah.

Are you excited for prom?

Um...

Sure.

So you still want to be a writer?

It's not really a thing.

I think it's cool.

Ever since we were kids,

you always had these big plans.

Tiffany and my parents,

they think I'm not gonna

amount to anything.

You know?

Like I'm nothing.

I think everyone feels like that.

That I'm nothing?

You know what I mean.

Yeah.

Well, thank you.

For this.

No problem.

Have a good night.

Bye.

...every dream

To come true

Every dream to come true

You went shopping?

Yeah.

It's for prom.

I used my tips.

All right.

Is your mom still acting weird?

Yeah. I thought she'd be excited

I'm running for prom queen.

I've got a double tonight,

so set your alarm.

She was nominated for hers, right?

Yeah, but they canceled her prom

after my dad.

Maybe it just brings up bad memories?

Hmm... I guess.

Speaking of prom, you get your stash?

Ugh. No.

Christy's supposed to bring it tomorrow.

You could get high and watch my rehearsal.

It would annoy Tiffany.

Please, gag me with a spoon.

- How's the evil witch across the street?

- You mean Tiffany or her mom?

Nancy Falconer.

I don't know which one is worse.

Ain't that the truth?

Dan!

Dan!

Come and look at our beautiful daughter.

Wow!

What do you think?

I think I'm looking

at the next prom queen.

Just be Tiffany Falconer,

and you can't lose.

You know why?

Because you're special.

Repeat after me.

I'm special.

You better believe I am.

I'll get it.

- Hi, Mr. Falconer.

- Melissa.

Hi, Melissa.

Oh my God!

- You like it?

- I love it!

You are so going to win prom queen.

No!

You're going to win prom queen.

You're so much prettier than me.

Oh no, no. I mean,

my... my dress is... is disgusting.

Come upstairs.

I have a ton I don't wear anymore.

Aw.

You two are so sweet.

Let's go.

Hey, little sister

What have you done?

Hey, little sister

Who's the only one?

Hey, little sister

Who's your Superman?

Hey, little sister

Who's the one you want?

Hey, little sister, shotgun

It's a nice day to start again

It's a nice day

For a white wedding

It's a nice day to start again...

Hey, little sister

What have you done?

Hey, little sister

Who's the only one?

All right, dude, what are you?

f*cking Pablo Escobar?

I told you it's the sh*t. Acapulco gold.

Hands off the car.

Want to ride back into town, huh?

It wouldn't hurt. I can fit.

You think I'm driving my baby

into that sh*thole?

Right.

- You think I want to get robbed?

- Well, I'm sorry, Sunnyvaler.

Don't want to get robbed?

Too late. Already paid double.

Hello?

Hello?

Please, no! No, please!

Senior Shadyside students,

don't forget senior prom is coming up.

Tickets are...

So, Christy's a no-show.

Hopefully the b*tch OD'd.

Ouch.

Brekenridge is gonna go nuclear.

She'll kick her out of the competition.

- Good riddance.

- Hmm.

Vote Linda for prom queen.

Linda made flyers?

- No, she didn't.

- Linda for prom queen.

So, where is Christy Renault?

Oh, I don't even think

the parents know half the time.

I hear she's been with an older boy.

Struttin' around in red cowboy boots.

Weekend orgies.

Wowzers.

Wayland.

Really?

King of the jock straps, still?

I thought you got over that

in the fourth grade.

Ooh... Hey, ladies!

Any requests for tonight?

You're looking at Funkmaster Freddie,

your DJ for prom.

Um...

Play some Prince?

- Sure. Prince is cool.

- No, no, no, no. Hey, dickwad.

Don't think about playing

any of that weird sh*t, okay?

You play what I say.

- You gotta be kidding me.

- Whoa. That's the playlist, all right?

Stick to it,

or I'll rip your lungs right out.

Hey, ladies. What's up?

Would the prom candidates

move into the assembly hall?

Let's go up to the stage.

Come on, Lori.

Miss Rogers, back to class.

Christy Renault is absent,

therefore she is disqualified.

Now, let's do a practice run

for the crowning ceremony.

Everything needs to be perfect.

You're gonna win, man.

- No!

- Yes, you are.

I don't care who wins tonight,

as long as it's one of my girls.

- Stop!

- I love you guys so much.

I love you!

Way to go, Lori. I got a few people

voting for you tonight.

Really?

f*ck the Wolfpack. Stick it to the man.

Thanks, Spider.

Miss Granger, you deserve this.

This is your time to shine.

I knew your mother.

It was terrible what happened to her,

to be accused of something so horrible.

This is the new Shadyside.

It's the promise of a bright future.

Perhaps this is your chance

to fulfill that promise.

Ah... Lori!

Hey, hey, hey!

Aw. Working before prom? How tragic.

I just have to say,

I'm so impressed that

you're actually going through with it.

You know,

considering all your nasty family stuff.

My mom said everyone really hated

your mom for ruining their prom.

What's your damage, Tiffany?

I just don't want you

to embarrass yourself, Lori.

Competing at prom

in a second-hand dress and no date? Ugh.

Sure hope you don't make

your whole situation so much worse.

Are we done, Tiffany?

No.

I'm warning you, Granger.

Don't cross me.

You're thinkin' like a fool

'Cause it's a case of do or die...

Hey, Jimmy. Is Christy around?

No, she ain't.

Where is she?

That's what I'd like to know.

She has my prom stash,

and I'm down to my last joint.

- So what am I supposed to do?

- Ugh.

Jeez.

I don't know. I can hardly wait

for the next installment.

You're her prom date.

Shouldn't you know where she is?

- Hey.

- Hey, Lori.

How's it going?

Prom tonight.

Cheeseburger?

And a Coke.

Move over.

More, more, more, more!

Perfect.

Ready?

All right. Okay.

Thank you.

Okay. Bye.

Have a great prom.

Honey.

It's showtime.

I just want you to know,

whatever happens tonight,

I am proud of you.

Thanks, Mom.

Now don't f*ck it up.

Losing prom to a Granger...

Can you imagine?

We'll leave in five!

- Hey.

- Hey.

I was really excited

when I was running for prom queen.

Everyone thought I would win too.

But then with everything

that happened with your father...

Lori...

I'm so sorry you've had

to carry the weight of all that.

I know.

Okay, Mom, I know.

I guess I just thought if I ran,

it's not just for me.

You look beautiful.

Thank you.

This is it, Shadysiders. Senior prom,

the night we've all been waiting for.

And Harmony LaFay,

your favorite school reporter,

will be bringing you

all the drama and excitement,

as well as that

all-important prom queen vote.

With Christy Renault ditching prom...

...the race seems wide open

for Tiffany to take the crown...

Don't forget to vote.

But we do have our underdog, Lori Granger.

Some would say

she's a classic Shadyside tragedy.

A sordid past, a murderous mother.

Can she win over the student body

and prove redemption is possible for her

in Shadyside?

Or is the Granger name cursed?

You have the tells.

Yep, you're better than that.

You know the rules and so do I

A full commitment's

What I'm thinkin' of

You wouldn't get this

From any other guy...

Mom, not in front of everyone.

Devlin, you're still breastfeeding?

The milk of Jesus.

Mmm...

Spider, get me a tight on Brekenridge.

Get me a tight on Brekenridge.

Welcome, class of '88,

to your senior prom!

Oh, uh, and just a reminder, we have

a zero-tolerance policy on alcohol.

Boo!

And recreational dr*gs.

Boo!

Voting begins at 11:00 p.m.

for your prom king and queen.

Let's hear the candidates

introduce themselves.

Remember, your candidates should be judged

on their behavior here tonight.

Vote for the candidate you believe

best embodies the values of this school.

- Tiffany Falconer for prom queen!

- Whoo!

Let the candidates come up to the stage.

Never gonna say goodbye

Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Never gonna give you up...

- Back up, Freddie. Move.

- What're you doing?

Where are the other girls?

Your mom's a f*cking psycho, Granger!

Norman, get the mic. Clear it.

Oh.

What is going on?

Walking like a man

Hitting like a hammer

Shes a juvenile scam

Never was a quitter

Tasty like a raindrop

She's got the look

Heavenly abound

Cause heaven's got a number

When she's spinning me around

Kissing is a color

Her loving is a wild dog

Shes got the look

Shes got the look

Shes got the look

Shes got the look

What in the world can make

A brown-eyed girl turn blue?

When everything Ill ever do

I do it for you

And I go, la-la-la-la-la

Wowzers.

Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na

Na-na-na-na-na-na, shes got the look

Shes got the look

And she goes

Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na...

Jeez, they spiked the sh*t out of this.

Good.

Shes got the look

And she goes

Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na

Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na

Na-na-na-na-na-na, she's got the look

Whoo!

That was pornographic.

Oh, Dolores, it's 1988.

They worked hard on that routine.

Oh my gosh.

- That was k*ller.

- That was incredible.

Even though you were

a bit late on that cue.

I thought I was quite clear

what's expected of you tonight.

They totally f*cked me.

Don't sweat it.

They probably didn't even notice you.

Well, I mean, not amongst

that star-spangled nightmare in spandex.

I need them to notice me.

That's the whole point.

Come on.

You looked smoking hot up there.

Yeah? Did you get the rest of my flyers?

Ah... sh*t. Sorry.

Jeez, Bobby.

Come on.

- Vote Tiffany.

- Are you kidding me? I'm a candidate.

Well, technically,

but you're not gonna win, are you?

Nobody's gonna beat Tiffany.

She's so...

Awesome.

- Perfect.

- I'll tell you what Tiffany Falconer is.

She's a weirdo

who trained her dog how to lick her...

Stop!

Feet.

Tiffany Falconer is an inspiration.

Okay, well, one day they're gonna

catch you wearing that girl's skin.

You're both disgusting and weird,

and that's why you'll get no votes.

None. Nothing.

Everyone was watching you, babe.

You're totally winning prom queen now.

I mean, I didn't know

you could dance like that.

All of us did the dance, though.

Well, yeah, I know,

but, like, you're nice, and you're sweet.

Being nice and sweet

doesn't get you anywhere.

You have to stand out to win.

This is Shadyside.

Nice girls don't win.

Hey.

What the f*ck?

I'm gonna cut the b*tch that did this.

Okay, what's going on?

It's probably the same as*h*le

who screwed with my flyers.

Hey! as*h*le!

Hey, come on, where are you going?

Linda?

Okay, come on.

Messing with me?

Jesus, Linda, you scared me.

Children behave

That's what they say

When we're together

And watch how you play

They don't understand

And so we're

Running just as fast as we can...

Oh no, no, no, no, hey.

What did I tell you, dickwad?

Play that record,

and you'll be sh1tting teeth.

Okay.

Punk.

Freddie, could you play "Gloria" for me?

Go talk to that fifth-year senior.

My hands are tied.

Hi. You remembered your jacket tonight.

Yeah, I did.

That's a really nice dress.

Much cooler than the stars and stripes.

- You think so?

- Yeah.

I do.

Oh my God! It's Tiffany!

Tiffany!

It's Tiffany!

Jesus Christ!

What is going...

Who is responsible for this?

Miss Brekenridge, as if we don't know.

How could you do this?

We have been waiting

all of high school for this night.

Everyone in this room,

this is a very special night,

and you are ruining it!

I literally have no idea

what you're talking about.

You're the only person

that hangs out with this creep,

so you had to know she was planning it.

I didn't.

Miss Granger,

this is not the behavior

of a Shadyside prom queen.

Miss Rogers, we cannot prove you did this,

but be warned, we're watching you.

One more infraction...

Wayland.

Oh, uh, yes.

You're freaks.

Put the music back on.

Lori.

Lori. Okay, now that was my masterpiece.

City light painted girl

In the day...

Lori Granger, really?

Since when do you care

what these people think of you?

I want to win prom queen, Megan.

I want something to change.

And blowing everything

to pieces every time,

it... it makes it worse.

- So I'm the problem?

- I didn't say that.

What do you think this will change?

You can't rewrite the past, Lori.

There are no fairy-tale endings

in Shadyside.

I feel like you,

of all people, should get that.

f*ck. I'm sorry.

Jesus, I need a f*cking joint.

Darken the city, night is a wire

Steam in the subway

Earth is afire

Do-do-do...

Look at her.

Kissing a*s, as usual.

What does Tiffany even see in her?

- Judd.

- Huh? Sorry, what?

Why does everything have to be about

Melissa when I've had her back for years?

I've done literally anything

she wanted me to do.

Nasty sh*t.

I know where the bodies are buried.

Tiffany Falconer better remember that.

Hey, I got you something.

Let's go somewhere quiet

so I can give it to you.

- You think I'm falling for that sh*t?

- No, I really did.

- Really?

- Yes. Yes.

In discord and rhyme

I'm on the hunt, I'm after you

Mouth is alive

With juices like wine

And I'm hungry like the wolf

Stalked in the forest

Too close to hide...

Jimmy.

Do-do-do-do-do...

Lori,

there's a delivery for you in the office.

- A delivery?

- Looks like someone's got an admirer.

Hey, wait up. Have you seen Christy?

What do you think I'm doing here?

I haven't seen her in 48 hours.

I've been with that girl for two months.

I know her better than anyone.

Why isn't she here?

Maybe you should talk to the cops.

I already did that.

Shadyside cops don't give a sh*t.

Why are you so obsessed with this place?

- I'm not obsessed with this place.

- You are. Why do we keep coming here?

'Cause it's sick.

We could sh**t our music video here.

I'm not going to f*ck you

in this dirty basement again.

But, babe, this is our spot.

Wow.

Oh my God.

Judd, is this your mom's?

Don't sweat it. It'll look better on you.

Here, turn around. Let me put it on you.

Lori Granger?

Yeah?

Sign here.

Who are they from?

How the f*ck should I know?

Aw... Baby, I love it.

Uh...

- I'm still not falling for this sh*t.

- Hmm.

We'll see about that.

What else does your mom have?

Did you hear that?

Ah... It's probably just rats.

You know,

Stoker said he found one down here.

It was as big as a...

No.

f*ck!

Roses?

Could anything be more tacky?

Who are they from?

It's none of your business.

Maybe it is.

What do you mean?

I mean, my boyfriend.

All that staring and watching.

Oh, hey, there you are, Tiff.

Hey, Mel.

Lori's been sniffing around Tyler.

Really?

Yeah.

Like a psycho.

And we all know what happens

when a Granger falls for someone

way out of their league, don't we?

Crazy, slutty Rosemary

fell for a beautiful Sunnyvale boy.

You can stop.

I've heard it a million times.

But the boy

didn't really love her, did he?

No, he just hopped across

the tracks when he wanted an easy lay.

So when Rosie's belly got big,

he just bolted in the other direction.

But...

Rosemary followed him.

All right, stop.

And she watched.

And she stared.

And finally, she slit his throat

and left him to bleed out

by the side of a dirty old river.

That's enough, Tiffany.

The police couldn't prove it.

But everyone knew she did it.

And they've talked about it ever since.

And who was Rosemary's baby?

It was little Lori Granger.

Your mom's a murderous freak.

The Granger name is tainted.

And you want to be prom queen.

Hmm.

You're nothing.

You're no one.

Go home, Lori.

Not cool, Tiffany.

Melissa?

What the hell?

Hey!

Hey, Stoker!

What gives?

Could you take a look at that,

please, Mr. Stokeland?

Sure. Why don't I stick the mop up my a*s

and wash the floor while I'm at it?

Uh, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Stokeland.

You having a good night?

Yeah. Night of my life.

This can't be on Judd's playlist.

Judd's vanished.

He's been in your face all night.

Where is he?

Who cares? Ideally deceased.

Are you okay?

Sweet dreams are made of this

Who am I to disagree?

I travel the world and the seven seas

Everybody's looking for something

Some of them want to use you

Some of them want to get used by you

Some of them want to abuse you

Some of them want to be abused...

It's a k*ller look, Lori.

Thanks.

You know, I was meaning...

This is very cozy-cozy, huh?

Hmm.

Melissa?

I'm talking, Tiffany.

Mmm. Now you're talking to me.

- Hey!

- Leave me alone!

Sure. Just give me my sh*t back.

You mean your dress?

You know what? f*ck it.

It's a cheap dress anyway.

You can keep it.

Hey!

Oh, you sad b*tch.

You're a monster.

And you're a slow f*cking learner.

m*therf*cking dance off!

Gloria, you're always on the run now

Running after somebody...

"And now you're talking to me."

Yeah, right.

Like I want to talk to you in that f*cking

polyester itchy dress anyway.

Did your mom do your makeup? I can tell.

If everybody wants you

Why isn't anybody callin'?

You don't have to answer

Oh...

Leave 'em hangin' on the line

Oh-oh, calling Gloria

- Gloria

- Gloria

- I think they got your number

- Gloria

- I think they got the alias

- Gloria

- That you've been living under

- Gloria

But you really don't remember

Was it something that they said?

Just breathe, Melissa.

It's almost over.

Come on!

Sorry, tripped.

Come on, man. Turn it back on!

Hey!

Okay, this is not the night.

Come on, do not f*ck with me right now.

What, did Megan put you up to this?

Help!

Help!

Help!

That's not possible.

Take these dogs away from me

Lori Granger k*lled it.

Do you think Lori Granger k*lled it,

Tyler Torres?

Um...

She did very well.

And Tiffany did as well.

And they're both wonderful.

- You're sweating.

- Excuse me?

What have you got to hide?

What do you need to prove?

You're always telling lies...

That was quite an impassioned performance.

I always knew you were a cut above.

But you cannot give in

to those baser impulses.

I'm not scared

Tonight the streets

Are full of actors...

Sure.

I'm not the only one

who can see your eyes all over her.

What's going on, Tyler?

What about our plans, our...

our future?

Whose plans?

Whose future?

What the f*ck does that even mean?

If you make a fool of me,

this will be the end of you.

We're done.

Hiding from Harmony?

f*ck!

- Spider!

- You scared me!

You secret toker.

You legend. Give me a hit?

- Sure.

- Yes!

They're having the time of their lives.

Hmm.

Seems like it.

You're not digging it?

It's just, you know, the new Shadyside.

When's it all going to go wrong?

Change, man.

It always hurts, hmm?

If I was you

I wouldn't treat me

The way you do...

Hey.

You seen Melissa?

She went to get changed,

but she's not there.

Where the f*ck are my friends?

I can't find them anywhere.

What the f*ck?

Spider, did you see that?

She's just like the others.

They're all exactly... the same.

Where are the Wolfpack?

Where are all the prom queens?

Just a few innocent little ticks.

That little sh*t.

- Hey.

- Hi.

So is it just gonna be

stolen glances all night,

or are you gonna do something about it?

Yeah, how about this?

Lori!

Really, Megan, right now?

I just saw something in the hallway.

Someone in, like, a f*cked-up mask.

And I know how it sounds, okay,

but a whole bunch

of people have disappeared.

Chad told me

that he can't find Melissa anywhere.

And Jimmy said that he hasn't

seen Christy for two days, Lori.

And when was the last time

you saw Linda or Bobby?

And the music changed.

It got really cool, right?

Freddie said Judd's vanished as well,

so you put all that together and you get...

Crazy. You put all that together,

Megan, and you get crazy.

Listen, Judd and Debbie are probably

screwing in the basement like always.

Ew, do you want to give us some room?

- How stoned are you right now?

- Eat sh*t, Tyler. f*ck.

Lori!

Please, just look around.

You and Tiffany are the only ones left.

And earlier, I swear to God,

I heard a scream.

Why are you doing this, Megan?

Because I'm your best friend.

- Because I'm trying to save you.

- Save me from what?

From who?

Who is k*lling the prom queens, Megan?

Maybe Devlin.

- Right.

- Or Stoker. Or Tiffany.

- Or...

- Wow.

Or maybe you just can't stand

that things are finally going my way.

Oh, you have one good night,

and you think that everything changes?

Can't you let me have

just this one moment?

I can't hold your hand forever, Megan.

f*ck you.

Hey, are you okay?

Um, do you maybe want to go

find somewhere more private?

- Yeah.

- Yeah.

I'm not crazy.

I'm not crazy.

I heard a scream.

The lights went crazy.

Spider!

Where's the power room?

Spider!

Huh? Oh f*ck. Uh...

Main circuit's in the basement, I think.

Basement? Judd and Debbie are probably

screwing in the basement. The basement!

Where are we going?

You'll see.

Well, here we are.

Are you okay?

Yeah, I just...

I don't feel great about what happened

back there with Megan.

Don't worry about that.

It's me and you.

Uh...

Look, I... I know that you guys

are really good friends, but...

I just feel like

she's going to keep holding you back.

You know?

Hmm.

- I'm gonna go back.

- Whoa.

I thought you wanted

more than stolen glances.

Megan!

Megan!

Oh, thank f*ck.

- Oh my God!

- Oh my God! Oh my God!

- Judd's dead, all torn to pieces.

- What? No!

- There was Stoker too.

- Tyler! Tyler's dead!

We have to go! We have to go!

Come on!

- No!

- No!

Please let us out!

Please!

Don't go in there! This way!

Oh sh*t.

Oh...

Oh sh*t.

sh*t! sh*t!

We have to go. Go now!

- Okay.

- Okay.

Lori, this way.

Oh God.

Is he gone? f*ck! Okay.

Go. Go.

- Do you know where we are? What the f*ck?

- No f*cking idea.

Look.

Oh God.

Oh Christ, you were right.

I tried to f*cking tell you.

I'm sorry, Megan.

We need to get back to the prom room.

- No. No, no.

- Yes! Yes!

- They're right out there.

- Oh sh*t.

Okay.

How do we get out of here?

What is that?

Oh God.

Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.

f*ck!

f*ck! Where do we go?

Oh my God!

There's a window! There's a window!

- f*ck!

- Help me!

Get up! Grab that end!

f*ck!

Oh God!

Wait, wait, wait!

Take this!

f*ck!

Megan, go! f*ck!

f*ck!

Lori!

Lori!

Lori!

Lori!

Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

It's time, Class of '88!

Whoo!

The votes have been counted,

and the results are in.

And I am delighted to announce...

that your Shadyside

Prom Queen of 1988 is...

You ruined everything, you f*cking weirdo!

Lori Granger!

No. No.

- Claire! Run!

- I hope you're happy, you psychos.

Oh my God! Oh my God!

- Come on!

- What the f*ck is happening?

- No.

- Lori Granger!

Wayland, no! Something is happening!

Really, you need to believe me!

Lori!

Lori!

Wayland!

- There!

- Okay.

Everybody, move!

Get out! Move!

Everybody, get back! Stay back! Stay back!

Okay, easy now.

Megan!

Megan!

Hey, f*ck-face!

Oh my God!

Are you okay?

Who is that?

What the f*ck?

Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!

Ready?

I got his head!

- Hold him!

- I got his neck!

- Daddy!

- We got him!

We got him!

Daddy! Oh...

What the f*ck?

Why, Dan?

Why?

Because I knew how much you wanted it.

Both of you.

But what would it have counted for,

after this?

Nobody remembers the details.

They only remember the winner.

Holy Christ.

He's a mental case.

Somebody call the police.

Hey!

Principal Wayland's still alive.

Wowzers.

Attention all units...

Miss, can you tell us

what happened in there?

Boy, can I ever.

This is Harmony LaFay,

your favorite reporter,

coming to you live from Shadyside High,

prepared to give you exclusive access

into the m*rder, the mayhem,

and the madness

that has happened this evening...

Classy moves with the tiara.

You saved my life.

You saved mine.

I should've listened to you earlier.

What?

You know, I can't believe that I actually

thought things might change around here.

For everyone.

Right.

But you changed.

You won prom queen.

I don't know.

I'm still Lori Granger in the morning.

I can't believe

you're still not owning it.

After everything you've been through.

Come on, young lady. You need stitches.

I'll come with her.

Does this look like a taxi?

It's fine.

- I'll see you tomorrow.

- Okay.

I'll see you tomorrow.

I love you.

I love you too.

Okay.

- Bye.

- Bye.

Ooh, do you have any weed?

- Excuse me?

- Or morphine is good too.

It's a f*cking charnel house

in there. Bodies coming out the walls.

It's worse than '78.

Here he comes.

You need to stay, Nancy.

We need a statement.

What about Tiffany?

We can, uh... we can take her home, miss.

Is that okay?

I, uh... I live across the street from her.

I can ride back with her.

All right. I'll be home soon.

I'm so sorry, Lori.

Don't worry about that now.

I was never good enough.

I always tried so hard

to be everything that they wanted.

To be a winner, but...

inside it all felt like...

I always felt like nothing.

Hey, just take it easy, okay?

Hey, Lori, we can take it from here.

Don't leave me.

I can stay with her for a while.

Is this gonna take much longer?

My daughter's all alone

after the night she's had.

The Granger girl is with her.

Do you have children, Sheriff?

She needs her mother.

She needs her mother.

Jim.

Go ahead, Sheriff.

Come pick up Mrs. Falconer.

Copy that. I'm on my way.

Thank you.

Mommy?

Oh my God!

Lori!

Lori, come on!

How could they do this?

I heard what they did in there.

They said that Judd's face

was cut in half.

And Debbie was fried.

Tiffany, you gotta be quiet.

Can you...

- Can you imagine?

- Tiffany.

The stunned look in their eyes.

The blood...

thumping across broken glass.

Lori?

It was beautiful.

No! No!

No!

There's nowhere to run, Lori.

Do you know what?

I've never realized it before.

But in this final moment of panic...

you really remind me

of your two-faced dad.

Though...

...he cried more.

He was mine first, you know.

Before your skank of a mother came along.

Oops.

Did I forget to mention

that part of the story?

You Grangers are always

taking things that belong to us.

My face was the last thing

that he ever saw.

There's a nice symmetry to that.

Don't you think?

Mommy.

Let me do it.

That is a better idea.

Be my guest.

I warned you.

No one crosses the Falconers.

f*ck!

Mmm.

Mmm.

Mmm.

Hmm...

Help me.

Help...

Help me!

You b*tch.

Trash.

You're nobody!

You're nothing.

Who the f*ck do you think you are?

I'm Lori f*cking Granger.
