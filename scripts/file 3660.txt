Do you think 
we did it this time? 
Yes. 
I think we did. 
Gi, your sister's 
on the phone. 
Okay. 
I'll be right there. 
You know, 
I managed to stop. 
I know. 
I'm gonna stop. 
I'm gonna stop. 
Dr. Hughes 
is gonna smell it. 
Hey. Just calling to wish you 
luck at the doctor's today. 
How are you feeling? 
I'm good. I'm excited. 
What's wrong? 
I just can't stop thinking 
about them. 
About Mom and Dad? 
Yeah. 
'Cause they were 
the last thing I saw. 
Geen-- 
My love, 
we need to leave. 
Um... James says 
we have to go. 
Okay. I'm coming. 
Okay, okay. 
Well, I'm thinking about you, 
and I love you. 
I love you more. Bye. 
Your heart's on a string 
Mmm 
Like pearls in a ring 
Mmm 
It's not 
Over yet 
Pearls drop one by one

James. 
-I'm fine. 
-I know. 
Okay. 
You're more nervous 
than I am. Stop. 
I'm being nervous so you 
don't have to be nervous. 
James, I need to get out. 
Come on, Gi, you got this. 
Come on, please. 
In... out. 
Baby, I can't do it. 
Baby, get me out of here. 
Please, please, please. 
Get me out. I can't do it. 
I'm right here. 
I'm right here. 
There you go. 
Here I am. 
C'est moi, Gina, la cowboy 
C'est moi Gina 
Gina, la cowboy 
C'est moi, Gina 
C'est moi, Jimmy, le pirate 
C'est moi Jimmy 
- There you go. 
- There you go. 
C'est moi, Gina, le pirate 
C'est moi, Gina 
C'est moi, Gina, le pirate 
And now, look left. 
And right. 
And try 
to keep your eye open 
for about 15 seconds. 
Okay. 
I see no reason 
not to do this. 
I'll restore 
optical properties 
of the right eye. 
A corneal transplantation, 
iris reconstruction 
Page 3/44
and intraocular 
lens implantation. 
But you definitely 
can't do the left? 
The optic nerve in the left eye was severely damaged 
in the crash. 
It won't transmit the picture 
to the brain. 
But I'll be able to 
see fully 
with my right eye? 
You'll be able to 
count fingers on day one. 
On day three, 
20 over 200. 
By week four, 
you should be at 20/50. 
That's terrific. 
Come on, 
it's more than terrific. 
That's amazing, huh? 
That is amazing. 
That is the best news! 
There's no risk to Gina, 
though, in the operation? 
The only risk 
is that it won't work. 
Yep. And if it doesn't work? 
We'll just go back 
to how we were. 
It's fine, James. 
How soon can this happen? 
Well, there is 
a waiting list. 
But as soon as a date 
becomes available, 
I will call you. 
Hi, Gina. 
Hey, Lucy. 
Are you ready 
to practice? 
I sure am. 
Are you? 
Page 4/44
Yeah. 
Hey, Gina. 
Hey, Jill. 
-James is not with you? 
-No, he's not. Hey, Ginger. 
He's out 
with some friends 
from work tonight. 
-Oops, sorry. 
-It's okay. 
-Do you mind? 
-Not at all. 
If I could be 
Baby, where you are 
If I could 
Damn it! 
Hey. Hey, hey. Come on. 
Where'd you learn 
to talk like that? 
Let's play again 
from the top. 
Come on. 
I don't like this song 
anymore. 
Okay, what song 
do you like? 
Nothing. 
You like nothing. 
Okay. 
I like to double-dutch. 
That's more like it. 
You like to double-dutch. 
Get over here. 
Teach me an E-chord. 
Where's an E-chord 
on this thing? 
One, two, three. 
That's an E. 
I like to double-dutch 
And dancing too. 
You like to dance? 
Yeah. 
And dancing too 
Time to practice. 
Page 5/44
Please repeat after me. 
Ladies first. 
Good job. 
Now it's the guys' turn. 
Hello? 
Gina. 
Baby! Gosh! 
-What? 
-I got scared again tonight. 
Stupid doors. 
You need your big, 
bad James to come home 
and protect you. 
Oh, yeah. 
Who'd you go out with? 
I went out with Richard. 
From work? 
Yeah. 
Get out of here. Stop. 
You wanna make a baby? 
Huh? 
You wanna make ourselves 
a little baby? 
Mm-hmm, yeah. 
I want a baby. 
I want you to fix 
the balcony doors. 
Those fuckin' doors, huh? 
You know what? 
You're right. 
I'm gonna take my pants off, 
and I'm gonna fix those doors. Go-- Yeah. Go take off 
your pants, baby, 
and then go fix the doors. 
I am. 
That's perfect. 
Where'd I leave 
my tool kit? Huh? 
Where's my tool kit? 
Why do I love you so much 
when you're so terrible? 
You do love me, 
don't you? 
Page 6/44
I just want 
to go to sleep 
right here. 
Does it ever bother you, 
having to take care of me? 
No. 
It makes me 
feel special. 
Hey, Gina. 
It's Daniel. 
Hi. 
How you doing? 
Good. 
You? 
I'm good. 
I just got here, 
so I better get going. 
All right. 
I'll see you around. 
Yeah. 
Thank you. 
I saw you talking 
with Daniel earlier. 
Yeah. 
It really is a shame you're 
blind, because if you could just see the size of his package... Oh, my God. 
I mean, FedEx 
could not handle 
that shit. 
I'm talking width 
and length. 
Stop it. Karen! 
-Shh! 
-Think back to your childhood. Did you ever see 
any male horses? 
Shh. Stop it. 
I'm serious. 
How do you know? 
Shit. Gina, honey, 
there's blood 
on your leg. 
Page 7/44
What? 
I'm gonna get you a towel. 
There's blood on your leg. 
Did it happen in the pool? 
Karen? 
Lucy? 
Hey, what's wrong? 
Sweetheart, 
what's going on? 
Mom's gonna have Ginger 
put to sleep. 
Oh, baby, I'm sorry. 
What's wrong with her? 
Nothing. 
She can't put her down 
if there's nothing wrong 
with her, sweetheart. 
She says she can't cope, 
with me and the baby 
on the way. 
Hey, my love, I'm home. 
What is that? 
What's that? 
Who's your new mama? 
What's Ginger 
doing here? 
I adopted her. 
-You what? 
-Jill was gonna put her down. 
Why? 
She's having a baby. 
What do you mean? 
You can't put a dog down 
because you're having a baby. 
I know. 
That's what I said. 
What's the matter? 
You got your period. 
Ah, shit. 
I'm sorry. 
Don't say sorry. 
I am. 
Don't... 
say sorry, okay? 
Page 8/44
I am. 
You know what? 
Let's go out. 
Come on. 
-I'm okay. Please? 
Oh, my God. 
-Come on. 
Hello, Beijing! 
-Come on, dance with me! 
-I am. I am. 
I'm dancing. 
I'm dancing, I'm dancing. 
That's not dancing. 
Come on. 
I am! 
Whoo! 
I hate dancing. 
I look stupid. 
We all look stupid. 
If you could see yourself, 
you'd see that we look stupid! What's the matter? 
Gina! 
Excuse me. 
I'm sorry. 
I didn't mean that. 
Excuse me. 
You're hurting me! 
Baby, come here. 
There's a fucking pool 
right there. 
Okay, darling? 
There's a pool right there. 
Just stop. 
Come here. 
Please put that away. 
I've got it out now, 
haven't I? Come on. 
Where are the stalls? 
To the right. 
James? 
James? 
-Looking for someone? 
-My husband. 
Page 9/44
What does he look like? 
He's tall with blue eyes. 
Yeah, he, uh, he has... 
-James? 
-Gina. Gina. 
Bye! 
Where were you? 
I was just here. 
No, you weren't. 
I just 
turned my back 
for one second. 
Can I just go home, please? 
Just take me home. 
Okay. Come on. 
I'm gonna have 
a quick shower, okay? 
Okay. 
What the-- 
What the hell? 
Oh! Hey, whoa, whoa. 
Stop, stop, stop. 
What happened? 
There's dog shit 
and piss everywhere. 
Unbelievable. 
Come on, baby. 
Ginger? Come on. It's okay. 
Don't hurt her. 
Why would you do that? 
'Cause I just 
fucking put my sock 
all in her piss. 
We should've taken her out. 
It's not her fault, James. 
One's full of shit. 
One's... 
Gina, it's not funny. 
Stop laughing, Gina. 
It's not funny. 
It's not funny. 
I'm sorry. 
Can you get that? 
Yeah. 
Page 10/44
What is this? 
Hello? 
Is this Gina Lloyd? 
Yeah. 
This is Dr. Hughes' office. 
I'm sorry to call so late, 
but we've had a last-minute 
cancellation. 
I'm gonna be right here 
as soon as you wake up. 
Okay? 
Okay. 
I love you. 
I'm gonna have you 
count backwards from 10. 
10, 9... 
Gina! 
Girls. 
Who wants ice cream? 
Gina! 
Hi. Hello, Gina. 
Hi. 
All right. I'm gonna 
take the bandages off. 
Okay. 
Now, this is gonna be 
just a little 
uncomfortable. 
Okay. 
Keep your eyes 
closed. 
Okay. 
Okay. 
Open your eyes now, 
please. 
Can you see 
my hand? 
Mmm. 
Kind of? 
I think-- I-I think so. 
I don't know. 
Open the curtain. 
This may feel 
a little bright. 
Page 11/44
A little more. 
Gina? 
Geen. 
Gina? 
You know what? 
No. It's okay. 
We tried. Hmm? 
-Promise? 
-Yes. 
I love you so much. 
Yes. 
Yeah? 
I can see. 
Food tastes 
different. 
Well, 
it's hospital food. 
I have taken that 
into account. 
Can I ask 
a silly question? 
What? 
Have you seen 
yourself yet? 
Why not? 
You're beautiful. 
Really, really beautiful. 
You look different 
than what I had 
in my head. 
-Disappointed? 
-No, I didn't mean it bad, baby. I know, I know. 
I just mean different. 
Yeah. 
Good "different." 
Dr. Wanchai, please dial 
extension number 278. 
These are antibiotic drops. 
You need to put these 
in your eyes 
five times a day 
for the next 15 days. 
This is important. 
Page 12/44
I know. 
I'm listening. 
-Sorry. 
-These are steroid drops. 
They need to be taken 
every other hour. 
Mm-hmm. 
We'll taper 
the dosage 
as we go, okay? 
Yep. 
Blue are the steroids. 
Yes? 
Yeah. 
Now, take 
your wife home. 
Watch your step. 
Babe. 
Huh? 
Baby, look at 
all the colors. 
I know. 
I know. 
That's blue. 
Mm-hmm. 
It's just there. 
It's right there. 
What do you want to do? 
Where do you want to go? 
What do you want to see? 
I just want colors. 
Lots of colors. 
All right. 
I know the perfect place. 
You want to see 
some colors? 
If I could be 
Baby, where you are 
If I could be 
Baby, where you are 
If I could see 
Baby, what you see 
Did you see these? 
They look like neon! 
Page 13/44
Then I would know 
Baby, what you know 
Oh, oh 
Just to be 
Baby, where you are 
If I could go 
Geen! 
Baby, where you go 
If I could know 
Baby, what you know 
Then I could see 
Beautiful. Yes. 
Baby, what you see 
Excuse me. Sorry. 
Hi, Ginger. 
Hey, say hello 
to Mommy. 
Hi, baby. Come on. 
Come here. 
Oh, you are ugly. 
What? 
I just for... I forgot 
what my name looked like. 
Okay, 
what's the matter? 
It's just, this is not 
how I imagined it, is all. 
What's going on? 
I don't know. 
I just feel like 
I knew everything before. 
You know? 
Now I don't. 
I've got a surprise. 
What? 
What is that? 
Tickets. Flights. 
South of Spain. 
I got us 
the exact same suite 
we had on our honeymoon. 
Are you serious? 
Then we get a train 
to Barcelona 
Page 14/44
to see your sister. 
Stop. 
And then Luca. 
Stop it. 
And Ramon. 
Wait, can-- 
Can I even travel? 
I spoke to the doctor. 
Everything's all good. 
We're clear to go. 
We leave in three days. 
Huh? I know! 
Look at me. 
Look at me. 
I am. 
Come on. 
I am. 
What? 
Hey, what's wrong? 
Hang on. 
Just one second, please. 
One second. 
Do you want to do 
anything different? 
No, it's not you. 
It's not you. 
It's just... 
It's just... 
We'll be 
in touch soon. 
You'll call me? 
Yes. 
Kitten, 
what are you doing? 
I'm coming. 
I'm just taking 
my drops. 
Come on. 
We gotta get going. 
Okay. 
There we are. 
What is that? 
Are you gonna buy me one? 
Yeah? 
Page 15/44
You want one? 
Blue is 
my favorite color. 
Do you remember it, 
the grass? 
Hmm? 
No? 
No. 
I remember that sound. 
Yeah? 
Yeah. 
And voil. 
Thank you very much. 
Thank you. Just here. 
This is great. 
Thank you. 
Uh, all right. 
It's beautiful. 
It's not the same. 
What's not the same? 
The room. 
It's the exact same room 
we had on our honeymoon. 
No, it's not. 
It is. 
I know you asked for it, 
but they didn't give it to you. You couldn't 
have seen it. 
You were blind. 
What's it have to do 
with anything? 
How could you tell 
this is not the same? 
How could you tell? 
I was here, 
remember? 
Oh, okay. 
It's the exact 
same room. 
Trust me. 
It's exactly the same. 
It may look the same, 
but it's not the same. 
Page 16/44
You're not even 
a little bit scared 
up here? 
It's fine. 
-Oh! 
-Whoa, whoa. Okay. 
How many would you like? 
One each or one to share? 
We're 
gonna share. 
Two. No, one each. 
No. We only had one 
last time. 
Two, please. 
One. 
Two. Two. 
Gina! 
Gina! 
Oh, my God. 
I send you away 
and that's what you 
come up with? 
Who was the guy 
you were talking to? 
It was Ollie. 
He must be European. 
He likes a bit of white. 
Yeah. 
He really does. 
Who is he? 
He and his wife are here 
on their honeymoon. 
They're in the room 
we were in last time. 
-You can't let it go, can you? -Ask the manager. 
Go on. He's right there. 
Why would I ask 
the manager? 
-Ask him. He's the manager. 
-No, no. No, no. 
You could just ask him. 
We're fine. 
I already asked him. 
Page 17/44
Uh-huh. 
Mm-hmm. 
And? 
It's not the same room. 
When were you gonna tell me? 
Truthfully? 
Uh-huh. 
Never. 
Well, I forgive you. 
Jesus Christ. 
They can't see us, 
can they? 
Maybe they like 
being watched. 
Ai-yi-yi. Come on. 
You don't want to 
see that. 
Mmm. 
-Talk to me. 
-Shh. Just feel me. 
Untie me. 
Just untie me. 
-Let me get my hands on you. 
-Stop. 
Oh, fuck. 
You can feel me better 
when you can't see me. 
Come on, just untie me. 
Let me have one hand. 
You get to feel 
what it's like. 
Come on. 
What's the point 
of wearing something like that if I can't see you? 
You don't need to see, baby. 
Use your imagination. 
Oh, God. 
Come on. 
I just want to get 
my hands on you. 
What do you think about 
when you jerk off? 
Hmm? 
Page 18/44
I think about you. 
Always? 
Always. 
Huh? 
What do you think about? 
-I think about you. 
-Just me? And what else? 
Just men. 
Really? 
Yeah, 
just bodies and dicks. 
And dicks. 
So you don't think 
about me? 
Come on. Stop that. 
So you do think 
about other people? 
Are you trying to trick me? 
No, I'm not trying to trick you. Hey, baby-- 
No, don't turn this around. 
I feel stupid enough 
as it is, okay? 
Please. Take it off. 
Take it off. 
I've had enough. 
Take it off. 
I feel stupid now. 
You make me 
feel so stupid. Fuck. 
Untie me. 
Take it off. Okay, come on. 
I've had enough. Please. 
Gina, baby, please! 
Atencin, 
seores pasajeros de tren 187 
con destino a Paris... 
Geen! 
Geen, Geen! 
Geen! Geen! 
Let me see you. 
You've grown. 
Oh, ho, ho, ho. 
Hey. 
Page 19/44
How are you? 
-Look at him. 
-I know! 
Hey, man. How are you? 
Fine. 
Good to see you, Ramon. 
Oh! 
Cutest baby 
you've ever seen? 
Oh, my God. Oh! 
Okay. Whoa! 
No way. Look at that. 
You taught me well! 
Look at my tortilla! 
She looks just like Luca. 
You think so? 
Luca, do we look alike? 
Hang on. 
I think you're right. 
Carla, you can't say that. 
I gave birth to him. 
I can say whatever 
I want. 
When he's bad, he's my boy. 
When he's an angel, 
he's your sister's. 
Stole my entire youth. 
Yeah? 
Let's eat. 
I'm fat, ugly, I don't sleep. 
Hey. 
Luca! 
What about you two? 
Nios? 
What about us? 
Soon. Hopefully. 
Soon? 
Real soon, yeah. 
Practice 
makes perfect. 
Yeah. 
Indeed it does. 
Hear, hear. 
You know? 
Page 20/44
Zambomba, 
pa-pa-pa-pa-pa. 
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa. 
You know how 
to get her pregnant, 
James? 
How? 
Stop putting it 
in her ass. 
I mean it. 
What? 
You can't-- 
I'm sorry. 
I can't believe 
you said that. 
I'm sorry. 
We don't do that, Ramon. 
You don't-- Oh, come on. 
You should. It's great. 
Ask Carla. 
Oh, my God. 
Does it worry you, 
James? 
What? 
Mmm. I don't know. 
Now that Gina can see, 
she might find someone 
better-looking than you. 
This is gonna 
be a long night. 
Okay. Be good. 
You still wanna go 
to the tunnel tomorrow, right? Yes. You keep asking. 
Why you keep asking me? 
I want to make sure 
you want to go. 
Yeah. Yeah, I do. 
You think about it 
a lot? 
I think about it every day. 
I know. 
I think about it too. 
It's just... just go 
Page 21/44
and get it over with, 
you know? 
Yeah. 
Oh, my God. 
I don't know 
how to do it. 
It's perfect. 
What? 
No. She doesn't want 
to wear that dress. 
It's a dress... 
I don't know, 
like a little mermaid. 
You like it? 
Please? 
Please? 
Now! 
I'm a little mermaid 
with my mustache. 
Glub, glub, glub, 
glub, glub. 
Glub, glub, 
glub, glub, glub. 
Just watch me, 
please. 
No one's watching you. 
Because 
if you not watch me, 
I can't leave. 
Could you please 
get in the shower 
so we can go. 
I don't want to be 
waiting for you. 
Just one last dance. 
So I'm going 
To the shower 
Adios. Gracias. 
Adios, mi amor. 
We ready? 
Wow. 
Where'd you get changed? 
In Carla 
and Ramon's room. 
Page 22/44
He's not in there, is he? 
I'm wearing makeup. 
I'm wearing makeup! 
You look hot. 
You look really-- 
Oh, my God, you look hot. 
Sexy. Very sexy. 
What? You're saying it 
like it's a bad thing. 
No, it's not a bad thing. 
I've never seen my wife 
in a dress like that before. 
I guess 
it's not really you, huh? 
We don't really know what me is. Oh. I guess we don't 
really know who you is. 
-You wearing any underwear? 
-Of course. 
Seor! Seor! 
Cigarro! 
Hey, what are you doing? 
Hey, so I heard 
you work in insurance. 
Yeah, 
I work in insurance. 
That's why we're 
in Thailand. 
I got a promotion. 
Is it as boring as it sounds? 
Yes, it is. 
Fuck you very much. 
Hey, hey, hey. 
We should go see 
a show, huh? 
What? No. 
They don't want to go 
see a show. 
Come on. Why not? 
I don't know. 
-James! 
-James! 
What? 
What? 
Page 23/44
Are you serious? 
Yeah. You don't wanna go? 
Peep show! 
Barca! 
You guys go. 
Are you being serious? 
No, you're coming. 
No. Take her in. 
I'll be right here. 
You're not gonna come? 
No. Go and have 
a good time. 
I don't want him to come. 
Good-bye, James. 
Yes! 
You missed out. 
What? What? 
Crazy, man. 
That was unbelievable. 
Why aren't you laughing? 
I'm just kind of... 
Yeah. 
A pussy! 
Pussy! 
Teach him how-- 
He doesn't know 
how to do that to a woman. 
He likes to be 
very proper. 
I can't hear you. 
Oh, hi. 
You know when you said earlier, now that my wife can see, 
am I worried 
that she's gonna run off 
with another man? 
No, don't listen to me. 
No-- 
W-Well, you said it. 
I was joking with you. 
Hey. Hey! 
This guy 
just grabbed my ass! 
-What the fuck 
Page 24/44
is wrong with you? 
-Gina, Gina, Gina. 
What do you think 
you're doing? 
What's going on? 
This fucking guy grabbed my ass! What is your problem? 
Calm down. 
No, you-- you calm-- 
What, 'cause he didn't 
grab your fucking ass? 
You okay? You okay? 
Thank you, Ramon. 
Thank you. 
Gina, what's going on? 
What do you mean? 
I told you. It's fine. 
Ramon 
took care of it. 
Anyone else 
want to grab my ass? 
He's fine with it. 
Hey, you! 
You wanna grab my ass? 
Gina, stop it! Stop it! 
Is there any need 
to humiliate me 
in front of your sister? 
I humiliated-- 
It's my fault? 
Yeah. 
Dimelo otra vez. 
Say it again. 
Say it to my face. 
Can you hit me? 
Come on, mamacita, 
I'm gonna fuck you. 
Okay, you keep the blankets 
for yourself. 
Ready? 
Okay? 
Yeah. 
Hey, Luca! 
Seemed a lot bigger 
Page 25/44
when we were little girls. 
Hey, hey. 
Get back! 
Muere. 
Come on. 
Join us. 
What'd he say? 
He says, "Come in." 
No, no, no. 
Muchas gracias, Luca. No. 
-What'd he say? 
-He said his mommy and daddy 
bathe together. 
Yeah, I bet they do. 
-What's wrong? 
-You don't think 
it's a little weird? 
-Hey! Hey! 
-What? What? 
Having a bath 
with Luca. 
I think it's fucking weird 
you even saying that. Eew. 
Hey. Hey. 
Whoa, whoa, whoa! 
We leave for the airport 
in an hour. 
I think we should find 
somewhere else to live. 
Why? What? 
But I'm happy here. 
I mean, I-- 
I like it here. 
I don't want to move. 
I mean, it's home. 
Do you need a hand? 
Uh-uh. I got it. 
Thank you. 
Yeah? You sure? 
Hold on. Please? 
Just wait. 
Want something else? 
Hmm? Hmm? 
Come on. 
Page 26/44
You should 
take a shower. 
That's it? 
Let me get my hands on you. 
Why don't you untie me? 
What's the point of 
wearing something like that 
if I can't see you? 
- Use your imagination. 
- Oh, God. Fuck. 
What do you think about 
when you jerk off? 
I think about you. 
Always? 
Alway-- 
What do you think about? 
I think about you. 
Just me? 
What else? 
Just men. 
Really? 
Yeah, just bodies 
and dicks. 
And dicks. 
- So you don't think about me? - Oh, come on. 
So you do think 
about other people. 
Are you 
trying to trick me? 
No, I'm not trying 
to trick you. I'm not. 
Hey, baby. 
Don't turn this around. 
I feel stupid enough 
as it is. Okay? 
Take it off. 
Obviously, 
a low sperm count 
decreases the odds 
that one of your sperm 
will fertilize 
your partner's egg. 
Yeah. 
Page 27/44
James, I'm afraid 
it's unlikely you'll be 
able to father a child. 
Wow. 
You and your partner 
could consider 
using either a sperm donor 
or maybe even adoption. 
Oh, boy. 
That's disgusting! 
Lucky, heel! 
How you doing, Gina? 
Oh, it's, uh, Daniel, 
from the pool. 
Yeah, I recognized 
your voice. 
How you doing? 
I'm good. 
Thank you. 
Interesting choice, 
the pink handkerchief. 
Wait a minute. 
Can you see me? 
Yeah. 
No, I had surgery, 
so... 
Wow! 
That is fantastic! 
Yeah. 
What is that like, 
being able to see 
all of the sudden? 
Um... it's-- it's-- 
I mean, it's incredible. 
Wow, that amaz-- 
That's good for you. 
Thanks. 
Would you like to 
get coffee right now? 
Oh, I-- I, um... 
I can't. Sorry. 
That's okay. 
All right. 
Well, I'll see you around. 
Page 28/44
Yes, I'm sure I'll see you 
at the pool or the park. 
Nice seeing you. 
Yeah. 
Lucky! 
Come here, boy! 
Come on. 
Come on. 
Good girl. 
-What are you making? 
-Your favorite-- tom kha gai. 
-Are you ready for a surprise? -I hope so. 
Wait! Don't look yet. 
Close your eyes. 
Open your eyes. 
Wow. 
You're blonde. 
Yes. 
Yeah. 
You don't like it? 
No, it's good. 
It's just different. 
I'm just, you know, 
not used to it. 
-Is that a bad thing? 
-No, it's-- 
It's different. 
Just different? 
I'm just, um, you know-- 
just a bit shocked, that's all. Okay. 
-What's this? 
-The place I'm looking at 
tomorrow. 
What about me? 
I'm working. 
Well, if I like it, 
we can go back. 
Ah. 
All right, miss. 
Tell me some things 
you saw today. 
Um... I saw a rainbow 
Page 29/44
in a puddle. 
That's nice. 
It was the first time I saw it since I was a little girl. 
Here. 
Let me do that. 
I went to the dog park 
with Ginger, 
and there was this really 
butch-looking shepherd, 
uh, but he was wearing 
this pink handkerchief 
and Ginger decided 
to lick his balls. 
- Licked his balls? 
- Yes. 
-What did the other owner say? -Um... 
she didn't say 
anything. 
I guess she has 
a sense of humor. 
You haven't forgotten 
that work event we've got 
coming up next week. 
Mm-mmm. 
Got it in my calendar. 
Oh, Miss Organized. 
You got yourself 
a calendar, huh? 
What do you expect? 
It'd be good, though, 
if you might wear 
something a little less... 
Less what? 
Just something 
a little more, you know-- 
It's a work event. 
Baby, it's all for you. 
I know. 
I just don't want 
the whole department going, 
"Hey, check out James's wife." Did you love me more 
Page 30/44
before? 
When you were blind? 
Uh-huh. 
I could ask you 
the same thing. 
No, I asked you. 
Why blonde? 
So, 
what do you think? 
Oh, I think 
it's amazing. 
I just have to 
bring my husband back. 
By all means. 
It's a great house 
for a family. 
One, two, three. 
I like to double-dutch 
I like to swim 
It makes me happy 
It makes me grin 
I like to double-dutch 
Sorry, baby. 
It makes me happy 
And all I see is you 
Keep it going. 
Hello! 
Hi. 
It makes me happy 
Is that Lucy I hear? 
-Hi, James. 
-You guys rehearsing? 
You sound like 
you're doing really well. 
Guess what? 
What? 
What happened to your eye? 
Nothing. 
It makes me happy 
What happened to your eye? 
It's just sore. I'm gonna 
go see Dr. Hughes tomorrow. 
Gina! 
It doesn't look very good-- 
Page 31/44
What? 
Come here! 
Guess what. 
What? 
I found our house. 
What do you mean? 
I mean 
I found our house. 
-I thought we spoke about this. -Yes, we did, but-- 
What is it? Jesus. 
Look at it. 
Gina, don't. 
I'm gonna get 
a garbage bag. 
It's fine. 
I'm gonna freeze it. 
Carla and I 
used to save their feathers. 
Okay, 
you can relax now. 
There seems to be 
a low-grade rejection. 
What does that mean? 
There's no infection, 
so it should be fine. 
But I'm gonna prescribe you 
a higher dosage of steroids. 
But rejection, I don't-- 
I don't like that. 
Don't worry. 
It's just a slight 
inflammation. 
Baby, it's your sister. 
She's on the phone. 
He said there's 
nothing we can do. 
We just have to wait. 
And I keep taking my drops. 
I just don't think you should 
keep relying on these drops 
if you're getting worse. 
Maybe my eye 
is rejecting 
Page 32/44
the transplant. 
That happens. 
I could be 
one of those people. 
Listen, I don't know 
what else to do. 
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
I'm just-- I'm-- 
I'm worried, you know. 
I know. I know. 
-Will you call me later? 
-Okay. 
Yeah. 
I love you. 
I love you too. 
Okay. Bye. 
What do you think about? 
I think about you. 
What else? 
-Just men. 
-Really? 
Yeah. 
Just bodies and dicks. 
Dicks, huh? 
So you don't think 
about me? 
Oh, come on. 
So you do-- 
I know full well 
the operation was a success. 
I was there. I did it. 
All right, so-- so what? 
My eye is rejecting 
the transplant? 
Are you taking 
the correct dosage? 
Everything you told me 
to take before. 
Okay. 
-Maybe it is the drops. 
-No, I-I doubt that. 
Okay. 
Do you want to check? 
I'll send them 
Page 33/44
down to pharmacology, 
if you wish. 
Okay. 
I'll give you some samples 
in the meantime. 
Use them 
until we figure out 
what's going on. 
Oh, come on, Gina. 
Fuck. 
Baby, what are you doing? 
-Come on! I'm sitting down 
in the taxi, waiting. 
-Just give me a second. 
Come on, honey. 
What's the problem? Huh? 
Forget what I said. 
Put on whatever you want. 
Give me a fucking minute! 
I gave you a fucking minute. 
Please, 
just leave me alone! 
Just get dressed. 
I can't fucking see! 
Oh, my love. 
Stop. 
I'm sorry. 
Come here. I'm sorry. 
I'm sorry. 
Please forgive me, baby. 
I'm sorry. 
I'm sorry. 
Forgive me. Come on. 
Come on. 
We're not gonna 
go out, okay? 
All right? 
We're not gonna go out. 
We're gonna stay right here. 
I want to go. 
No, we're not going out. 
No, no, no. Okay? 
No, no. 
Come here. Come here. 
Page 34/44
My beautiful girl. 
Come on. 
Come on. Come on. 
Come on. 
Come on. 
Yeah, that's it. 
I can't... 
We've dealt with this 
before. 
And we were happy then. 
Come on. It's okay, honey. 
Don't do this. You're okay. 
You're okay. 
Gina! 
Something wrong? 
I don't know. I think 
she's just overheating. 
Come here, girl. 
Just trying to 
cool her down. 
She's okay. 
It happens. She's old. 
What's wrong 
with your eye? 
Oh, um... 
I don't-- 
I don't know. 
Are you okay? 
Yeah. 
You sure? 
Yeah. 
I'm just feeling 
a little stressed 
right now. 
She's my baby, you know. 
Why don't we do this? 
My apartment's 
only a block away. 
Why don't we take her there, 
we'll get her cooled down 
and get her some water. 
Yeah? 
Okay. 
Thank you. 
Page 35/44
-Here. I'll carry her. 
-Let me take him. 
All right. 
Thank you. 
- How's she looking? 
- So much better. Thank you. 
Yeah. 
Gotta be careful 
with these dogs in this heat. 
Thank you. 
Thank you so much. 
She's a sweet girl. 
Yeah. 
I worry about her. 
God. 
She's old now. 
How old is she? 
She's 11. 
Yeah? 
Yeah. 
New for me though. 
I think 
she's good to go. 
Yeah. 
Yeah, she's good. 
You just move in? 
Uh, no, actually, 
I'm moving out. 
I'm going home 
in a couple of weeks. 
Nice. 
If we don't see you, 
thanks. 
So, 
what do you think? 
I think my wife 
has got very good taste. 
I'd like to put in 
an offer. 
Fantastic. 
Is that you? 
Yeah. 
Where have you been? 
I was worried about you 
Page 36/44

finding your way home 
in the dark. 
I'm sorry. I was 
at the park with Ginger. 
She got sick. 
-You gonna come in here? 
-Yeah. 
What's going on with Ginger? 
Is she okay? 
Yeah. She just overheats. 
She's okay now though. 
You might want to 
spend a little less time 
worried about the dog 
and a little more time 
thinking about yourself. 
I got some news. 
What? 
Your husband put an offer in 
on that house that you love 
down by the river, 
and that offer 
was accepted. 
-What? 
-Yeah. 
It's ours. 
-Oh, my... 
-Yeah. 
You know, 
thought it might be 
a nice surprise. 
That's amazing. 
I like to double-dutch 
I like to swim 
It makes me happy 
It makes me grin 
I like to double-dutch 
Hello? 
Gina, hi. 
It's Dr. Hughes. 
The results came back 
and you're right. 
There are inconsistencies 
with your drops you brought in Page 37/44
and the ones I gave you. 
Gina? 
Yeah, 
I-I understand. 
It's very important 
that you only use 
the samples that I gave you. 
Come in and see me. 
Okay. 
Yeah, thank you. 
-Hey, what's going on? 
-Hey, Gina. 
This your apartment? 
Yes. 
-When were you last here, ma'am? -A couple hours ago. 
Hey. 
James, I'm at our apartment. 
We've been broken into. 
Are you okay? 
I'm with the police. 
All right, look, 
I'm gonna come home 
straightaway. Okay? 
All right? Gina? 
Ginger? 
Ginger, come on, baby. 
Come on. Where-- 
Have you seen my dog? 
We didn't see any dog. 
There's a bell. 
You'll hear her. 
Ginger! 
Come on, baby. 
Come to Mama. 
Come on, baby. 
Come on. 
Ginger, come on! 
Ginger, come on, baby! 
Gina! 
Gina. 
Come on. 
Uh, Gina, this is Daniel. 
Daniel, this is my wife, Gina. Page 38/44

Hey, Gina. 
How are you? 
Yeah. 
How are you? 
Daniel walks his dog 
in the park. 
Doesn't he, boy? 
Every day. He said 
he's gonna give us a call 
if he sees Ginger. 
Okay. 
Gave him 
my telephone number. 
Yeah. 
Can you help me 
find her? 
-Mm-hmm. 
-It was nice meeting you. 
James. 
Pleasure. 
Pleasure to meet you. 
And I got your number, 
so if I see her... 
Please do. 
See you guys later. 
I'm not lying to you. 
Please leave me alone. 
You're humiliating me. 
That was the exact same dog 
that you described to me 
with a pink fuckin' bandana. 
You think I believe you're 
out with Richard every night 
when you come home plastered? 
Why do you pretend 
you don't know each other? 
I might be stupid, 
but I'm not blind. 
I could see you knew him. 
Why are you lying to me? 
Because I'm attracted to him. 
Is that what you want to hear? Gina. 
Hey. 
Page 39/44
How are you? 
Did you guys 
find Ginger? 
No. 
I-I tried to call you. 
I'm sorry. 
James? It's you? 
Uh, yes, it is. 
Just gonna get a drink. 
What the fuck. 
Hey, baby, come here. 
I have something 
to tell you. 
Mmm? 
I'm pregnant. 
Hello. 
No one is available 
to take your call. 
Please leave a message 
after the tone. 
Hey, Daniel, 
it's, uh-- it's Gina. 
I'm not sure when you leave. 
I just wanted to, 
um-- to see-- 
Hello? 
Are you upstairs? 
Gina! 
Yeah. 
I'm in the baby's room. 
I'm gonna head out for a-- 
Oh! Oh-ho. Hey. 
Hang on. 
Let me give you a hand. 
-Hang on. 
-No, I got it. 
-Yeah, you got it. 
-I told you, James, 
I have it. 
Watch out. 
I'm going to head over 
the apartment, 
finish picking up 
the rest of the boxes, 
Page 40/44
see what else needs doing. 
I'll see you 
at the concert. 
I thought 
I was gonna drive you. 
No, Jill's picking me up. 
Oh, Jill's picking you up, 
is she? 
Yeah. Lucy and I 
have to be there early. 
Okay. 
Make sure she drives 
nice and safe, okay? 
Okay. 
All right. 
James. 
Yeah. 
Gina? 
Gina. 
"I found your dog. 
I saw that white man 
tie her to a fence. 
I was scared 
to write to you sooner, 
because I knew 
you would want her back. 
I love her 
and want to keep her. 
I really believe in my heart 
that she belongs to me. 
When I look at her, 
she looks back at me, 
and that is called love. 
I know that you are missing her, but I cannot give her back. 
It would make me too sad. 
Sorry." 
Ladies and gentlemen, 
please welcome on stage, 
performing a song 
they wrote themselves, 
Lucy and Gina! 
I like to double-dutch 
I like to swim 
Page 41/44
It makes me happy 
It makes me grin 
I like to double-dutch 
And dancing too 
It makes me happy 
And all I see is you 
Playing tennis 
After school 
Picking flowers 
By big blue swimming pools 
I like to double-dutch 
I like to run 
It makes me happy 
It's so much fun 
I like to party 
With hula hoops 
It makes me happy 
And all I see is you 
And when I'm happy 
All I see is you 
Underneath the sky 
Just you and I 
We count the stars 
As clouds pass by 
Hold each other close 
All through the night 
As time goes by 
Just you and I 
You can see the love 
That's in my heart 
When you look deep 
Into my eyes 
Say good-bye 
For tonight 
In your dreams 
Little darlin' 
We will be all right 
Forever 
In my heart 
In our dreams 
Little darlin' 
We will never part 
Forever 
In my heart 
Page 42/44
In our dreams 
Little darlin' 
We will never part 
Gina? 
Help. 
Help! 
Someone upon that wall 
Is just gonna 
Spend the night 
With my girl 
That's what 
I'm talkin' about 
That's why 
I'm gonna 
Play this shout 
The wall between 
Reality and fantasy 
Sometimes so small 
And not so tall 
The wall between 
Reality and fantasy 
Sometimes so small 
And not so tall 
I've looked 
Into your eyes 
And it should 
Make me feel 
So bright, satisfied 
The only thing 
I've learned 
Is just to fall 
And fall and fall 
The wall between 
Reality and fantasy 
Is sometimes so small 
And not so tall 
The wall between 
Reality and fantasy 
Is sometimes so small 
And not so tall 
Have you ever seen 
The shame in life? 
Smell of deadly colors 
In your sigh 
Page 43/44
Sometimes our life 
Is strange 
And it seems 
You gotta do it all 
By yourself 
To arrange 
Sensations never felt 
That's why my soul 
I'll never sell 
The wall between 
Reality and fantasy 
Is sometimes so small 
And not so tall 
The wall between 
Reality and fantasy 
Is sometimes so small 
And not so tall 
The wall between 
Reality and fantasy 
Is sometimes so small 
And not so tall
