It'll get back to normal.

How long
were you infected?
Four years.
Did you have to be
potty-trained again?
[CHUCKLES]
Are you having
any violent impulses?
No.
Any nightmares?
Good.
They're there to remind
you what you did.
The suffering you caused.
The nightmares mean there might
be something human left.
Makes you wonder about those
that don't have them, huh?

Your sister-in-law,

That's not fair.
My daughter was released.
Whatever she did she can't
hurt anyone anymore.
People need to give
them a second chance.
We've given them
every chance.
They're not integrating. No

They're not

They would if they were
given some choices
instead of being treated like
they were still infected.
Have you seen the news?
The violence?
The vandalism? There's
something wrong with them.
They're not human.

What are your thoughts on the
release of the Third Wave?
I think we can't
take any more.
I think the First Wave
and the Second Wave
have been
a fucking disaster.
No one wants them here.
Not much against them.
Just... just no craic.
- Yeah.
- You know what I mean?
They just mope around.
Bit of a hum

My uncle came back

He killed himself

They're out there,
right now.
Infected, Cured,
they're all the same.
Wipe the fuckin' lot of them
out, that's what I say.
The government now face
a very difficult dilemma
of what to do with
the 25% of infected
who remain resistant
to the cure.
I mean, what they did..
I mean..
How do you get over that?
Repent!

Hmm. Great job.

Hi.
I don't have to stay.
It's what.. It's what
Luke would have wanted.
Besides... technically
it's your house.
It hasn't changed at all.
I was... gonna hire
an interior designer,
but, um..
They all got eaten.
[CHUCKLES]
Sorry.
I thought that maybe if you made
it you would have gone home.
Cillian was born here.
And only uninfected US
nationals are considered.
I guess we're a risk.
Did they give you a job?
There was a..
...an opening
at the treatment center.
Why would you
wanna stay there?
It's just being
a porter again.
Luke always said you were
wasting your time with that.
Were you with him?
At the end?
We got separated.

Good girl.
She's not attackin' me.
It's the same reason you
can't get chicken pox twice.
Once infected, your cells retain
a trace of the Maze virus.
She thinks
you're one of them.
- Where are the others?
- I don't have access any more.
They've allowed me to
continue caring for her.
She's all that matters.
We have to cure her.
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
How could you

Despite condemnation

the Irish government

The Taoiseach has called
it an act of mercy

You.
- Hmm?

Can't we work

Okay.

[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
I was in prison.
This is worse.
We're treated

It's right that

I mean.. What we did..
Why?
Why is it right
that they're scared?
They're not
the ones living here
having their every

We need to march.
We need to stand up
and say..
[SIGHS]
You didn't tell her.
[SIREN BLARING]
You were right to lie.
They're all the same when
they know the truth.
They just want us
to continue
killing ourselves,
and solve the problem..
Did you see them?
The Resistant
don't attack us.
[DOOR OPENS]
They think
we're still infected.
What does that mean?
Means we're safer
with them than the rest.
[EXHALES]
Move.
You've been
skippin' work.
I'm not a cleaner.
[CHUCKLES]
You know..
...I knew people
like you..
...before the outbreak.
They thought the world

was theirs on a platter.
Lookin' down on
the rest of us.
But here... now..
...I'm in charge.
I decide whether your life
is happy or miserable.
You just have to

Abbie. How's it going?
Did you get my footage?
The withdrawal's

whatever talks they're

Yeah, yeah, I got it,
but look, um..
It's just not a story of

No, it's too soon,
I'm telling you
the country isn't ready.
The Resistant
are still alive
it's not safe yet.
Tell that to

Look, I... I do have
something for you to cover.
The first McDonalds

I need some coverage.

Sorry, I'm a friend

Anyway, it's nice

Was Senan with
you last night?
[SEAGULLS SQUAWKING]
It must have been tough.
Raising a child alone
through the outbreak.
I managed.
Of course.
I didn't mean

I'm sorry.
It's just force of habit.
I guess being a cleaner wasn't
your top career choice, huh?
[CHUCKLES]
No.
I'm a barrister.
I was actually running for
election before all this.
Well, maybe you can
run again.
No, I doubt it.
It's nice
to have your vote.
How did you get that?
This?
Um, I was late for work.
You have to complain.
The guy we complain to has a
pretty decent right hook.
What was it like?
Quarantine?
No, before that.
Why don't you ask Senan?
I can't.

Everyone says it's hell.
It's like being trapped

But what they

We have to redirect

Joan... I fear
your personal loss
has clouded your judgment.
But I would ask you,

There was so much chaos
after the Outbreak.
It was two years before we could
begin to re-enter the city.
We started to hear
a rumor of a cure.
I actually convinced myself
that Luke was infected.
Just... waiting
to be rescued.
And then I came home.
I thought they'd cleared

Hi.
I'm Conor.
I'm a friend

Cillian, bedtime.
Now, please.
He's a good-looking boy.
I can see

I called earlier,
but you weren't in.
Where did you go?
Killiney Hill.
Oh. Nice.
It's good to
see you bonding.
It must be tough at the accommodation
center after the bombing.
At least they
arrested someone.
She didn't act alone.
Well, there's a lot of
anger out there, you know?
Particularly
with the Elimination.
Maybe it's for the best.
Dr. Lyons will
find a cure.
- And what if she can't?
- She needs time.
And one of them gets out, and...
and we're right back there.
We're all in danger.
Not all of us.
It's late.
You need to go.
Can I ask you something?
Do you think
we deserve forgiveness?

Page 21/41

Yes.
And if you were faced with the
man that killed your husband..
...would you forgive him?
They weren't in control.
I'd better check
on Cillian.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to
upset you.
You didn't.
She takes you in and suddenly
you forget about us?
You told me
they were empty targets.
There's always
casualties, Senan.
We're dying every day
because of them.
I'm not gonna be
a part of this anymore.
I have to look after them.
You think you can
just shut the door
and pretend it's all okay?
You're the reason...
they're not safe.
They'll find out
eventually.
[PANTING]

Sweetheart, can you go

Okay.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

I'd never fall off.
[BIRDS CHIRPING]
- Aah..
- Yeah.
I just wanted to check to make
sure that he wasn't late.
[CAR APPROACHES]
Yes, thank you. Bye.
[CAR DOOR OPENS, CLOSES]
What's this about?
It's customary to check in
with families
to see
how everything's going.
So, how is Senan
settling back in?
Well.
It's natural for there
to be problems at first.
Everything's fine.
You know, I have to say..
...I think it's brave
of you
to take one back in.
Especially with a young
boy in the house.
They can be aggressive.
And it probably
doesn't help that their
rehab officer kicks
the shit out of them.
You've met Conor.
The alpha of the pack.
They're friends.
From quarantine.
Is that
what they told you?
We try to make ourselves
feel better
feel safe, by saying
it wasn't their fault.
They're just
mindless monsters.

Page 23/41

But the Infected
aren't mindless.
They hunt together.
They communicate
with each other.
They decide who to kill..
...and who to infect.
They're connected in a way
that we will never understand.
What do you want from me?
I want you to contact me.
If you think there's
anything I should know.

You were involved

You can't link me
to any violence.
So you're denying it?
All I've done is
tried to help people.
It's not just
for the power then?
Now, look at
how they treat us.
Look at how we're
forced to live
what choice do we have?
You have the choice
not to eat people.
[CHUCKLES]
Well, there's the thing.
We're not
the only killers.
We're just the ones
being reminded of it.
I want you to stay away
from me.
And stay away from Senan.
Senan... is my family...
Why? Because
you killed together?
'Cause you're a pack?
That's not a family,

Sit down.
They took Jo.
We're gonna save her,
Senan.
If we have
one of the Resistant
they'll have to
take us seriously.
No more bombings,
no more violence.
What about the military?
Mm?
People could get killed.
It's mainly
defense volunteers left.
Scouts have
better trainin'.
You don't know what the
fuck you're talkin' about.
Joan, you can't agree
with this.
I have to save her,
Senan.
They're the same as us.
We can't stand by
and do nothing.

Down. Get down.
- Get down. I said stay down.
- And the rest of them.
Get up against the wall!
Go look in the basement,
there are more in there.
Where are they off to?
Where are they going?
Where?
[CILLIAN LAUGHS]
[SEAGULLS SQUAWKING]
I told you
to stay away from us.
Senan told me
about the break-in.
I wanted to make sure
you were okay.
I know it was you.
You know,
for a while there
I thought you and I,
that we had something.
But it turns out you're
just like everybody else.
Scared.
And the truth is,
you're right to be scared.
No matter how much
we pretend..
...we're not
the same people anymore.
All because daddy
wouldn't get you a job.
You know,
I met your husband once.
Bless him,
he tried his best.
You're lying.
You should ask
Senan about him.
It's all very

He doesn't care

- He infected you!
You have to give me
something.
Before it's too late.
Before the withdrawal

I can help.
I can help your family.

Hey.
I'm sorry
I didn't come home.
What's wrong?
What happened to Luke?
How did he die?
- Abbie..

I thought it would be better
if you didn't know the truth.
[SOBBING]
What happened?

- What good will it do?
- Tell me!
We were here.
We..
Luke thought that..
...maybe you'd been
trapped here.
But you'd already gone
by the time we got here.
Then there was
an Infected.
And he attacked me.
Conor.
Yeah.
Luke tried
to fight him off.
But it was too late.
And then he barricaded
himself in the bedroom.
I wasn't in control.
Believe me,
I... I didn't know
what I was doing, and...
How could you not tell me?
How could you sleep here?
- I'm so sorry...
- Get out!
Get the fuck out!
Get the fuck out!

Following the recent
outbreak of the Maze
virus in Ireland,
the country is beginning
to regain control
once again.
People are desperately
trying to track down
loved ones, suspected
to be amongst the 8000
newly Infected cases..
Outcry against the humane
elimination is growing
with families joining
the Cured Alliance who
are leading the protests
against the government.
The government
have agreed that
continuing
the humane elimination
is the only option
available
if we are going to
stamp out this infection
once and for all.
..the government
are preparing to declare
Ireland Infection free.
We've obtained evidence
that a cure
for the resistant strain
was perfected
by Doctor Joan Lyons.
Now, either
the government knew this

Page 39/41

and covered it up,
or they rushed
into the
clean-up missions
without considering
any options.
The people of Ireland
deserve better
they deserve
true leadership
that is there
for the many and not...
Sorry, we have
to interrupt here.
We're receiving
breaking news.
Despite reports,
camera traps
have discovered pockets
of Infected still
remaining in the west
of the country.
The footage shows
at least 20 infected
but the exact figures
have yet
to be determined.
The government has just
released a statement
assuring those in
the area that a military
platoon will be
dispatched
to evacuate them.
Now this begs
the question
if the military failed
to detect these Infected
how many more of them..
