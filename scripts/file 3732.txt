- Hello?

Hello?

- Oh, sh*t!

- Oh!

- Scared the, scared

the sh*t out of me.

I wasn't expecting

you till seven.

- Yeah. Sorry, I

didn't wanna be late.

- It's Gwen, right?

- Yeah. Gwen Taylor.

- Right. Teddy.

Teddy Miles. This is my place.

I appreciate you saving my

a*s on such short notice.

- Yeah, of course.

- Yeah.

- I noticed the window in

one of the rooms was open.

Cabin 18, the wind was

blowing at the door.

- Maybe you think you should

get a new quarterback. Geez.

So you just moved

to the area, or?

- Mm-hmm. From Ashford.

It's not too far.

- By yourself, or you

got family around here?

- No, I'm on my own.

- Oh.

- You said on the phone

that this was a cash job?

- Yes. Straight in your pocket.

Yeah, I mean, hell, if

you take to the job,

then maybe we could make it

a regular thing, you know?

- Really?

Wow, that'd be great.

- Carmen usually works nights,

but her kid's been

getting pretty sick.

- Oh. Yeah, that's terrible.

- Yeah.

I would normally

work the double,

but I just have this

thing that I can't miss.

It is with a girl, so.

- f*cking Yogi, don't

do this to me.

Sorry, that's Yogi.

Yogi, come on.

Why would you do this today?

- [Gwen] Oh, here.

- Oh. Hey, thank you.

Really gotta get this

thing fixed. Oh my.

Oh, heavy. Oh, let's see.

Look, I know it looks as

if the damn Addams family

used to live here,

but trust me, they,

they did not.

They never lived here.

This place is harmless.

It actually belonged to my

grandfolks way back when,

but we haven't quite

updated it since, so.

You know, I got, like,

crazy, crazy plans

for this place.

I'm talking some big-a*s

plans for this place.

I'm just waiting on a

loan approval. Right?

And then as soon as that

comes in, I'm going to,

I'm gonna remodel

Miles Ahead Motel.

What you think?

- Looks good.

- Yeah, it could

be pretty sweet.

It's already got

five stars built in,

so that's covered.

And hell, who knows?

You know, if business booms,

then maybe get a

franchise out of it.

Like, that'll be, yeah. Yeah.

Let me give you the tour.

And we don't get that many

guests this time of year,

truth be told.

Mostly folks just passing

through to Denning.

Now, we got 20 cabins.

All are basically identical.

Okay, so queen bed,

mini fridge, phone.

You know, it's not much,

but it's a place

to rest your head.

And standard-definition

television.

Okay. Let's see.

Shower, toilet, all

pretty much standard.

So, already cleaned cabin 12,

but eight still

needs some doing.

- Okay, cabin eight. Got it.

- Right. You need me to

show you the ropes, or?

- I think I can handle it.

I did notice, however, that

you don't do a French fold.

- A French what?

- If we drape the banding back,

the finished side

will be exposed.

Not only will the bed

look more comfortable,

but the guests will feel the

softness when they climb in.

- Well, sh*t, now I want

to jump in that thing.

I wanna take a nap right now.

- Yeah. My mom used

to work in motels.

I used to help her out

after school sometimes.

- Okay, here we have

the supply room.

Oh, don't forget

to use this brick.

Now, the door only

opens from the outside,

and this brick will keep

you from getting locked in.

It is very, very important.

Okay. So linens are kept

up here, towels down below.

More cleaning supplies above

the washer-dryer combo.

Fuse box right over

here. What else?

Just give me a second, okay?

Sinkhole last summer.

Been on the phone

with the county

for months trying to

get them to close it.

Assholes are finally

coming this weekend.

- I've never seen one before.

- Yeah. Sucked all the

water in the damn ground.

Luckily, nobody

was swimming in it.

- Teddy, how come

cabin 13 is only 45.50?

That's half the price

of the other rooms.

- Oh, superstition.

- You can't be serious.

- It's the same reason

why flights are cheaper

on Friday the 13th,

or animal shelters are

overrun with black cats.

People are f*cking stupid.

They will believe anything.

Have you eaten?

- Not yet.

- Well, Postmates don't

come out this far,

and the wifi is a little janky,

but if you're in the

mood for some k*ller pho.

- It's pho-king delicious.

- Yeah, it's the best

Vietnamese in town.

It's the only Vietnamese

in town. Yeah.

So, I do believe that is,

that's everything.

- I have to ask.

What kind of security

do you have here?

- Security?

Oh, we have, I mean,

we have a monitor on the desk.

- Oh. I mean, protection.

This hotel is a ways out, and

I'm a woman alone at night.

What if I get some

as*h*le guest?

- Oh, just call the police.

- Yeah and wait, what, 30

minutes if they even show?

- Well, if you want,

there's a fire ax next

to the vending machine.

Nobody's gonna mess with you

if you swinging that

thing around,

you know what I'm saying?

They might call the

police on you, so.

Okay, Gwen.

Relax, okay?

I know it seems a little

spooky, but trust me,

I haven't had any trouble here,

and neither has Carmen.

But I tell you what,

if you feel unsafe or

threatened in any way,

there's a deadbolt

in the parlor.

Just lock yourself

in there and then,

you know, just call me, okay?

Trust me, Gwen,

you're gonna be fine.

- Is that rats?

- Hmm.

Tell me that's not rats.

- Oh, no, that's not rats.

Okay, that's rats. That is rats.

Okay, I'll tell you what.

Pho is on me, okay?

You ain't gonna eat that much

pho, so I'll just take this.

Whew, it's chilly tonight.

Okay, Gwen, I will see

you in the morning.

7:00 A.M. okay?

And Gwen, welcome

to the night shift.

- Ms. Marsh.

Ms. Marsh?

My name is Gwen. I just

started the night shift.

I'm taking over for

Mr. Miles, the manager.

You're just staying the

one night, is that correct?

Hi. I just wanted to make

sure you were all right.

Do you need anything?

Fresh towels, perhaps?

- No.

- Okay.

Well, if you change your

mind, just give me a call.

I'll be in the office

most of the night.

Oh my God.

Gross.

Ew. Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.

Ew.

Sorry to keep you waiting.

Hello?

- [TV Reporter] Labored

by these lawsuits

and with their stocks

continuing to crash,

the company has now been

forced to file for bankruptcy.

In other news,

authorities have yet

to apprehend a

convicted m*rder*r

who escaped a facility

Wednesday evening.

Police are asking

residents in the area.

- [Gwen] Yeah, can I get the...

Pho Thit, the Pho Thit Lon?

I don't think I'm

saying that correctly.

The one with the pork.

Yeah. And not too spicy, please.

Great, thanks.

Oh, f*ck. I need coffee.

This is The All Tucked

Inn, how may I help you?

Hello?

sh*t.

- It's for you.

- Excuse me.

This is broken. Are you okay?

Are you okay?

- There's gotta be

one in here somewhere.

You have to excuse me. It's

my first night working here.

- Oh, no, that's fine.

You said your name

was Gwen, right?

- Mm-hmm.

- Well, I'm Alice.

What did you see in there?

- What?

- In the cabin. Number 13.

- Oh. Yeah, I've barely

slept in nearly 20 hours.

I literally just moved

here and started this job,

and my mind is pretty

scattered right now.

And with this place

looking the way it does,

the taxidermy and the old pipes,

I, um...

I thought I was hearing

things, seeing things.

- That's a shame. I do

love a good ghost story.

Listen, I hope I didn't

come off as rude earlier

when you knocked.

I was a little upset.

- Yes!

Found one.

- Oh, great. Thanks.

- No, no, no!

Oh, sh*t. It's locked.

- Wait, what? Don't you

have a key or something?

- No.

It can only open up

from the outside.

We're stuck.

- Hey! Help us!

Someone help us!

We're locked in here!

Let us out!

- No one else is staying

at the motel, no

one can hear us.

- f*ck.

- Wait, do you have

your phone on you?

- No. That's why I

needed the dryer.

It fell in the f*cking sink

when I was dyeing my hair.

What time does your

manager come back?

- 7:00 A.M.

- [Alice] Oh, no, no, no,

no, no, no, no, no, no.

- [Gwen] Hey, hey,

hey! It's okay.

- No, I'm claustrophobic.

- Okay. Just, just calm down.

Just breathe.

- [Alice] No. Ah, what is that?

There's somebody else in here.

- [Gwen] There's nobody in here.

- [Alice] No, no, no. There's

somebody else in here.

I felt something thing.

- Okay, stay behind me.

- You all order the pho?

- Hey, let us out of here!

- What?

- [Gwen] Open the f*cking door.

- Ah, sh*t.

- What?

- I got you the wrong order.

- Mm. What was this one?

Pork?

- I don't know what it

is, but it's delicious.

- Thank you, for the food.

- Are you kidding?

Mr. Miles paid, and he owes us

after the sh*t we just

went through.

How he has managed to

keep this place open,

I will never know.

- Hmm.

- So why red?

- Uh...

It's my mom. She never

lets me do anything.

Dye my hair, go to parties,

watch horror movies.

We got in this big

argument. I left.

Doesn't really know where I am.

- You ran away from home.

- Well, I'm not going back.

- Where's home, your mom?

- Umm...

Denning.

Yeah. No, it's a sh*thole.

Yeah, it's so boring.

- Alice, I know you

don't want to hear this,

but your mom is just

trying to look out for you.

- Oh.

- She must be worried sick.

- No, no, no, no.

You don't know her.

She's a b*tch.

One time, Hobie Kittredge

gave me a hickey,

and she like, grounded

me for a month.

- Yeah, my mom was the same way.

She was tough as hell

on me, super strict.

My younger sisters, they got

away with it, but not me.

But family matters.

Listen, Alice,

it's dangerous to be

on the road by yourself.

The world can be a scary place.

There are bad people out

there doing bad things.

Anyway, I just think

you should reconsider

what you're doing.

That's all.

My mom, she passed

away a while ago,

but I still miss her.

- Yeah, think, she's probably

trying to reach me now.

- Do you want a Coke?

f*ck yeah.

- Oh, sh*t.

- Jesus.

- Sorry, I didn't

mean to scare you.

- No, it's okay.

Sorry, I'm just a little

spooked from the rats.

- Oh, yeah. Here, no,

let me help you out.

- It's okay. Don't worry.

- No, it's okay.

It's really no bother.

- It's okay. It's fine.

I said I got it.

I don't want you

to cut yourself.

- Well, thank you

for dinner again.

I'm gonna go and try

this out on my phone.

See if I can get it to work.

- Yeah, good idea.

Alice.

Don't forget to lock

your door, okay?

- Yeah, always.

- f*ck.

Goddammit, Yogi.

What the f*ck.

- [Birdie] Jesus Christ. Warn,

look at this dump!

- Welcome to The All Tucked

Inn, how may I help you?

- Dead birds. Dead

f*cking birds.

I told you, didn't I say so?

- You totally did.

Oh my God.

- Ma'am. Ma'am, please

don't touch that.

- She can touch

whatever she wants.

Hi. Now, we would like

your very best room.

We just escaped

a gallery showing

that was absolutely

f*cking rudimentary,

and we want to still

enjoy ourselves

so this night is

not a total waste.

- My idea, of course.

Let's stop in a seedy

motel just like they do

in the movies!

- Sure. How long would

you like to stay?

- I guess, I don't know.

We'll stay for the full hour.

- You'll only need 10 minutes.

- Birdie, play nice.

- Sir, this isn't that

kind of establishment.

We don't rent rooms by the hour.

But if you'd like,

I could book you into

a cabin for the night.

- Oh my God. Wait, are

you f*cking kidding me?

Don't...

Don't tell me people actually

sleep in this sh*thole.

- It's a nightly charge,

sir. 91 even per room.

- Oh my God, we have

the cash, Warn.

Just pay the girl.

- It's not about

the money, Birdie.

So are you really telling me

that you will not rent

us a room for an hour?

- I can't. It's against policy.

- My God. sh*t.

How does this f*cking

dump even stay open? God.

What kind of salary do they

even have you on here, huh?

- Easy, Warn. Come on.

- Look at her. Hey,

mm-mm, look at her.

Look at my wife.

She is a f*cking goddess.

Do you think I would

ever let her sleep

in this disease-ridden pigsty?

Hmm? This sh*t

stain for a motel?

I mean, people have

probably died here, right?

Been m*rder*d.

- Like I said, it's

91 even per room.

- Fine, just say what you

want. What do you want?

Do you want 100? There's 100.

Fine. You know what, why

don't you just take 200.

- Like I said, it's just $91.

- [Warner] Why don't

you take 300, right?

350, 4, huh? 400.

- Sir, please stop.

- Jesus Christ! Just give

me my f*cking room key.

- Room two.

Would you like me to

show you where it is?

- Let me guess, it's

between one and three.

Then I think we'll

manage, won't we?

- [Birdie] Warn.

- [Warner] What, baby?

- I got glass in my Prada.

- Oh.

- f*ck. There's shards of

glass all over the floor.

- All right, come on, come

on, come on. Let's go, baby.

Here we go. Let's go,

let's go, let's go.

- Sorry, I just, I need you

to sign the registration book.

- Yeah, well, f*ck you

and your stupid book.

[Warner] Ow!

Oh. Ow!

Ow.

Ow.

sh*t.

- Gross.

Help, help me! Help me!

- [Alice] Here! Gwen, here!

- Gwen? What is it?

What's wrong?

Gwen.

Okay. What'll it be?

Russia, Ireland, or Jamaica?

- Whatever's strongest.

Thanks.

- Nostrovia.

Oh.

You saw something

again, didn't you?

In the pool. What'd you see?

What'd you see?

- I...

I--

- You know this place

is haunted, right?

- What?

- Yeah, it's like,

one of the most haunted

locations in the state.

It's actually like, part of

the reason why I came here.

It's notorious, really.

I heard like, a

sh*t ton of stories.

I just wanted see if they

were true, you know.

sh*t.

- Jesus Christ.

- [Birdie] Stop!

- [Warner] All right,

hold on.

Oh.

- Alice.

- Yeah?

- Have you seen a

strange car lurking

around the motel tonight?

- Lurking. What do you mean?

Gwen, are you okay?

- When I was your age,

a man named Walton

Grey, a loner,

broke into our house.

He k*lled my mom and my sisters,

and he tried to k*ll me.

I was the only

one that survived.

- Jesus.

- They caught him,

and they locked him

away in an institute,

but two days ago, he escaped.

- Are you serious?

- I found this in my mailbox.

It's a necklace my mom gave me.

It went missing the night

Walton Grey k*lled my family.

I always believed

that he took it.

- Holy sh*t.

- I was so scared, Alice.

I just, I left. I ran.

But he's followed me.

I saw him.

- What you've seen him? Tonight?

- Twice, outside.

- Gwen, are you sure it was him?

Because you said you haven't

been sleeping a lot lately.

- I don't know. I think so.

I don't know what

I'm seeing here.

This place is just

so f*cking strange.

- Yeah, yeah. No sh*t.

Look, I think you

should call the police.

You know, for your

own safety at least.

- Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

Alice, I need you to

do something for me.

I want you to keep this

door locked, just in case,

and I want you to stay

inside, all right?

- Yeah, of course. You got it.

Gwen?

I, um...

I thought about what you said,

and I'm going home

in the morning,

back to my mom's.

Family matters, right?

- Hello?

What the f*ck.

- Just met this b*tch.

Gwen, slow down.

Okay. What happened?

- You never told me this place

was f*cking haunted, Teddy.

- [Teddy] What? Haunted?

- Don't play dumb

with me, as*h*le.

I'm...

I'm seeing things.

Ghosts, Teddy.

- Oh God, Gwen.

Okay. Is the place a

little f*cking old?

I'll give you that. Is

the place a little spooky?

Sure.

- A little?

- Look Gwen, what I'm

trying to say is,

Gwen, it's not haunted, okay?

It's just not.

- You're telling

me, swear to God,

that you've never seen

anything at this motel.

- No. Uh-uh.

- Swear to God, Teddy,

you've never seen anything?

- Nothing, Gwen.

Nothing, I run a clean

ghost-free establishment.

If there were ghosts,

I would know about it.

Don't be ridiculous.

- You're lying to me.

- I'm not lying. I swear.

- You know what,

this place is a f*cking

horror show, Teddy.

I should sue your a*s.

I got...

I got f*cking

ghosts, I got rats,

I got a weird sex couple

wearing bird masks.

- Okay, I don't know

nothing about no bird masks.

- I'm not coming back.

Teddy, you hear me?

This is my last g*dd*mn shift.

- Gwen, Gwen, Gwen, come on now.

- I am done.

- Don't do that.

Don't do that, Gwen.

- See your a*s at seven.

- Gwen, don't. Gwen, don't do--

- [Visitor] Hello?

- Sorry to keep you waiting.

I was--

- I'd like a room.

- How long would

you like to stay?

- One night. Been a long drive.

Don't I recognize

you from someplace?

- I don't think so.

- Hmm. You must have

one of those faces.

- That's what people

keep telling me.

It'll be 91 for the night.

- Cheap.

Really cheap.

Here.

- Why don't I put you in...

Cabin 12?

- Are you gonna

show me to my room?

- Yes, certainly.

Actually, why don't I put you

in cabin eight?

It's just been freshly turned.

- Sure. Sounds good.

- Here we are. Queen bed.

There's a mini fridge.

There's a phone

on the desk there.

- I didn't catch your name.

What did you say it was?

- The towels.

I just need to make sure

you have clean towels.

- Oh, f*ck.

Gwen, don't you know who I am?

- You're Walton Grey.

- My name is Raymond Bailey.

I'm your doctor.

- What?

- You've been under my care

at Ashford Psychiatric

Facility for 12 years.

Two nights ago, you escaped.

- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

No, you're lying.

You are Walton Grey, and

you k*lled my family.

- No, Gwen.

You, k*lled your family.

Do you remember

what you told me?

Huh? How they mistreated you?

How they hated you?

You were the family stain.

What did you do to your family?

Gwen, do you remember?

- No.

No, no, no, no.

No.

Walton Grey k*lled my family.

- There is no Walton Grey.

You made him up.

His name, it's an

anagram of your name,

Gwen Taylor.

He's a figment of

your imagination.

You need your medication, Gwen.

You're not well.

I uh,

I called the hospital,

once I knew I'd found you.

See, the necklace. The necklace.

Remember?

You told me that you

wore it the night

that you k*lled your family.

You told me it was the only gift

that your mother ever gave you.

Remember you telling me that?

Gwen, Gwen, Gwen, Gwen, Gwen,

Gwen, Gwen, Gwen, Gwen, Gwen.

Gwen, listen to me.

Listen to me, Gwen.

I need you to hand

me those scissors.

Please, hand me the scissors.

Hand me the scissors.

Gwen, put--

- Open your f*cking mouth.

- You sure this is the place?

- The All Tucked Inn.

That's what the doc said.

- Well, maybe you

give them a call.

This my motel is sh*t.

- That's her. What

the hell is she doing?

- Come on, let's go.

- sh*t.

Come on. Please, please.

- [Gwen] Alice.

Alice?

- Oh, sh*t.

sh*t.

- You gotta admit, you

brought this on yourself.

- Hey, Gwen, can we

talk about all this?

Gwen?

Hello?

Gwen?

Gwen?

Gwen, what the hell.

I've been looking all

over the place for you.

What were you um...

Wh, what, what were you doing

down in the pool?

- Come over here. I'll show you.

- [Mom] Where are

you now, sweetie?

- I just passed through Denning,

but I'm thinking I

should probably stop soon

because I think I'm on

seven hours straight now.

There's a motel up ahead.

It's a popular spot.

It's a popular spot.

- [Mom] Okay.

But I want you to call me

as soon as you check in.

Oh, I miss my baby already.

- Mom, I

literally saw you yesterday.

- [Gwen] Hi there.

- [Cole] Hi.

- Admiring our pool I see.

- [Cole] Yeah.

- Certainly is one of our

most impressive features.

The guests just love it.

- I bet. It's a... it's dope.

- You won't believe this,

but last year we had a giant

sinkhole at the bottom.

- For real?

- Sucked the water right out.

I mean, the hole was so big,

you could fit five people

down there.

- No way.

- Come on, let me check you in.

- Yeah.

- Sign here.

Have you traveled far?

- No, just out of state.

Yeah, heading down to Ashford

for college, actually.

You ever been to Ashford?

- Can't say that I have.

Now,

let me...

put you in...

...cabin eight.

Oh, it's my favorite.

- Sounds great.

Are you okay?

- Never better.

Let me show you to your room.
