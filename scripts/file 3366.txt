(rumbling)

(anxious, pulsating music)

- Okay, remember

what we talked about?

Use the product rule

to find the derivative.

- I can't do this.

(child giggling)

- Hey, Corinne, not now.

Yeah, you can, Simon.

I've seen your scratch work.

Just take your time.

Focus on the equation.

- Okay, I can't learn

this by tomorrow.

I'm totally fried.

Can't you just give 'em to me?

- Simon.

- Please.

(soft, suspenseful music)

Thanks.

- You can't tell

anyone about this.

As soon as the test

is over, destroy it.

You're lucky, that

was my last one.

- Don't you need it?

- No.

Hello?

- Laina, this is Dr. Perkash,

your mother is asking to be

discharged from the hospital.

- What?

- [Dr. Perkash] She's

not so much asking

as signing herself out of care

against our advice.

- I'll be right there.

Just please try to stall her.

Okay, guys, time to go.

(elevator dings)

- Hi, there they are.

This is perfect.

Can you take that to

the car for mommy?

- [Laina] Mom,

what are you doing?

- I am checking out.

You know what, sweetheart,

I left your markers in my room.

Wanna go to mommy's room

and go get your markers?

- Is mommy coming home?

- Yes, I am.

- Mom, you need to be here,

they can't treat you at home.

- I know.

- [Doctor] Laina,

can I have a word?

- Here, I know

it's not all of it,

but I can get more.

- Oh, um, no, we're past that.

Her white blood cell count is

not doing her any favors.

And this kind of

aggressive depletion

doesn't give us

a lot of options.

- But she can't

come home, right?

She's not gonna get

any better there.

- I think the best thing

any one can do now

is to just keep her comfortable.

I'm sorry.

(mother laughing)

- [Mother] Can you help

me carry my suitcase?

- [Child] Uh huh.

- Hey, I'm gonna make

a run to the kitchen,

want anything?

- No, I'm good Blake,

thanks for asking.

You go ahead.

- All right, thanks man.

- All right.

(anxious, pulsating music)

(growling yell)

(laughing)

- Oh my.

- I honestly think I've done

that to you like 19 times.

- Yeah, well, that's

the last time..

I didn't mean it like that.

- I just, I don't

want to talk about it.

- Ellie, no matter

what happens, I'll...

- I didn't come here

to talk about the test.

Come on, I wanna

show you something.

- Okay.

(car revving)

- [Ellie] Sh! It's a secret.

- [Blake] Come on, Ellie.

(Ellie shushing)

Oh my god.

Ellie we shouldn't

be doing this.

- Calm down.

Live a little.

(Ellie laughing)

- Ellie, did you bring

your bathing suit?

- No. (Laughs)

(both laughing)

Go on.

(water splashing)

(kissing)

- What's wrong?

- I'm scared, Blake.

- Hey, we're in this together.

I'll take care of you.

- Hey, Blake.

You know, I think I do want

something from the kitchen.

I found him at

the Bilski's pool.

- Bilskis?

You want a Pop-Tart?

- No thanks.

- Some people like

to toast these.

But I never have the

patience, you know.

Love 'em.

Did you have fun tonight?

You got anything

going on tomorrow?

Oh wait, my god,

you have a test.

It's test day tomorrow.

I completely forgot myself,

it's so easy to forget

something like that, isn't it?

- I get it.

Hey, sorry.

- Look, there's nothing wrong

with having a little fun

every once in a while,

but you gotta pick your moments.

The night before a

life altering test

it's not the moment.

- Got it.

Solid lecture.

- Almost done.

Now, I know that you

don't really care

what I think about this girl.

- Ellie.

- Ellie, but she's

a distraction.

Now you have tomorrow,

and next year.

And after that you have

the whole rest of your

life to be distracted.

Don't eff it up.

You sure you don't

want a Pop-Tart?

- Good night, Dad.

- Hey... come here.

(soft suspenseful music)

- No, no, no.

No!

- [Masked Man] Move along.

- [Simon] Sh*t!

- Hey, Lana, right?

- Yeah, Laina.

- Laina.

- It's cool.

- Sorry, um.

This is kind of an

awkward question.

I was hoping that I could

buy one of your study guides?

- I can't.

- What do you mean I can't.

- I just gave the last one away.

- Sh*t.

- Hey Laina, wait up.

So, you and Blake Renning, huh?

- No, not really.

He didn't even know my name.

- He didn't know your name?

But we've been in school

with him since first grade

and there's less and

less kids each year.

- I know, it's pretty tragic.

- Geez, well, it's

almost as tragic

as being in love

with your best friend

who's in love with the guy that

doesn't even know her name.

But that's just something

I saw in a movie once.

- [Laina] Not today, Kellan.

- Yeah, you're right,

tomorrow's actually

better for me anyway.

(digital scanning)

- [Voiceover] No laptops,

computer devices.

- [Masked Man] Hey, what the.

(intense percussion music)

Get back here.

All units converse

at the south gate.

We got a runner.

Get that kid.

Heading your way, now.

- Whoa, I've never seen a kid

make it past the guards before.

- Kellan.

Are you hacking into

your dad's account again?

- Uh, yeah.

(vehicle revving)

(intense percussion music)

- [Voiceover] Bring him down.

You're surrounded.

Move in.

Come up now, on him.

Move in, boys.

- [Laina] So you're

going to send

the stolen security

footage to the news?

- You ever heard of Wendy Banks?

- No.

- Well, she's a very prominent

news reporter in Austin

and I have her direct, personal,

general inquiries email address,

so I'm sending her hot tips

(snapping) all the time.

- Does she ever reply?

- Whoa, I think I have

more than enough questions

to answer today,

thank you, very much.

(whimpering)

- You're gonna be okay, okay?

You can do this, yeah?

(electronic pinging)

- [Voiceover] Commence

lock down sequence.

- [Voiceover] Yes sir.

- [Voiceover] Warning, lock

down is now in progress.

30 seconds 'til lock down.

Testing to begin in 15 minutes.

(metallic screeching

and thudding)

- Good morning, everyone.

I hope you all had

a good night sleep.

I just want you to know

that you've all

had a great year,

and despite what happens today,

I am proud of each

and every one of you.

These questions are tough,

but they are not

aimed to trick you.

So, focus, take your time.

And no matter how

hard something looks,

there's always a chance.

- You'll have two hours

to complete the test.

No talking.

Keep your eyes on

your own tablet.

This time is an accurate test

that will determine

your aptitude.

As you know, all

grades are final.

Pick up your tablets and begin.

(dramatic music)

(digital pinging)

- You have one minute remaining.

- Time's up, tablets

down, test is over.

(sniffling)

(typing)

- Okay, here are the results.

- Donald Green.

- [Voiceover] Come with me.

- Kellie Jeffries.

- [Voiceover] This way.

- Marcus Langley.

- Don't touch me.

- [Voiceover] Come on.

- Don't touch me.

- [Voiceover] Hands out.

- Touch me.

- [Female Teacher] Lane Vic.

- No, no, no, no,

no, no, no, no, no!

- [Voiceover] He's on the

move, he's on the move.

- [Voiceover] Hey,get him, back row.

Give him the door.

(grunting)

(thwacking)

- Carrie Billich.

(sobbing)

- [Voiceover] Come on,

it's time to go.

- [Carrie] Please stop, please.

- And finally.

- Peter Strand.

- Ellie Harper.

- [Blake] No, no!

- Congratulations,

you've all passed.

(sniffling)

You can go to the rec room now.

- [Voiceover] Governor,

Blake's on the phone.

- Oh, good.

- Blake, I just heard the

good news, congratulations.

- Dad, they took Ellie,

she's going to the thinning.

- Oh god.

I'm sorry son.

- We have to do something, Dad.

Just make a phone call,

you can say it was a mistake.

- [Governor] You

know I can't do that.

- [Blake] Dad.

- Son, we all have

to obey the law.

No matter how painful it is.

- I can't lose her, Dad,

I love her.

- I'm sorry, son,

my hands are tied.

(locker slamming)

- [Voiceover] Stay in the line.

Keep going.

Single file.

You, this way.

(anxious, pulsating music)

(grunting)

- [Voiceover] What

are you doing?

Get back in line.

Put that down.

(grunting)

- Run, Ellie!

Go, now!

- [Voiceover] She

went down the hall.

- Help, help, no,

no, no, please, no!

No!

- [Voiceover] There's

nothing to see.

- No!

- Come on, hurry up, this way.

- No, no, no!

Let her go!

Let her go!

No, let her go!

- Blake!

- Ellie! Ellie! Ellie!

- Hey Wade, come on in, boy.

(laughing and clapping)

(sighing)

- Mr. Glass?

Do you have a minute?

(doorbell ringing)

- Corinne, watch your brother.

- Hi.

- I know you told me to stop,

but I made way too much of

this casserole, so please.

- Joey, turn it off.

Corinne has to study.

- I'm sorry, thank you so much.

- Listen, do you have someone

to watch Joey tomorrow?

Because I know of

a great day care.

- The Consores said they'd

watch him, thank you.

- [Teacher] I know it's

Corinne's first test.

- We're going to be fine.

- You know I'm here

if you need me.

I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

(jump rope smacking floor)

(panting)

(exhaling)

- So, as far as tomorrow?

- I wouldn't worry

about a thing.

- If you're watching this video,

then I am no longer alive.

- How many sides

does a pentagon have?

- Five.

- What causes disease?

- Bacteria.

- How many letters

are in the alphabet?

- 26.

- Who loves you?

- (Laughs) You do.

- You're going to do great.

I love you so much.

- I love you, too.

(dramatic music)

- Hey, you ready to go?

- [Corinne] Uh huh.

- Name, please?

- Corinne Michaels.

- Okay, thanks.

Good luck, Corinne.

- [Guard] Name, please?

(dramatic music)

- You have a sit down with

Greet the Press at 1pm

directly after the announcement.

- Great, what about the speech?

- We got the revisions

this morning,

they're good.

- Did Georgina sign off?

- Yes, sir.

You're car will be

ready for you at 11.

- Hey, knock knock.

- What do you want,

I'm running late.

- Not everything I do

has a grand intention.

I just wanted to say hey.

- Hey.

- Blake.

I wish there was something

I could have done.

But none of us

are above the law.

Not me, not you, not Ellie.

- That's a good line.

You should use it in

your speech today.

Is there anything else

you want to try out?

(dramatic music)

- [Voiceover] Hey.

- Hey.

- I can't believe

this is the last one.

I don't know why I'm

telling you this right now

but I'm sweating so much

that my backpack is just wet.

- [Laina] That's gross.

- I know you don't stress

out about this stuff

because you're a

genius or whatever,

but, you gotta be a

little bit relieved.

I mean, think about it,

this is the last time

you have to worry

about grades forever.

- Not exactly.

You know you don't have

to hang out with me,

it's okay.

- Oh, really, sweet.

Did I get you?

- No, you do this everyday.

- Oh, well, do I

do this everyday?

'Ello, do I look British?

Do I look like a British person?

(smacking)

- Out of the way, b*tches.

Wade Freeman, all star

quarterback, represent!

- How the hell is

that guy still here?

- Maybe he's smart.

- Is this your phone?

Here you go.

Oh, dude,

oh here you go, I'm sorry.

Aw man, you're definitely

getting thinned.

Go fetch, b*tch.

- Closeted smart.

(beeping)

- [Voiceover] Commence

lock down sequence,

- [Voiceover] Yes sir.

(beeping)

- [Voiceover] Warning, lock

down is now in progress.

30 seconds until lock down.

Testing to begin in 15 minutes.

Warning, lock down

is now in progress.

- [Voiceover] Excuse

me, Governor Redding?

- [Announcer] Increased security

demonstrations in Moscow.

- Sir, I think you're gonna

want to take a look at this.

It's your son.

- [Voiceover] Good

morning, class.

- [Students] Good

morning, Miss Cole.

Now, before we begin,

I'm going to show you

a really special video

before you take your

first test, okay?

(twinkling music)

- [Voiceover] This is

planet Earth, our home.

See how happy she is?

Well, she wasn't

always so happy.

You see, not so long ago,

the Earth wasn't

feeling so well.

First, she got too hot.

(giggling)

then, the oceans

started to rise,

leaving less room on the

land for Earth's friends,

and with less land and

more and more people,

there was just not enough

room for everybody.

Luckily, boys and girls

from all over the world

got together and came up

with some very cool ways

to eliminate five percent of

their population annually.

(heavy breathing and sniffling)

- You okay, Miss Cole?

Everything all right?

Because if you

are not up for it,

we can have someone

else come down here.

- No, I'm fine.

Just need a minute.

- [Voiceover] Some places

say goodbye to their oldest.

Others only let mommies

and daddies have one baby.

In America, what if only

the smartest boys and girls

got to live here?

That way, there's

enough to go around.

And America could be

the best country again.

Isn't that neat?

Now, all kids from 1st

grade til 12th grade

get to take the 10-241 test to

help planet Earth feel great.

(clapping)

- 'Kay, now, it's

time for everyone

to pick up your tablets, okay?

You have a very exciting test

today, just like we practiced.

- These questions are hard,

but if you take your time,

and focus,

remember there's

always a chance.

Okay, pick up your

tablets and begin.

Good luck.

- If you're watching this video,

then I am no longer alive.

Today, I will be filling

in enough incorrect answers

to definitely fail

my 10-241 examine.

My dad wants to

stand by this system.

He's gonna have to

stand by a system

that put his own son to death.

- I want him home now.

- Sir, we can't...

- I want my son home now!

- Testing's already begun,

the school's on

complete lock down.

- [Governor] God

damnit, god damnit!

(chair breaking)

- Sir, they're ready for you.

- Take a walk.

(beeping)

(electronic pinging)

- This is Mason King.

(dramatic music)

(electronic pinging)

- Yes, Nathan.

- I don't know this one.

Can you help me?

- Sorry, I can't.

Just do your best, okay?

- Okay.

(dramatic music)

(electronic pinging)(dinging)

- Time's up, tablets down,

test is over.

(electronic pinging)

(dramatic music)

(typing and electronic pinging)

- If I call your name,

I want you to stand up

and follow the leader.

We're gonna play a song

while we grade the test.

("My Country, 'Tis of Thee")

My country 'tis of thee

Sweet land of liberty

- Kevin Barrow.

Of thee I see.

Land where my fathers died

Land of the pilgrims' pride

- Nicole Chung.

Of every mountainside

- No, no!

Let freedom ring

- [Voiceover] Marissa Gomez.

- [Marissa] Get off me.

My native country, thee

- Nathan Hill.

Land of the noble free

Thy name I love

I love thy rocks and rills

Thy woods and templed hills

- Mark Salazar.

- [Voiceover] Come with me.

Like that above

- Sarah Foster.

- No, no, no!

No, no, please no, don't, no!

- Congratulations, the

rest of you passed.

- And lastly.

- Laina Michaels.

(anxious, pulsating music)

- What?

- [Voiceover] Come on,

it's time to go.

(heavy breathing)

- [Teacher] Class dismissed.

(anxious, pulsating music)

- Is he safe?

- [Voiceover] The

transfer is complete.

Everything is in

order, governor.

- Mason, I appreciate

your discretion.

- [Mason] As always, I

need the word from you

to make it official.

Are we approved to

commence the thinning.

- You are approved.

- [Voiceover] Yes, sir.

- Good.

- Good, are you ready?

- Time to sell the dream.

(clapping and applause)

(electronic pinging)

- Officer, wait,

I'm Kendra Birch,

I'm Laina's teacher.

Laina's the best

student I've ever had.

I'm finding it very

difficult to believe

that she failed the exam.

Maybe there was a

problem with her tablet?

Do something, please?

Make it right.

(beeping)

- [Officer] Chang, there's a

teacher in the west corridor

who thinks there's a mistake

with a student's test.

Please advise.

- [Voiceover] What's

the name of the student?

- Michaels, Laina Michaels.

- [Officer] Look up, Michaels.

First name, Laina.

- [Voiceover] There's

no mistake, proceed,

and don't hold up

the line again.

- No, I can't.

(shushing)

- There's always a chance.

Get the hell out of here.

- [Voiceover]

Let's go, move out.

(fast-paced electronica music)

- Hey, congratulations,

you made it!

Frank Halloran, EG Electric.

Aren't you Governor

Redding's son?

I'd like to talk to

you about your future.

Hey, Clare!

(fast-paced electronica music)

- Come on.

Thata boy.

Thata boy, Kellan.

(uptempo rock music)

(applause)

- When my grandfather

started at Server Global,

he only worked with

people he could trust.

And I can tell you, today,

that he would trust no

one more than my friend

and the leader of the

great state of Texas,

Governor Dean Redding!

(applause and cheering)

- Thank you, Georgina.

Thank you.

Thank you, thank you.

What a great day in Texas!

(cheering)

Being governor of this great

state for the past six years,

we've accomplished some

pretty incredible things.

We balanced the budget.

We even had a little bit

of change left to spare.

(cheering)

We cracked down on crime by 26%,

and above all,

we are number one in education

in the entire United

States of America.

(cheering and applause)

- [Voiceover] Move

down the line.

Move down the line.

- [Governor] Our

world is crowded.

We had to look facts

square in the eye.

- You must be really proud.

- [Governor] And make some

hard decisions.

We had to collectively decide,

what kind of world do

we want to live in?

25 years ago, America

was in trouble.

(intense, suspenseful music)

- [Voiceover] Prepare

for decontamination.

Remove all clothing.

- There are those that say

the thinning is barbaric.

Well, I ask you, is it barbaric

to be leading in innovation?

(cheering and applause)

Is it barbaric to

be the number one

most informed and

educated population

in 196 countries?

(mixed cheering and booing)

Is it barbaric to be the best?

(booing)

If you don't work,

if you don't support

our great society,

then you are living

off the system.

That is a parasite.

And do you know what

we do with parasites?

We wash them out.

(intense, dramatic music)

Today's average student

is yesterday's valedictorian.

Tell that to Vermont.

Tell that to Oregon.

(cheering)

We introduced competition

in the classroom

and the results

speak for themselves.

(cheering and applause)

- [Voiceover] Put these on now.

- Our great country

has many challenges still ahead.

And with your help,

we can take the good

things we've done in Texas

and lead the rest of America

into an even greater tomorrow.

(applause)

(grunting)

- [Blake] Sir, please, help me.

- [Officer] You know, you

shouldn't be in the hallway.

(grunting)

(thudding)

(dramatic music)

(smacking)

(grunting)

(intense, dramatic music)

(upbeat rock music)

(typing)

(electronic pinging)

(suspenseful music)

(upbeat rock music)

(beeping)

- This hour,

this minute,

this moment.

(typing)

(clanking)

(heavy breathing)

I have looked inside myself

and in front of the people

of the great state of Texas.

(buzzing)

(crying)

- [Woman] No, no!

- I came here to

declare my candidacy

for president of the

United States of America.

(applause and cheering)

(grunting)

(buzzing)

(music stops)

(buzzing)

(buzzing)

(buzzing)

- [Voiceover] Stay in your seat.

(grunting)

- [Voiceover] Hey,

back to the chair.

- [Voiceover] Remain seated.

- [Voiceover] Sit down!

No!

(thudding and grunting)

Get down!

- [Voiceover] Hey you, sit down!

Now!

- [Voiceover] Get

them in control!

(anxious, pulsating music)

(grunting)

(electronic pinging)

(hitting keys on keyboard)

- System is down,

commence containment mode.

Send Victor Woods directly

to the control room.

We need a full patch of

the electrical system.

- [Voiceover] Copy that.

(gasping)

(murmuring)

- [Voiceover] Victor Woods,

report to the control room.

- [Voiceover] Everybody

stand back, stand back.

- Uh, Victor Woods, thanks.

- [Voiceover] We've had

a minor power outage.

Nobody leave this room

until further notice.

(thudding and clanking)

(door shutting)

- What are they doing

out of the chairs?

- [Voiceover] Some of

the restraints shorted

during the power outage.

But we got it under control.

- Have you done a head count?

- [Officer] Sir,

the door's locked.

There's no way they could have.

- This isn't a discussion.

When's the power back?

Power's about 30 away.

The cameras are gonna

need a separate patch.

- Just get it done.

(electronic pinging)

- [Voiceover] Hey!

What are you doing down here?

- It's about time.

I called for you 10 minutes ago.

- [Voiceover] What?

- I'm Miss Birch.

I teach 10th to 12th grade.

- [Voiceover] Wait,

why are you wearing...

- I just saw a student

go down that stairwell.

(grunting)

(thudding)

(electronic powering up)

(locker clanking)

(grunting and thudding)

(grunting and thudding)

(electronic pinging

and murmuring)

- What's the count?

- [Officer] There's

one unaccounted for.- You lost a student.

- [Officer] I don't

know how she got out.

- She?

- [Officer] Her name

is Laina Michaels.

- And where is she?

(heavy breathing)

- Blake?

- Lauren?

You failed the test?

- It's Laina, and no.

There's no way I

failed that test.

What are you doing here?

Didn't you pass?

- I failed the test on purpose.

- You did what?

- I put my dad between

a rock and a hard place

and he moved the rock.

- Something's not right.

- Come on, I think

I know where to go.

(soft, undulating music)

(clanking)

(siren blaring)

- [Voiceover] Level four

breach, level four breach.

Level four breach.

- Come on.

- [Voiceover] Level

four breach.

Level four breach.

- [Voiceover] Hey, hey, come on.

Stay back.

- [Voiceover] Hey, what

the hell's going on?

- [Voiceover] Everybody

stay where you are.

This will all be over soon.

- [Voiceover] Sir,

it's past noon.

- We're still in lock

down until this is done.

No one comes in or out.

- [Voiceover] Parents

are already asking

when they'll see their children.

- What's the status on

the missing student?

- [Voiceover] All

clear on level four.

- I want every teacher

brought to holding

room A immediately.

- [Voiceover] Yes, sir.

(suspenseful tones)

- Okay.

Where do you want to go?

- We need to find where

they keep the tests.

- What are you gonna do?

Steal the answers for next year?

- Excuse me?

- You know, for your

little side business.

Where you sell the answers

to desperate kids for money.

- You don't know what

you're talking about.

- No, I do.

Innocent kids are killed

to meet a bottom line.

And you found a way

to profit off them.

Tell me, Laina,

what did you spend

the money on first?

Was it a car?

A nice dress, maybe?

- My mom.

We had to figure out a way

to pay for the treatments.

We sold everything

we could, but,

it still wasn't enough.

I'm not proud of what I did.

I just didn't know

what else to do.

In the end it

didn't even matter.

You know, it's funny,

every day in school they teach

us how to solve problems.

But none of those answers

are on the real world.

- I'm such a dick.

I'm sorry.

- It's okay.

Thank you for admitting

you're a dick.

I'm sorry, too.

I just always liked you

and I guess I was kind

of jealous of Ellie.

- You like me?

- Liked, past tense.

Now, can you help me?

- Um, yeah, I can get

us to the control room

but with the power out

there's not much we can do.

- Right.

Excuse me.

- [Blake] Sorry.

- [Laina] We can follow

the network cables,

which will lead

to the server room

which runs on reserve power.

- Yeah, but don't

all computers require

administrator access...

- [Laina] Access card?

Come on.

- Yeah, we're doing it.

- I'm great, I'm glad we

could finally get this

on the calendar.

- As am I.

- [Voiceover] 10

seconds, 10 seconds.

- Got it, thank you.

(suspenseful music)

(door sliding open)

- Key cards and I.D.s

(dramatic music)

- Thank you for

joining us, governor.

- Thank you for

having me here, Vince,

it's a pleasure to be here.

- Governor, I apologize.

We're getting breaking

news right now.

There is a story developing

at Vista Point High School,

right here in Austin.

We're getting word that the

school is still under lock down.

Now, the test should

have ended hours ago.

Parents are growing concerned

as the school is said to be

holding students indefinitely

with no word as to whether or

not their children are safe.

Now, governor,

what do say to these

concerned voters?

- Well, while, I don't

have any immediate details

on the incident,

I can say that we do have

the best team in

the nation on site

and that any problems or confusion

will be resolved shortly.

Somebody tell me what the hell

is going on at that school.

(electronic pinging)

- It's worse than we thought.

- Show me.

- Parents have been

waiting for over two hours

with little to no information

on what has happened

to their children

at Vista Point High.

- We don't know if our son

passed the test or

failed or anything.

This day is hard

enough for all of us

and we deserve answers.

This community has

been through enough.

- No parents of

students at Vista Point

have been notified as of yet.

We'll keep you updated

as this bizarre story.

- Get King on the

emergency line.

(intense tones)

- Key card and I.D.

(electronic pinging)

- This is Mason King.

(metallic crashing)

(yelping)

(water splashing)

(deep breathing)

(water splashing)

(dramatic, pulsating music)

- I'm about to have a thousand

royally pissed off parents

talking to news vans in front

of a school with no power.

I need you to explain to me

how this is even

remotely handled.

- The cables are

nearly patched through.

We'll have power back shortly.

- As soon as the power is on,

the thinning continues,

you understand?

The eyes of the

nation are on us.

We have zero room for failure.

- Understood, sir.

We'll find her.

- We'll find her.

Find who?

(panting)

- Blake!

Blake!

Blake, breathe.

Blake, breathe!

(panting)

(coughing water)

- So that happened.

- Go put these on.

So, am I going to

have to ask you

or are you going

to be a gentleman?

- I'll be a gentleman.

Do I need to ask

you to be a lady?

- Sorry.

- It's all good.

I got like a three quick

peeks, so we're even.

- Okay, are you decent?

- No, but I am wearing clothes.

(laughing)

So I guess we're gonna

have to figure out a way

to get back up there, somehow.

- You do that, I'm going

to go through here.

- What the hell is this?

- We passed the test,

this is bullshit.

- I want to go home.

- No one has told us anything.

Are we just supposed to

sit here, indefinitely?

- [Voiceover] Nobody

leaves this room

until we get the all clear.

- Don't tell me what to do.

Do you have any idea

who my parents are?

I'm leaving.

- [Voiceover] Stay back!

(thudding)

(crowd gasping)

(thudding)

(anxious, pulsating music)

(clanking)

(clanking)

- Sh*t.

(intense, suspenseful tones)

- We can't go down there.

There's too many of them.

- We need that card.

I don't think we can get

to the computer without it.

- Okay, well, there's

got to be another way.

Where are you going?

(soft, pulsating music)

- [Laina] This is the one.

- [Blake] All right.

You ready?

(clanking)

(draws closing and opening)

(anxious, pulsating music)

- Perfect.

(door thudding)

Blake, hurry.

(door opening)

- Go, go, go.

(anxious, pulsating music)

(electronic powering up)

(anxious, pulsating music)

- Blake?

- [Blake] You take care of that.

I'm going to the thinning.

- Okay, the major

networks should be here

within the hour.

I still don't understand

what you'll say.

- The press are

like sharks, Ted.

They smell blood,

they'll come swimming.

We just need to give

them some fresh meat.

(door shutting)

- [Voiceover] We found

him beat up pretty bad.

- You got beat up by a girl.

- No, sir, well, yes sir.

It was two of them.- Two girls?

- No, it was a male student.

They got the jump on me.

The other said

she was a teacher.

- What was the teacher's name?

- This is ridiculous.

- Yes, this whole thing is.

- I don't know about you,

but I could use a

drink after this.

- Me too.

You want to join

me for one later?

- Sure.

- Good.

- I have to warn you,

I get a little

handsy when I drink.

(laughing)

- I can deal with handsy.

- So I'll see you after school?

- I'll see you then.

- 'Kay.

(soft inquiring music)

(electronic pinging)

- Sh*t.

Kellan.

(typing)

Come on.

- Miss Birch, right?

Let's continue

where we left off.

Key card and I.D.

Very well.

Key card and I.D.

- I must have dropped it.

- No, I don't think so.

- Excuse me, this is a mistake.

- Everybody out.

- I had it two seconds ago.

- Where is she?

- Who?

(punching)

(panting)

I don't know who

you're talking about.

(punching)

(thudding and panting)

I'm broke.

- This is the last time

that I'll ask nicely.

(electronic powering up)

Where's Laina?

(electronic powering up)

(whimpering)

(anxious, pulsating music)

- Oh my god, Laina.

(anxious, pulsating music)

(laughs)

(electronic pinging)

(typing)

(electronic pinging)

(encouraging instrumental music)

(intense, pulsating music)

- All the information

we have as of now

is this morning,

approximately 11:45am,

Laina Michaels, a student

at Vista Point High,

failed an exam.

She then proceeded to

attack several DPC officers,

injuring two and tragically

killing two others.

Since then, the

students have been moved

to a safe place and

are being protected

under the watchful

eye of our teachers

until Miss Michaels

can be apprehended.

- Corinne, do you

need a ride home?

- [Governor] I would like

to speak to you as a father.

- Come on.

- I understand your pain.

My son is in that

school as well.

And I will do

everything in my power

to bring him and

everyone else home safe.

Blake, if you're watching,

I love you son.

This is a trying

time for all of us.

I ask for your patience

and understanding

as we move to

resolve this matter

and bring Miss

Michaels to justice.

- Wendy, you need to see this.

- This was taken from

inside the high school.

- Yeah, that's

definitely a DPC guard

hitting a passing student.

- This doesn't add up.

Who's the source on this?

(anxious, pulsating music)

This footage was sent to

us by a student source

inside Vista Point High.

- Kellan?

(electronic pinging)

(anxious, pulsating music)

- Hello.

All units converge

to the server room.

We have her.

(intense, percussion music)

(door opening)

- [Blake] Attention.

I was just told to

move these students

to the recreation

hall immediately.

- [Officer] I didn't hear that.

The students are staying until

Mason King says otherwise.

- [Blake] I was just

told to take everyone

to the recreation hall

without any hold ups.

So, let's get moving.

Undo the restraints.

(relieved whimpering)

- [Officer] No, we

do don't do anything

without direct confirmation

from Mason King.

Identify yourself now.

- Of course.

I'm sorry, let me show

you the confirmation.

(thudding)

- [Voiceover] He's not a guard!

(thudding and grunting)

(anxious, pulsating music)

- I have proof.

I passed that test.

- Congratulations.

(electronic powering up)

Take her to the thinning.

- Holy sh*t.

(anxious, pulsating music)

(thudding)

- [Voiceover]

Good, get him down.

Get his mask.

(yelping)

- I don't care where you

pull the graphics from,

we're going live now.

- [Voiceover] Wendy,

this hasn't been approved

by the network.

- Karl, it's called

breaking news for a reason.

We're going with this, now.

Three, two.

(suspenseful percussion music)

- No, no, not Laina.

- Less than an hour ago,

Governor Redding

announced a situation

inside Vista Point High

involving a dangerous failed

student, Laina Michaels,

said to be wreaking

havoc on campus

leaving behind her

a trail of terror.

Just moments ago, we received

official documentation

from inside the high school

revealing falsified test scores,

possibly to favor or

target specific students

to evade or endure the thinning.

Among those wrongfully

accused of failing the exam,

Laina Michaels, received

one of the highest scores

in the school.

Blake Redding, son of

governor Dean Redding

passed the exam, despite

having the lowest score

at Vista Point High.

(phone ringing)

- Hi.

- I thought you

said that you had

the situation under control.

- Well, the

situation's changing.

- Yes it has.

I'm starting to think I

backed the wrong horse.

Congressman Sandoval

doesn't come

with these kinds of problems.

- Georgina.

- Don't Georgina me.

Fix it or you won't

have enough money

to run for city comptroller.

- [Voiceover] This explosive

development calls everything

said today by the governor's

office into question

and reveals a larger

scandal at play.

- This is bad.

This is bad.

You got to shut it down.

Dean, it's over, you

got to let the girl go.

You need to shut

this down, right now.

Goddammit, Dean, are

you listening to me?

It's over.

There's no more moves.

- There's one more move.

- No, please.

No, no!

(intense music)

- Sir, everything is in order.

As always, I need the word

from you to make it official.

Are we approved to

commence the thinning?

Sir, are we approved to

commence the thinning?

- No.

There's been a change.

We need to revise the list.

- Sir?

- [Governor] That's an order.

(typing)

(electronic release)

- All released students

are free to proceed to

the recreation hall.

Congratulations, you've passed.

(whimpering)

Round them up.

- [Laina] What's going on?

- [Officer] Let's go.

- Blake.

Blake what's happening?

- It's okay.

- [Laina] No, what's going on?

- [Blake] It's okay, I did this.

- Get her out of here.

- Blake, no!

- Get her out of here!

- [Laina] Put me down, no!

- [Voiceover] Out of the way.

Wade Freeman, time to go.

- Get off me, bro.

Bro, that's my

throwing arm, bro.

Do you know who I am?

Wade Freeman, you b*tch.

(anxious, pulsating music)

(drilling tones)

(soft, somber music)

- It's all over.

The school-wide lock

down has been lifted

and passing students

have been reunited

with their loved ones

after what has been

a long, trying day,

here in Austin.

As always, our hearts

go out to the families

of the failing students

who scored in the

lowest percentile.

The head of the DPC, Mason King,

has been taken in

for questioning

in connection with the

altered test scores.

- I am appalled by the alleged

criminal action of Mr. King.

As of tomorrow morning,

I am appointing a

special committee

to fully investigate what

really happened at Vista Point.

If Mr. King is guilty,

he will dearly pay for

his unlawful actions.

- Earlier reports indicating

a scandal involving

Governor Redding

falsifying test information

were discredited when the

presidential hopeful revealed his son Blake was among this

year's failing students.

- My son, as much as I love him,

is no different than any

of your sons or daughters.

I'm not a hypocrite.

The laws apply to all of us.

It just doesn't

make it any easier.

I lost my son today.

But I know in my heart

that he died for a purpose.

All of our fallen students have

made the ultimate sacrifice

in the name of ensuring

a better tomorrow

and in keeping

America's future bright.

I'd like to take a moment and

thank them for their courage.

(car revving)

- [Voiceover] Hold it.

Okay, they're all clear.

(buzzing)

(gate screeching)

(anxious, pulsating music)

("DNA")

Dark as midnight

Six pack Coors Light

You don't look the same

Past my bedtime

Blue and red lights

Come take you away

Hate to see you like a monster

So I run and hide

Hate to ask but what's it like

To leave me behind

I won't be, no I

won't be like you

Fighting back, I'm

fighting back the truth

Eyes like yours

can't look away

But you can't stop DNA

No, you can't stop DNA

Twice a year, you

come in crashing

Nice to see you too

Johnny Cash and

backseat laughing

Always ends too soon

Hate to say hello 'cause

I know that it means goodbye

Hate to ask but what's

it like to leave me behind

I won't be, no I

won't be like you

Fighting back, I'm

fighting back the truth

Eyes like yours

can't look away

But you can't stop DNA

No, you can't stop DNA

All the pieces of you

And the pieces of me

I'm just so scared

You're who I'll

be when I erupt

Just like you

do, they look at me

I can't look at you
