FADE IN ON:
that most persistent summer SOUND: crickets in high grass--
ree-ree-ree-ree... This in dark which slowly
DISSOLVES TO:
EXT. A GRAVE MARKER SUMMER DAY
It's a plywood cross leaning aslant. Written on the crossarm in
black paint which has faded: SMUCKY HE WAS OBEDIENT. The letters
are faded. They are also straggling and ill-formed--the work of a
child.
MAIN TITLES BEGIN.
EXT. ANOTHER GRAVE MARKER
A child's printing again, this time on a chunk of warped crating:
BIFFER BIFFER A HELLUVA SNIFFER UNTIL HE DIED HE MADE US RICHER
1971-1974.
MAIN TITLES CONTINUE
EXT. TWO MARKERS
I think all these shots are LAP DISSOLVES. All is silence but for
the crickets and the wind stirring the grass. Around the markers
themselves, the grass has been clipped short, and by some markers
there are flowers in cheap vases. Crisco cans, Skippy peanut
butter jars, etc.
These two markers: IN MEMORY OF MARTA OUR PET RABIT DYED MARCH 1,
1965 (on a wide flat board) and GEN PATTON (OUR! GOOD! DOG!) APRIL
1958 (another board).
MAIN TITLES CONTINUE
EXT. FIVE OR SIX MARKERS
We can't read all of them; some are too faded (or the
"gravestones" themselves too degenerated), but we can see now that
this woodland clearing's a rather eerie -- and well-populated --
animal graveyard.
We can see:
LIVED. HANNAH'S tombstone is part of an old Chevrolet hood,
painstakingly hammered flat.
MAIN TITLES CONTINUE.
EXT. ANGLE ON THE PET SEMATARY
From here we can see most of the clearing, which is surrounded by
forest pines. We can see that the graves--maybe 80 in all--are
arranged in rough concentric circles. On the far side of this
clearing is the end of a path which spills into this graveyard
clearing. The end of the path is flanked by wooden poles which
hold up a crude arch. We can see no writing on this side -- the

Page 2/68

words on the arch face those arriving along the path.
MAIN TITLES CONTINUE
EXT. THE ARCH, FROM THE PATH SIDE, CU
MAIN TITLES CONCLUDE. Written on the arch in faded black paint is
the work of some long-gone child: PET SEMATARY.
THE CAMERA HOLDS ON THIS FOR A MOMENT OR TWO, THEN PANS SLOWLY
DOWN to look through the arch. From this angle we are looking
across to a deadfall--a tangle of weather-whitened old dead
branches at the back of the graveyard. It's maybe twenty-five feet
from side to side and about nine feet high. At either end are
thick tangles of underbrush that look impassible.
AS MAIN TITLES CONCLUDE, THE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN on the
deadfall. And as it does, we realize that there is a horrible
snarling face in those branches. Is this an accident? Coincidence?
Our imagination? Perhaps the audience will wonder. THE CAMERA
HOLDS ON IT and then we
DISSOLVE TO:
BLACK. And a white title card: MOVING DAY.
EXT. A HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY EVENING
SOUND of crickets: ree-ree-ree-ree...
To the left of this house: a big empty field. Behind it: the
woods. Before it: a wide two-lane road.
The house is a pleasant two-story New England dwelling with a
shed/garage attached. In front of it is a sign which reads QUINN
REALTORS 292 HAMMOND STREET, BANGOR. A big SOLD strip, like a
bumper sticker, has been plastered across it diagonally.
GROWING SOUND:
between the CAMERA and the house -- a tanker truck with a silver
body and the word ORINCO written on the side in blue letters. Its
short-stack is blowing quantities of dark brown smoke. Behind it
comes a Ford wagon, which slows, signals, and turns into the
driveway of the house we've been looking at.
EXT. REAR OF THE WAGON
As LOUIS CREED brings it to a stop we get a good look at the
license plate (Illinois) and a bumper sticker (HAVE YOU HUGGED
YOUR M.D. TODAY?)

The ENGINE SOUND stops. For a moment or two we hear only the ree-
ree-ree-ree of crickets. Then:

ELLIE CREED (voice)
Is this our new house, daddy?
LOUIS CREED (voice)
This is it.

Page 3/68

EXT. THE WAGON, A NEW ANGLE
The two front doors and one back door open. LOUIS CREED, about 32,
gets out from the driver's side. RACHEL CREED, his wife, gets out
from the passenger side. From the rear door comes ELLIE CREED, a
girl of 6. They are staring, fascinated, at the house.
They come together, the three of them, by the front of the wagon,
still staring at the house. LOUIS is clearly nervous.
LOUIS:
So...what do you think?
RACHEL begins to smile. She turns to LOUIS and hugs him.
RACHEL:
It's gorgeous!
ELLIE:
Am I really gonna have my own room?
LOUIS:
Yes.
ELLIE:
Yaay!
She looks toward the side lawn and sees a tire on a rope hanging
down from the bough of a tree.
ELLIE (to RACHEL)
Is that a swing?
RACHEL:
Yes, but the rope might be--
ELLIE:
Yaay!
She goes running toward it. RACHEL gives LOUIS a tired smile.
LOUIS:
Let her go. It's cool.
RACHEL:
Louis, the house is beautiful.
They kiss--gently at first, then more passionately. As he draws
her more tightly against him, a baby--GAGE--begins to cry from the
car. LOUIS and RACHEL break the clinch.

Page 4/68

RACHEL:
The Master of Disaster awakes.
This SOUND is joined by the unhappy yowling of a pent-up tomcat.
LOUIS:
And Buckaroo Banzai.
RACHEL:
Come on--let's parole 'em.
They walk to the car, RACHEL going to one of the back seat doors,
LOUIS to the rear of the wagon.
INT. THE FRONT SEAT, WITH RAHEL AND GAGE
GAGE is sitting in his car seat, not exactly crying but certainly
yelling to be let out. The seat, dash, and floorboards are
littered with roadmaps, soda cans, Big Mac boxes, and similar
crud. These folks have driven all the way from Chicago to Maine in
this station wagon, and the wagon looks it.
RACHEL:
Decided to wake up and see what home
looks like, huh?
She begins to unbuckle the straps and harnesses. GAGE is just
wearing a t-shirt and a diaper. He's fifteen months old.
EXT. THE REAR OF THE WAGON, WITH LOUIS
He opens the doorgate and lifts out a cat carrier. We see a big
tomcat inside--mostly what we're aware of are shining green eyes.
ELLIE (voice)
Daddy! Mommy! I see a path!
LOUIS, cat carrier still in hand, turns toward:
EXT. ELLIE IN THE TIRE SWING
She's got it penduluming back and forth in long wide arcs.
EXT. THE VIEW UP TOWARD THE WOODS, ELLIE'S POV
We see the field, and a clearly marked and mown path leading up
its flank and into the dark woods.
THE CAMERA DIPS AND PENDULUMS as ELLIE swings.
EXT. RACHEL AND GAGE (FRONT OF THE CAR)
RACHEL (irritated)
Not so high, Ellie! You don't know
how strong that rope is.
She puts GAGE down. He totters a bit on his little legs and then
stands there, looking at his sister.
EXT. THE ROPE AND THE BRANCH, CU
The bark has rubbed off the branch--it looks like a bone peeping
through decayed flesh. The rope is old, discolored. And it is

Page 5/68

fraying away as we look at it. Soon ELLIE, like Humpty Dumpty, is
going to have a great fall.
EXT. LOUIS (REAR OF THE CAR)
He's set the cat-carrier down and is straightening up.
ELLIE (raptuous voice)
Wheee!
LOUIS:
Ellie, you heard your m---
His eyes widen.
EXT. ELLIE
ELLIE:
Wh--
SOUND:
ELLIE still inside it--goes crashing to the grass. ELLIE screams
and begins to cry--a little hurt and a lot surprised.
LOUIS and RACHEL run to her.
LOUISRACHEL:
Ellie! Are you all right?Honey? Are you okay?
EXT. ELLIE, RACHEL, LOUIS, A CLOSER SHOT
ELLIE'S parents reach the tangle of tire, rope, and six-year-old
girl.
ELLIE:
Hurrts! It hurrrrts!
LOUIS:
Anyone who can scream that loud isn't
ready for intensive care just yet--
looks like she just skinned her knee.
Nevertheless, he begins to rapidly disentangle his daughter from
the tire. RACHEL helps.
EXT. GAGE
He's standing in the driveway by the front of the car, utterly
forgotten in the heat of the moment. His diaper is sagging quite a
bit; the boy needs a change.
He stares toward the scene of the accident for a bit, then loses
interest. CAMERA FOLLOWS as he walks down the side of the station
wagon, little bare feet slapping on the asphalt. He stops for a
moment at the back, looking at the cat-carrier, which LOUIS never
got around to opening. CHURCH is staring hopefully out through the

Page 6/68

mesh.
GAGE:
Hi-Durch!
CHURCH:
Waow!
GAGE bends down and tries to open the cat-carrier's door. No soap.
Either he can't solve the latch or his fingers don't have the
strength. Anyway, he stops trying after a moment.
SOUND:
EXT. THE ROAD (GAGE'S POV)
A big tanker truck--silver body, ORINCO written on the side in
blue letters--blasts by.
EXT. GAGE, BY THE CAT CARRIER
The windlash if the passing truck blows GAGE'S hair back from his
forehead. We should be scared here--not by the truck, but by
GAGE'S lack of fear. He's smiling, happy.
GAGE:
Druck!
He starts down the driveway toward the road.
EXT. LOUIS, RACHEL, ELLIE (AT THE SWING)
ELLIE has been disentangled from the swing. She's sitting by the
wreckage at the end of the driveway, weeping hysterically (as much
from tiredness as from pain, I think) as LOUIS and RACHEL examine
her scraped knee. The wound doesn't look too serious.
LOUIS (to RACHEL)
Would you get the first aid kit?
ELLIE (screaming)
Not the stingy stuff! I don't want the
stingy stuff, daddy!
RACHEL suddenly looks around toward:
EXT. THE FRONT OF THE WAGON (RACHEL'S POV)
No one there.
EXT. RACHEL, ELLIE, LOUIS, BY THE SWING
RACHEL:
Gage's gone!
LOUIS:
Jesus, the road!
They get up together.

Page 7/68

EXT. GAGE, AT THE EDGE OF THE ROAD
A truck is coming. A great big one.
EXT. ANGLE ON THE TRUCK, CU
The grille looks like a tombstone that's learned how to snarl.
EXT. GAGE
He takes a step into the road...and then big, gnarled hands grab
him.
GAGE looks rather surprised at this, but not worried--this kid is
used to being picked up and treated humanely. To GAGE strangers
are as interesting as...well, as interesting as Orinco trucks.
EXT. GAGE AND JUD CRANDALL
The fellow who has picked GAGE up is a man of about eighty in old
blue jeans, a faded Bruce Springsteen t-shirt. Over this he wears
a faded khaki vest with bright silver buttons. His face is deeply
wrinkled and kindly.
JUD CRANDALL (to GAGE)
No you don't, my friend--not in
that road.
But he softens this with a grin. GAGE grins back at him.
GAGE:
Drucks!
JUD (low)
No shit, Sherlock.
JUD carries him up the driveway to the station wagon. Here he's
joined by LOUIS and RACHEL, out of breath and really scared. ELLIE
brings up the rear. She's still sniffling.
RACHEL:
Gage!
JUD (hands him to her)
He was headed for the road, looked
like. I corralled him for you, missus.
RACHEL:
Thank you. Thank you so much.
LOUIS:
Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.
He sticks out his hand and JUD shakes it. LOUIS takes it easy--no
crushing JayCees grip, or anything like that--the old guy looks as
if he might have arthritis.
JUD:

Page 8/68

Jud Crandall. I live just across the road.
RACHEL:
I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving
the wandering minstrel boy, here.
JUD:
No harm, no foul. But you want to watch
out for that road. Those damn trucks go
back and forth all day and most of the
night.
He leans over toward ELLIE.
JUD:
Who might you be, little Miss?
ELLIE:
I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642
Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan. (Pause)
At least, I used to.
JUD:
And now you live on Route 9 in Ludlow,
and your dad's gonna be the new doctor
up to the college, I hear, and I think
you're going to be just as happy as a
clam here, Ellen Creed.
ELLIE (to LOUIS)
Are clams really happy?
They all laugh--even GAGE.
RACHEL:
Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to
change this kid. It's nice to meet you.
JUD:
Same here. Come over and visit when
you get the chance.
As RACHEL, carrying GAGE, moves away:
ELLIE (worries)
Daddy, do I really have to have the
stingy stuff?
LOUIS:

Page 9/68

No-I guess not.
ELLIE:
Yayyy!
She goes belting off.
JUD (amused)
I guess your daughter there ain't
going to die after all.
LOUIS (also amused)
I guess not.
JUD:
House has stood empty for too long.
It's damn good to see people in it again.
SOUND:
EXT. A MOVING VAN
It blinks and comes lumbering into the Creed's driveway.
EXT. LOUIS AND JUD
LOUIS:
Hey--they actually found the place!
JUD:
Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I
usually sit out on my porch of an evening
and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner.
Come on over and join me, if you want.
LOUIS:
Well, maybe I----
RACHEL (voice)
Louis, what's this?
EXT. RACHEL AND GAGE
GAGE has been changed, and RACHEL is following him as he explores
the nearest edges of the new homestead. They are fairly close to
the wreckage of the tire swing, and here is the head of the path
ELLIE has already glimpsed.
EXT. LOUIS AND JUD
They cross to the van. The FIRST and SECOND MOVERS are just
climbing out of the van.
FIRST MOVER:
You Mr. Creed?

Page 10/68

LOUIS:
Yes. Just a second.
EXT. RACHEL AND GAGE, AT THE HEAD OF THE PATH
She's holding GAGE on her hip now, and both of them are looking at
that strange (and oddly enticing) path which disappears into the
deepening twilight. LOUIS and JUD join them.
LOUIS:
The movers--
RACHEL:
Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does
it go?
LOUIS:
I don't have the slightest idea. When I saw
the house, this field was under four feet
of snow.
RACHEL (smiling)
I bet Mr. Crandall knows!
JUD nods. He smiles, too, but underneath the smile we sense that
he is serious.
JUD:
Oh, ayuh! I know. It's a good story, and
a good walk, too. I'll take you up there
sometime, and tell you the story, too--
after you get settled in.
He smiles at them and they smile back--it is a look of
understanding and real liking, in spite of the age difference
between the CREEDS and JUD.
EXT. THE CREED HOUSE NIGHT
SOUND:
There's one light upstairs, one downstairs. Perhaps we see the
path, glimmering away into the field? Either by virtue of it being
mown, or by virtue of some gentle optical trick? Maybe.
INT. THE LIVING ROOM NIGHT
There's a light on in the kitchen, but it just casts a dim glow in
here. The room has a fireplace and a lovely wooden floor. It's
going to be nice, but now it's just a big bare box with movers'
cartons stacked all over the place.
LOUIS is drinking a can of Pepsi, and he looks pretty damned

Page 11/68

tired--anyone who's ever moved house and can remember the first
night in the new place will understand.
He finishes the last of the Pepsi and surveys the living room. He
sits on one of the bigger boxes, takes cigarettes from his pocket,
and lights one. He drops the spent match in the empty can, and
taps into the can during the scene.
SOUND:
the room opens and RACHEL comes in, wearing a nightgown.
RACHEL (crossing to LOUIS)
Kids are asleep, doc.
LOUIS:
Great.
He hugs her. She hugs him back warmly--for a moment they are just
two good people in all the big darkness of their new house.
RACHEL:
You're not really going over to have a
beer with that old guy, are you?
LOUIS:
Well, I've got a million questions about
the area, and---
RACHEL:
---and you'll end up doing a free
consultation on his arthritis or urinary
problems and---
LOUIS:
Did you see his shirt?
RACHEL (giggles)
Sure. Bruce Springsteen.
LOUIS:
I really do have a million questions
about the area...but the thing I'm
really curious about is how come this
octogenarian Yankee is decorating the
slumped remains of his pecs with the
Boss.
She laughs.
EXT. THE PATH OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE NIGHT

Page 12/68

Pervasive SOUND of the crickets as LOUIS comes rather hesitantly
up the crazy-paved path from the road's edge.
JUD (voice)
That you, doc?
EXT. THE SCREENED-IN PORCH OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE
We hear the SQUEAK of a rocker; we see the dim red fitful glow of
JUD'S Pall Mall. We see by its glow that he is wearing Walkman
earphones.
EXT. LOUIS
LOUIS:
It's me.
INT. THE PORCH, WITH JUD
The Walkman is in his lap. He switches it off and puts the
headphones casually around his neck, like a kid.
JUD:
Well, come on up and have a beer.
INT. THE PORCH, A SLIGHTLY WIDER SHOT
LOUIS comes on up. JUD has got a pail of ice beside his chair with
some cans of beer in it. He opens one and hands it to LOUIS.
JUD:
You need a glass?
LOUIS:
Not at all.
JUD:
Good for you.
LOUIS drinks half the can at a draught.
LOUIS:
God, that's fine.
JUD:
Ain't it just? The man who invented
beer, Louis, that man was having a
prime day for himself.
LOUIS:
What were you listening to?
JUD:

Page 13/68

Allman Brothers.
LOUIS:
What?
JUD:
The Eat A Peach album. God, they were
good before drugs and bad luck caught
up with them. Listen to this, Louis.
He passes the headphones over. LOUIS puts them on. JUD presses the
Walkman's PLAY button.
SOUND:
LOUIS winces and rakes the spidery earphones off his head.
JUD:
I'm sorry. Wait.
He turns it down.
JUD:
Try that.
LOUIS puts the earphones back on and listens for a few moments.
It's the instrumental break. Gregg and Duane Allman dueling hot
Fenders. LOUIS takes the earphones off.
LOUIS:
Nice.
JUD:
I like rock and roll. No...I guess
that's too mild. I love it. Since
my ears started to die out on me,
it's the only music I can really hear.

And since my wife died...I dunno, some-
times a little rock and roll fills up

night. Not always, but sometimes. (Pause)
One more time--welcome to Ludlow. Hope
your time here will be a happy one.
LOUIS (great sincerity)
Thank you, Mr. Crandall.
He drinks again--they both do. There's a moment of companionable
silence here, broken by the SOUND of a big truck. They look
toward:

Page 14/68

EXT/INT. THE ROAD (THROUGH THE PORCH SCREEN)
One of those big tanker trucks goes rumbling by--now there are
little amber running lights on top of it. It's going fast, too--
sweeps by in a blast of air.
INT. THE PORCH, WITH LOUIS AND JUD
LOUIS (wincing)
Jesus!
JUD (lights a cigarette)
That's one mean road, all right--you
remember that path your wife commented on?
LOUIS:
The one that goes into the woods--sure.
JUD:
That road--and those Orinco trucks--
are the two main reasons it's there.
LOUIS:
What's at the end of it?
JUD (smiles)
Another day--after you get settled in a
bit. Meantime, doc---
Here JUD raises his glass in a toast.
JUD (continues)
Here's to your bones.
LOUIS clinks his glass against JUD'S.
LOUIS:
And yours.
They drink.
EXT. ROUTE 9 NIGHT
LOUIS crosses from the CRANDALL side to his own, and the CAMERA
FOLLOWS as he walks slowly up the driveway and past the wagon. He
pauses for a moment, looking thoughtfully--hopefully--at his new
house. Then something--the CRY of an OWL, perhaps--draws his
attention the other way...toward the path.
He walks to its head and stands looking out at it--it glimmers in
a wide cut swath that's a bit ghostly in the dark.
A SHAPE suddenly lurches out of the high grass at him, and LOUIS
recoils with a startled, muffled cry.
EXT. CHURCH
The cat, sure; who--or what--else? We see his big green eyes in
the dark as he cries his strange feline hello: Waow!

Page 15/68

EXT. LOUIS AND CHURCH, AT THE HEAD OF THE PATH
LOUIS:
Church! God, you scared the life
out of me!
CHURCH:
Waow!
LOUIS bends and picks up the cat. As he does, that truck SOUND
comes again and he looks toward:
EXT. THE ROAD, LOUIS'S POV
Another Orinco tanker drones by, fast.
EXT. LOUIS AND CHURCH
LOUIS (to the cat)
I know one thing that will keep you
home, good buddy.
He starts toward the house.
BLACK. And in that blackness, we see a second title card: THE DEAD
SPEAK.
INT. A KITCHEN BLACKBOARD, CU DAY
Written on it is: MONDAY 1.) CHURCH SPAYED 10 A.M. QUENTIN
JOLANDER, D.V.M. And below, in even bigger letters: 2.) ELLIE'S
FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL!!
THE CAMERA PANS LEFT, showing us the kitchen. There are still a
few cardboard cartons around, but the place is getting in shape.
We look out the window and see the CREEDS, led by JUD CRANDALL,
climbing the path toward the woods. LOUIS has got GAGE in a
Gerrypak.
EXT. AT THE TOP OF THE HILL, WITH CREEDS AND JUD
They are also at the edge of the woods. JUD stops and lets them
catch up.
JUD:
Take a look behind you.
They turn around, and their faces express their wonder.
LOUIS:
My God!
RACHEL:
It's beautiful!
EXT. THE VIEW
It is indeed beautiful. The CREED house is in the f.g., Route 9
just behind it (with one of the ever-present Orinco trucks droning

Page 16/68

along), but behind that is the great sweep of the Penobscot river
valley, dozing under a fall sky of clear blue.
EXT. AT THE TOP OF THE HILL, WITH JUD AND THE CREEDS
JUD:
You folks ready to go on?
LOUIS:
Sure.
ELLIE:
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
JUD:
You'll see soon enough, hon.
They go into the woods, still following the path.
EXT. FOREST DAY
These are old woods indeed--huge trunks with dusty sunlight
shafting through them. It looks as though man has never made his
mark here.
THE CAMERA PANS SLOWLY DOWN to them, on the path. Here it is
carpeted with pine needles, but it is just as clearly marked.
JUD stops. LOUIS looks glad of the rest; he's sweating and there
are wide dark patches under his arms where the Gerrypak's straps
are.
LOUIS:
Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper
companies?
JUD:
Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up
ahead is all that's left of their
tribal lands.
ELLIE (giggling)
Micmac, Ricmac, Kickmac, Sickmac.
JUD (smiles)
Ayuh, it's a funny word, ain't it?
You tired of totin' that yowwen yet, doc?
LOUIS:
Not yet...how much further is it?
JUD:

Page 17/68

Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.
He starts off again, fresh as a daisy. ELLIE scampers after him.
LOUIS rolls his eyes at his wife and RACHEL rolls hers back. Then
they press on.
EXT. THE ARCH READING PET SEMATARY
EXT. JUD AND THE CREEDS, ON THE PATH
JUD (stopping)
This is the place, honey.
ELLIE is of course second. Se tries to read the words on the arch
but can't. She whips around to look at her mother.
ELLIE:
What's it say, mommy?
A strange expression has come over RACHEL'S face--she doesn't like
this. Not a bit.
RACHEL:
It says Pet Cemetery, hon. It's
misspelled, but...that's what it
says.
She runs for the arch. RACHEL starts; looks more uneasy than ever.
RACHEL:
Ellen--!
EXT. ELLIE
She's almost under the arch. She looks back, questioning.
EXT. RACHEL, LOUIS, JUD
RACHEL (a bit lame)
Be careful.
EXT. ELLIE
She goes racing into the Pet Sematary.
EXT. RACHEL, LOUIS, JUD
JUD lights a cigarette with a wooden match, using his thumbnail.
JUD:
I told you it was a bad road,
Louis--it's killed a lot of pets
and made a lot of kids unhappy.
But at least something good come
of it. This place.
ELLIE (excited voice)
Mom! Dad! Y'oughtta see it!
EXT. ELLIE, AT THE EDGE OF THE SEMATARY
She surveys the rude markers with puzzled delight, then runs

Page 18/68

toward the center, pausing to investigate some of the markers as
she goes. We clearly see the symmetrical pattern of rings.
EXT. RACHEL, LOUIS, JUD
They are walking slowly toward that rude archway. LOUIS is
extremely interested in all this, but it's becoming clearer and
clearer that RACHEL is troubled. They stop and look in.
RACHEL:
How can you call it a good thing?
A graveyard for pets killed in the

road! Built and maintained by broken-
hearted children!

JUD:
Well, but Missus Creed! It ain't
quite that way, deah!
LOUIS:
I think it's rather extraordinary.
RACHEL:
Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.
She's growing more and more upset. JUD looks at her curiously.
JUD:
Well...they have to learn about death
somehow, now don't they, Missus Creed?
The little ones?
RACHEL (coldly)
Why?
JUD:
Well...well, because--
ELLIE (voice)
Mommy! Daddy! Look at me!
EXT. ELLIE, ON THE DEADFALL
She has begun to climb it, and this looks like an extremely
dangerous proposition. ELLIE, however, is having the time of her
life. A branch breaks under one of her feet and she switches
nimbly to the next one up.
EXT. THE GROWNUPS, AT THE ARCH
JUD (alarmed)
No, honey! You don't want to go
climbing on that! Come on down!

Page 19/68

He hurries in.
EXT. ELIIE, ON THE DEADFALL
She looks back at JUD.
ELLIE:
It's okay, Mr. Crandall--
EXT. ELLIE'S FOOT, CU
The branch she's on breaks with a dry CRRRACK. Her foot drops down
suddenly.
EXT. ELLIE AND JUD
She totters backward, pinwheeling her arms, and JUD catches her as
she falls. Not much of a catch because she wasn't too far up.
LOUIS joins JUD and ELLIE. GAGE jounces along on his back.
LOUIS:
Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?
ELLIE:
Well, I thought it was safe--
JUD:
Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns
like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite.
ELLIE:
Bite?
JUD:
Ayuh.
EXT. RACHEL, STANDING AT THE ARCH
Her discomfort makes one thing very clear--she doesn't want to
come in.
RACHEL (calls)
Is she all right, Louis?
EXT. LOUIS, JUD, ELLIE
LOUIS (calls back)
Fine! Come and see!
EXT. RACHEL, STANDING AT THE ARCH
RACHEL (calling)
I think I'll sit this one out, doc.
EXT. LOUIS, JUD, ELLIE--BY THE DEADFALL
ELLIE:
I want to look around, daddy--

Page 20/68

may I?
LOUIS:
For a little while.
JUD looks toward:
EXT. RACHEL AT THE ARCH (ELLEN IN F.G.)
RACHEL has retreated a bit. She sits on the pine needle carpet of
the path, opens her purse, and draws out cigarettes.
EXT. LOUIS AND JUD
JUD looks at LOUIS as if to say "What's all this about?" LOUIS
looks away.
ELLIE (voice)
Dad! Daddy! Look! A goldfishie!
EXT. ELLIE
She runs from one tombstone to the next, cheerful as maybe only a
kid could be in such a place. She looks at BIFFER'S tombstone; at
SMUCKY'S.
EXT. LOUIS AND JUD
They are walking slowly toward her. LOUIS is looking at the
tombstones.
LOUIS:
I can hardly read these.
JUD:
Ayuh--they get older as you go
toward the middle. (Points) Pete
LaVasseur's dog is buried there...
(points) the Stoppard boys' racing
pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat
got...and I think that's the cat
himself right there, although it's
been so many years I can't tell for
sure.
(calling)
Missy Ellen! Come over here just a
minute!
EXT. ELLEN
She runs amid the tombstones--they have worked their way near to
the center and there are quite a few of them--and joins the
adults.
JUD:
I see you're quite a reader for such

Page 21/68

a little girl. Can you read that?
He points again, and Ellen goes over for a look-see.
EXT. ELLEN, AT THE GRAVE MARKER
It is a small slate marker slanted to one side. ELLEN reads the
words laboriously, tracing them with her finger.
ELLEN:
"Spot a good fellow we love you boy."
(Pause) "Owned by Judson...Judson..."
Gee, I can't read the rest.
EXT. JUD AND LOUIS
JUD:
Last name's Crandall, little missy.
LOUIS looks at him sharply as ELLIE rejoins them.
JUD:
That's where I buried my dog Spot
when he died of old age in 19 and
14. Dug it good and deep. By the
time I finished, I had blisters all
over my hands and a hell of a crick
in my back. Soil's stony up here.
ELLIE looks awed. LOUIS looks a little awed, too.
JUD sweeps a hand around, indicating the whole sematary, but is
still looking at ELLEN.
JUD:
Do you know what this place is,
Ellie? Oh, I know you know it's a
boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing
and even a whole pile of 'em don't
amount to much. Do you know what a
graveyard really is?
ELLIE:
Well...I guess not.
JUD:
It's a place where the dead speak,
Missy.
He sees her startled, uneasy expression and laughs. He ruffles her
hair reassuringly.

Page 22/68

JUD:
No--not right out loud. Their stones
speak...or their markers. Even if the
marker ain't nothing but a tin can
someone wrote on with a Magic Marker,
it speaks. Ain't that so, Louis?
LOUIS:
I think it is so, Ellie.
ELLIE:
What if you can't read what's
written on there anymore?
JUD:
Well, it still says some animal got
laid down here after, don't it?
ELLIE:
Yes--
LOUIS:
And that someone cared enough about
that animal to mark the spot.
ELLIE:
To remember.
JUD (smiles)
Yes. To remember. This ain't a scary
place, Ellie. It's a place of rest
and speaking. Can you remember that?
ELLIE (a little awed)
Yes, sir.
They start to walk slowly back toward the arch.
EXT. RACHEL, OUTSIDE THE ARCH
It's clear she's impatient and out-of-sorts with the whole thing.
RACHEL (calls)
Louis, can we go? I'm tired!
EXT. LOUIS, ELLIE, JUD
ELLIE:
Mommy! This is a place where dead
animals talk! Mr. Crandall said so!
EXT. RACHEL AND ELLIE

Page 23/68

But RACHEL is not amused. She doesn't like any of this.
RACHEL (soft)
Did he.
EXT. LOUIS AND JUD
LOUIS:
My wife is not crazy about cemeteries
of any kind. As you may have noticed.
JUD:
Me neither. But I believe in knowing
your enemy.
LOUIS looks at him, startled, then decides this is a joke. He
laughs. JUD smiles, a trifle thinly.
EXT. THE ARCH, A NEW ANGLE
The men rejoin RACHEL and ELLIE.
LOUIS (voice)
Did we take too long?
RACHEL (curt)
Well, if supper's burned, I'm not
the one going out for pizza.
They move away.
EXT. THE DEADFALL, FROM THE ARCH
The face we saw at the beginning of the movie wasn't there when
the visitors were there...but it's sure there now, leering at us.
INT. THE KITCHEN TRASH CAN NIGHT
There are two greasy boxes poking out with NAPOLI PIZZA stamped on
them. Guess dinner was burned.
THE CAMERA PULLS BACK and we se LOUIS sitting at the kitchen
table. The table is covered with newspapers. On it, LOUIS is
putting together a complicated model boat, using glue and
tweezers. He's wearing glasses.
ELLIE comes in, wearing a nightgown. She watches him for awhile.
LOUIS (not looking around)
Hi, babe.
ELLIE:
Daddy, that Pet Sematary is there
because of the road, isn't it?
LOUIS looks around at her, surprised.
ELLIE:
That's what I think. I heard
Missy Dandridge tell Mom when

Page 24/68

Church was fixed he wouldn't
cross the road so much.
LOUIS:
Well, it's always better to take
precautions--but I'm sure Church
will be all right, honey...
INT. JUST OUTSIDE THE KITCHEN DOOR
RACHEL is coming along with some dirty dishes. She hears voices
and stops, listening, her face troubled and afraid.
ELLIE (voice)
No he won't! Not in the end! He won't
be all right in the end no matter how
you fix 'im!
INT. LOUIS AND ELLIE
Ellis has started to cry.
ELLIE:
In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he?
LOUIS:
Lovey...Church might be still alive when
you're in a high school...and that's a
very long time.
ELLIE:
It doesn't seem long to me. It seems
short. I think the whole thing about
pets dying s-s-sucks!
Poor kid's bawling her eyes out now. LOUIS folds her into his arms
and she hugs him tightly, wanting his comfort.
LOUIS:
If it was up to me I'd let Church live
to be a hundred...but I don't make up
the rules.
ELLIE (muffled)
Well who does? God, I suppose. But he's
not God's cat! He's my cat! Let God get
His own, if He wants one! Not mine! Not
mine! Not--
She breaks down completely, sobbing, and LOUIS rocks her back and
forth.
INT. THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE KITCHEN, WITH RACHEL

Page 25/68

She is crying silently.
INT. ELLIE'S BEDROOM NIGHT
She is a dimly perceived hump in the darkness. An oblong shaft of
light falls on her, illuminating her more clearly. She's asleep
with her teddy encircled by one arm and her thumb corked into her
mouth.
INT. THE DOORWAY, WITH RACHEL
RACHEL looks at her daughter with infinite love and then quietly
closes the door.
INT. LOUIS'S AND RACHEL'S BEDROOM NIGHT
LOUIS is in his pajamas, propped up on pillows on his side of the
bed. There a number of medical books scattered around him and he's
making notes from one as RACHEL comes in.
RACHEL:
She's finally asleep.
LOUIS:
She was a little over-excited,
that's all. Poor kid.
RACHEL:
It was that place. That creepy cemetery
up in the woods. Whatever disease the
kids in this town have got, I don't want
Ellie to catch it.
LOUIS:
Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
RACHEL:
Do you think I didn't hear her tonight,
crying as if her heart would break?
Here she is thinking Church is going to
die.
It should be clear to us by now that, despite her words, RACHEL is
much more upset than ELLIE was. LOUIS slowly puts his notebook
aside and caps his pen.
LOUIS:
Rachel...someday Church is going to
die.
RACHEL (whirls on him)
That is hardly the point! Church is

Page 26/68

not going to die today, or tomorrow--
Never mind. I can see you don't have
the slightest idea what I'm talking about.
She stalks to the bathroom, which adjoins. LOUIS follows. She goes
in and slams the door. He goes for the knob.
LOUIS:
Rachel--!
SOUND:
LOUIS stares at the door, bewildered and upset.
EXT. ROUTE 9 NIGHT
Here comes a big Orinco truck, droning along, headlights glaring.
INT. LOUIS'S AND RACHEL'S BEDROOM
The headlights of the truck illuminate the room and we see LOUIS
and RACHEL asleep, each as far over to his/her own side as he/she
can get, with a big empty space in the middle.
Lights and TRUCK SOUNDS slowly fade.
INT. GAGE MORNING
Cheerful little clots of scrambled eggs are scattered all the way
across the tray of his high-chair--it looks a little like a map of
the Pacific islands done by a guy who only had a yellow crayon.
Now he scoops up a handful and throws them.
INT. THE KITCHEN TABLE, WITH ELLIE
Splat! Eggs on the serving plate of toast.
ELLIE:
Yee-uck! Gross!
INT. THE KITCHEN, A WIDER SHOT
RACHEL is at the sink, doing dishes (we see the blackboard with
its message near her).
LOUIS comes in, wearing a sport-coat and slacks, ready for his
first day on the job...and ELLIE is in a pretty first day of
school dress.
LOUIS:
He can't help it, babe. Emily Post is
going to be beyond him for a few years.
INT. BY THE KITCHEN DOOR
Here is the cat-carrier with CHURCH inside it. He waows unhappily.
INT. THE KITCHEN TABLE, WITH ELLIE AND GAGE
ELLIE gets down and goes across to the cat-carrier.
ELLIE:

Page 27/68

I don't want him to get his nuts
cut, daddy! What if he dies?
INT. RACHEL AND LOUIS, BY THE SINK
LOUIS looks shocked and amused by ELLIE'S colorful choice of
words.
LOUIS:
Good God! Where'd you hear that?
INT. ELLIE
ELLIE:
Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a
operation!
INT. RACHEL AND LOUIS, BY THE SINK
LOUIS tries to kiss RACHEL'S mouth. She turns her head slightly so
he gets her cheek instead. She's still mad. LOUIS'S amusement
dies.
RACHEL:
Honey, Church will be fine.
INT. ELLIE, BY THE CAT CARRIER
ELLIE:
But what if he dies and has to
go to the Pet Sematary?
INT. LOUIS AND RACHEL, BY THE SINK
She gives him a look as if to say: "There! Now do you understand
what you did?"
RACHEL:
Don't be silly. Church is not going
to die.
LOUIS:
According to what Mr. Crandall says, the
road's a lot more dangerous than the
operation. Church will be just the same.
Well--almost the same--and we won't have
to worry about him getting turned into
catburgers by one of those damn Orinco
trucks.
At this RACHEL tightens up still more in that funny way--she's
actually angered by LOUIS'S reference to catburgers--but under the
anger we sense she is deeply shocked, as a prudish woman might be

Page 28/68

shocked by a dirty joke. For RACHEL, that's just what death is.
RACHEL:
That's enough of that kind of talk!
LOUIS:
I just said--
RACHEL:
I know what you just said. Ellie,
clear your place.
ELLIE goes slowly back to the table.
ELLIE (sets the plate down)
I'm scared. What if school here isn't
like in Chicago! I'm scared and I want
to go h-h-home!
ELLIE bursts into loud tears and puts her hands over her face.
INT. THE KITCHEN, A NEW ANGLE (FEATURES LOUIS AND RACHEL)
THE CAMERA FOLLOWS as they go to the table to comfort ELLIE.
RACHEL:
You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be
excused. Go and wash your face.
LOUIS:
And Church will be fine.
ELLIE (anxious)
Do you promise, Daddy?
LOUIS:
Well, honey...you know that...
RACHEL:
Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give
the little girl her promise.
LOUIS (reluctantly)
Church will be fine. I promise.
ELLIE:
Yayyyy!
She runs off, cheered up. And RACHEL is cheered up, too.
RACHEL:
Thank you, Louis.

Page 29/68

LOUIS:

Oh, you're welcome. Only if some-
thing should go wrong while he's under

the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot,
but it happens--you explain to her.
He gets up and leaves the table. She looks after him, stunned and
a little frightened.
INT. GAGE
GAGE (conversationally)
Here, Durch!
He picks up a large glob of scrambled eggs from his tray and
throws it in the direction of the cat-carrier.
INT. THE CAT-CARRIER
CHURCH is close to the mesh, looking out. Scrambled eggs hit the
mesh, driving him back, surprised.
EXT. THE CREED HOUSE MORNING
The school bus pulls up, red lights flashing. ELLIE runs toward it
across the lawn, with her lunch-box.
EXT. LOUIS, RACHEL, AND GAGE, IN THE FRONT DOORWAY
RACHEL:
Have a great day!
LOUIS grabs GAGE'S hand and makes him wave it.
GAGE:
Bye-bye!
EXT. THE BUS
ELLIE climbs aboard. The red flashers go out and the bus pulls
away.
EXT. THE CREED DRIVEWAY MORNING
The station wagon is parked there. LOUIS comes out with a heavy
briefcase in one hand and the cat-carrier in the other. He opens
the wagon's doorgate.
A small car turns into the CREED driveway and parks beside LOUIS.
A rather sour-looking middle-aged woman gets out and crosses the
front of her car. Her color is bad. This is MISSY DANDRIDGE. She
looks at the cat-carrier.
MISSY:
Gonna get his--
LOUIS:
--nuts cut, yes. Thank you, Missy,

Page 30/68

for introducing that colorful phrase
into my daughter's vocabulary.
MISSY:
Don't mention it.
She opens the passenger side door of her car and we see a big neat
pile of folded sheets. She reaches for them, then winces and
presses her hands against her midriff for a moment, as if with an
attack of indigestion.
LOUIS (sees this)
How's that belly-ache of yours?
MISSY (gets the sheets)
No better and no worse.
LOUIS:
You ought to see a doctor about it.
MISSY:
It'll pass. They always do.
She starts toward the house with the sheets.
EXT. THE SIDE YARD MORNING
RACHEL hurries past MISSY, who turns to look and then goes on into
the house. LOUIS has just put the cat-carrier into the back of the
wagon and closed the doorgate as RACHEL reaches him.
RACHEL (anxious)
Still friends, doc?
LOUIS appears to consider this seriously for a moment...and then
he smiles and hugs her. They kiss.
RACHEL:
Thank God. I was a little worried
there. Have a great first day at
school, doc. No broken bones.
LOUIS (smiles)
Not so much as a sprain.
EXT. VICTOR PASCOW AND FRIENDS MORNING
PASCOW is in a blanket that is being carried by three boys and one
girl. They are all yelling at each other not to joggle him, not to
drop him. A small knot of horrified college kids moves with the
bearers.
PASCOW'S head is upside down to the CAMERA, which retreats ahead
of the advancing students. Fixed eyes stare. Half of his head has
been shattered inward. Before the catastrophe he was a husky male
of about twenty. He's dressed in a U of M muscle shirt and red

Page 31/68

jogging shorts.
THE CAMERA PULLS JERKILY TO ONE SIDE, allowing the bearers to
mount the steps of a brick building. The infirmary. The lookers-on
break to either side. The infirmary doors open.
EXT.. NURSE CHARLTON, AT THE DOORS
She's the head nurse, a tough old babe of about fifty.
CHARLTON:
Holy Jesus.
(turns)
Steve! Steve! Dr. Creed! Dr. Creed,
we've got a mess here! Stat!
The bearers sweep past her and inside, leaving a red smear of
blood across the midriff of MARCY CHARLTON'S uniform.
INT. THE INFIRMARY RECEPTION AREA
THE CAMERA will show us all we need to see, but its movements will
seem almost random; this is like being in the hotel kitchen after
Sirhan shot Bobby.
As the students bring in PASCOW, LOUIS comes running, followed by
STEVE MASTERTON, his P.A. Standing to one side are two student
nurses in candystriper uniforms. They're boggled and horrified.
LOUIS kneels. THE CAMERA RUSHES FORWARD, shoving between
onlookers. LOUIS looks at the wound. There's shattered bone and
pulsing brain tissue beneath.
There's a scream; the girl who was carrying one corner of the
blanket is having hysterics.
GIRL:
Vic! Vic! Oh Christ! Vic!
LOUIS (to CHARLTON)
Get her out. Get them all out.
CHARLTON puts her arms around the girl.
GIRL (struggling)
No! No! He can't die! He can't die!
THE CAMERA MOVES BACK DOWN as LOUIS takes an opthalmascope from
STEVE and shines it in PASCOW'S bulging, fixed eyes.
CHARLTON is just pushing the last of them gawkers and bearers out
the door.
LOUIS:
Steve, get the ambulance over here
right now. He's got to go to EMMC.
STEVE:

Page 32/68

The ambulance is at Sonny's Sunoco
downtown, getting--
LOUIS:
--a new muffler, oh shit--
PASCOW makes a weird gargling noise. Blood suddenly spurts out of
his mouth. He begins to seizure.
One of the candystripers shrieks. THE CAMERA JERKS UP TO COVER the
student nurses. One turns and throws up on the wall.
CHARLTON rushes over.
CANDYSTRIPER:
I can't look at it...I can't stand it...
CHARLTON (slaps her)
Yes you by God can. Go get the hard
stretcher!
As they start away, one helping the other down the hall, and as
CHARLTON starts over to where PASCOW lies dying on his blanket,
THE CAMERA DROPS TO LOUIS AND STEVE.
LOUIS:
Help me hold him.
They hold PASCOW'S spasming body.
STEVE:
It wouldn't matter if we did have
the ambulance.
LOUIS:
It wouldn't matter if we had the SST.
PASCOW begins to quiet.
LOUIS:

He's going. Steve, go call the motor-
pool. Marcy, roll out the crash wagon.

CHARLTON:
It won't--
LOUIS:
I know it won't! But let's for God's
sake do it by the rules!
She leaves. LOUIS is alone with PASCOW. CHARLTON has drawn the
drapes, so the doctor and the dying man have complete if temporary

Page 33/68

privacy.
INT. LOUIS AND PASCOW, A CLOSER SHOT
LOIS:
There wasn't even supposed to be a
sprain today, my friend--that's what
I told her.
PASCOW'S fixed eyes suddenly roll and his left hand bear-traps
LOUIS'S right wrist. The dying man pulls him slowly but
relentlessly down, until their faces are only inches apart.
PASCOW:
...Pet Sematary...
LOUIS recoils, breaking the grip of the hand...but he cannot quite
snap the grip of those bright dying eyes. Blood leaks from
PASCOW'S mouth.
LOUIS (whispers)
W-What did you say...?
PASCOW struggles hard to speak again. At first he can only gurgle.
PASCOW:
It's not the real cemetery...
(Long pause) The soil of a man's
heart is stonier, Louis...a man
grows what he can...and tends it.
LOUIS leans forward again, terrified, yet needing to know.
LOUIS:
How do you know my name?
PASCOW (gurgling)
I'll come...to you.
LOUIS grabs PASCOW'S bloody shoulder.
LOUIS (low but urgent)
Dammit, how do you know my name?
INT. HALLWAY ENTRANCE TO RECEPTION, WITH STEVE
STEVE:
Louis, they're sending a--
INT. LOUIS AND PASCOW
PASCOW begins to spasm again.
LOUIS (snaps)
Help me!
PASCOW spews more blood as STEVE kneels beside LOUIS.
INT. THE MAIN INFIRMARY HALLWAY

Page 34/68

CHARLTON is pushing along your basic MEDCU goodie-cart, covered
with emergency life-saving gear.
INT. LOUIS, STEVE, PASCOW
PASCOW'S spasms are weakening.
LOUIS (to CHARLTON)
Never mind. He's going.
PASCOW'S hand comes up and paws at LOUIS'S shirt, leaving a bloody
handprint. Then it falls limply back. PASCOW is dead.
LOUIS:
Steve, will you get a sheet to cover
him with?
STEVE leaves the frame and LOUIS stares fixedly down at the body
of VICTOR PASCOW. He closes the eyes.
EXT. A COUNTRY ROAD, LATE AFTERNOON
It's the leading edge of Maine fall, sunny and wonderful. Here
comes LOUIS'S station wagon. As it reaches THE CAMERA, it swivels
to TRACK.
RADIO (voice-over)
Tragedy struck on the first day of the
University of Maine's fall semester
when Victor Pascow, a nineteen-year-old
sophomore--
INT. THE CAR, WITH LOUIS
He still looks shocked by the tragedy. The dying man's bloody
handprint is partly visible on LOUIS'S shirt in spite of his
sport-coat.
LOUIS abruptly turns off the radio and swerves over to the side of
the road.
EXT. THE STATION WAGON
IT comes to a slueing, shuddering stop, almost going in the ditch.
INT. LOUIS, BEHIND THE WHEEL
LOUIS:
He said my name. I heard it. He
said my name.
He stares blankly through the windshield.
EXT. THE CREED HOUSE NIGHT
All lights are off. It's late.
INT. THE CREED BEDROOM NIGHT
LOUIS and RACHEL are asleep, each on his/her own side of the big
double. THE CAMERA MOVES IN ON LOUIS.
SOUND:

Page 35/68

dead.
LOUIS sits up. Beside him, RACHEL sleeps on. LOUIS'S eyes widen in
terror as he stares at:
INT. THE DOORWAY, WITH PASCOW
He's exquisitely dead. Now pallid as well as smashed up.
PASCOW:
Come on, doc. We got places to go.
INT. LOUIS
He is in terror...but he is also in a state of near-trance.
INT. PASCOW
PASCOW:
Come on, doc--don't make me tell you
twice.
INT. LOUIS
He glances at RACHEL. Although PASCOW has spoken in a fairly loud
voice--and the opening door was like a bomb--she's still fast
asleep. LOUIS looks back toward PASCOW...and then gets out of bed.
He's naked except for a pair of pajama bottoms.
INT. PASCOW
He turns and leaves the doorway.
INT. LOUIS
He reaches the bedroom doorway himself and looks back at:
INT. THE BED, LOUIS'S POV
RACHEL is sleeping as before, and LOUIS himself is also in bed
asleep, although his rest is uneasy...as if he's having a bad
dream.
INT. THE DOORWAY, WITH LOUIS
LOUIS (relieved)
Oh. Thank God.
PASCOW (Voice)
Hurry up, doc.
INT. THE KITCHEN
LOUIS enters and crosses toward the door which gives on the
shed/garage. This door stands open. LOUIS pauses by it.
PASCOW (low)
Come on, doc...
LOUIS goes into:
INT. THE SHED/GARAGE
The station wagon is a dark hulk. LOUIS crosses to it and stands,
perplexed.
PASCOW looms softly behind him and puts an arm around him. LOUIS

Page 36/68

turns... and suddenly his face is less than an inch from PASCOW'S
mutilated face.
PASCOW:
Let's go, doc.
LOUIS (moans)
I don't like this dream.
PASCOW:
Who said you were dreaming?
He begins to move toward the garage door. After a moment LOUIS
follows him.
EXT. THE FIELD BEHIND THE HOUSE, LONG NIGHT
We can see two shapes moving up the path toward the woods--PASCOW
and, behind him, LOUIS.
EXT. THE PET SEMATARY ARCH
CAMERA HOLDS, THEN PANS DOWN as LOUIS passes under the arch.
EXT. LOUIS, CLOSE
He looks around, obviously afraid.
EXT. THE PET SEMATARY, LOUIS'S POV
We can see why. By starlight this is one scary place.
EXT. LOUIS
He suddenly sees something else, and now his fear is close to
terror.
EXT. THE DEADFALL, LOUIS'S POV
The face is back in the tumbled branches. It yawns and snarls.
EXT. LOUIS
He walks toward the deadfall as if hypnotized. PASCOW'S hand falls
on his shoulder. LOUIS turns, terrified.
EXT. PASCOW, CLOSE
He really is a dreadful mangled mess.
PASCOW:
This is the place where the dead speak.
EXT. LOUIS
He closes his eyes.
LOUIS:
I want to wake up. I want to wake up,
that's all. I--
EXT. LOUIS AND PASCOW
PASCOW:
The door must not be opened. The

Page 37/68

barrier must not be crossed. Don't
go on, doc. No matter how much you
feel you have to. There's more
power here than you know.
He points at:
EXT. THE DEADFALL
That grinning face--and perhaps now there are other effects as
well, subtle but there? Dim red light? A misty smoke drifting
through the tumbled dead branches? The director will know.
After a moment there is a HUGE GRUNTING ROAR from the woods behind
the deadfall--it sounds like no animal we've ever heard before.
There is the sound of something huge shifting and snapping a tree
like a toothpick.
EXT. PASCOW AND LOUIS
LOUIS has crumbled to PASCOW'S feet. His eyes are squeezed tightly
shut.
LOUIS:
Please, I want to wake up. Leave me
alone. It's not my fault you died; you
were as good as dead when they brought
you in--
PASCOW:
The power of this place is old and
always restless. Sometimes the dead
do more than speak. Remember, doc.
CAMERA BEGINS MOVING SLOWLY IN ON LOUIS.
LOUIS:
Leave me alone!
PASCOW:
Remember.
CAMERA IS TIGHT ON LOUIS.
RADIO (voice)
--another beautiful day in Maine!
This is Michael O'Hara sayin' that
the git-go ain't gonna be that bad.
Temps are going all the way up to 70...
We got the Ramones for Ludlow...here's
"Sheena."
As the Ramones start blasting "Sheena Is A Punk Rocker":

Page 38/68

INT. LOUIS, IN BED
His eyes snap open. He's in his own bedroom. As he sits up THE
CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS OUT so we can see that he's in bed alone; the
covers on RACHEL'S side are thrown back.
After the initial confusion and fear, LOUIS looks deeply relieved;
he looks the way I suppose we all look upon waking up and
realizing our worst dreams were only dreams after all.
RACHEL (calls)
You up, doc?
LOUIS:
Getting there.
RACHEL:
I got eggs down here!
LOUIS:
Good d--
He throws the covers back and freezes.
INT. LOUIS'S FEET, LOUIS'S POV
They are covered with mud and pine needles. The sheets are greased
with woods-muck.
INT. LOUIS, CU
Utter terror.
INT. THE LAUNDRY CHUTE, CU
LOUIS'S hands enter the shot and dump a bundle of sheets into the
chute.
INT. LOUIS, IN THE UPSTAIRS HALL
He's naked but for a towel around his waist. He's obviously fresh
from the shower.
He starts down to the bedroom to dress.
BLACK. And on it a third title card: CHURCH.
Over this the SOUND of a RINGING TELEPHONE.
LOUIS (voice)
Hello?
INT. THE CREED LIVING ROOM AFTERNOON
There's a bowling match on TV. LOUIS, dressed in his Saturday
afternoon grubs (jeans and a Maine sweatshirt), has the phone to
his ear.
JUD CRANDALL (phone filter)
Louis? 'Fraid you may have a spot of
trouble.
LOUIS (frowning)
Jud? What trouble?

Page 39/68

INT. THE CRANDALL LIVING ROOM, WITH JUD
He's on the phone, looking out his window.
JUD:
Did you tell me Rachel took the
kids back to Chicago for a few days?
INT. THE CREED LIVING ROOM, WITH LOUIS
LOUIS:
For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't
go because her old man thinks I'm a

shit and the feeling is heartily re-
ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow

night. Jud, what's this about?
INT. THE CRANDALL LIVING ROOM, WITH JUD
JUD:
Well, there's a dead cat over here on
the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it
might be your daughter's.
INT. THE CREED LIVING ROOM, WITH LOUIS
LOUIS:
Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.
EXT. THE CRANDALL HOUSE, MEDIUM-LONG
We're looking across from the CREED lawn. LOUIS waits for one of
those trucks to go blasting by and then crosses. It's cold and
windy. Downed autumn leaves fly.
LOUIS and JUD stand over a small furry body like mourners.
JUD (voice)
Well?
EXT. THE CAT'S BODY
It's lying on its belly and doesn't look much damaged. Hands--
LOUIS'S--come into the frame. He puts one hand under the cat's
head and lifts it so the open eyes, now a dull green, stare into
THE CAMERA. There's some blood on its ruff. That's all.
EXT. LOUIS AND JUD, ON THE EDGE OF THE CRANDALL LAWN
LOUIS:
It's Church.
JUD:
I'm sorry. At least it don't look like
he suffered.

Page 40/68

LOUIS:
Ellie will, though. She'll suffer plenty.
From his jacket pocket he takes a green plastic garbage bag and
hands it to JUD. JUD holds the bag's mouth open on the ground
while LOUIS kind of shoves the body in. During this:
JUD:
Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?
LOUIS:
Yes.
LOUIS twists the bag shut and puts one of those plastic ties on
it. Then he holds it up.
LOUIS:
Bagged cat. What a mess.
JUD:
You going to bury him in the Pet
Sematary?
LOUIS (a little bitter)
I guess that's what it's there for, huh?
During all of this JUD has grown peculiarly intense.
JUD:
Going to tell Ellie?
LOUIS:
I don't know.
JUD:
Seems like you told me about a promise
you made--
INT. THE CREED KITCHEN MORNING
GAGE is in his high chair. ELLIE, in her first-day-of-school
dress, is in her place. LOUIS is sitting at his own place staring,
hypnotized, at the middle of the table, where there is a large
serving dish. On the dish is scrambled eggs, strips of bacon, and
CHURCH'S corpse--staring eyes, bloody ruff and all.
RACHEL (impatiently)
Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the
little girl her promise.
EXT. THE CRANDALL LAWN, WITH JUD AND LOUIS

Page 41/68

LOUIS (defensive)
That was a mistake. But Rachel...
she doesn't like to talk about
death, or even think of it. Her
younger sister died of spinal
meningitis when Rachel was eight.
Rachel was there when it happened.
Alone. I guess you could say it
made a complex.
JUD:
Cat's just as dead, Louis.
LOUIS (snaps)
Well that's a big help! (Pause) I'm
sorry, Jud.
JUD:
No need to apologize.
LOUIS:
Maybe when they call I'll just tell
Ellie I haven't seen the damn cat
around. You know?
JUD (after a long pause)
Maybe there's a better way.
EXT. THE START OF THE PATH TO THE PET SEMATARY, LONG EVENING
LOUIS and JUD cross the road from the CRANDALL side. LOUIS is
carrying the plastic bag in one hand and a flashlight in the
other. JUD has a pick and shovel in one hand and a flashlight of
his own in the other.
Evening shadows have grown long. It's maybe an hour until dark.
JUD and LOUIS stop near the replaced tire-swing.
EXT. LOUIS AND JUD
JUD has a Walkman clipped to the belt of his pants and earphones
slung around his neck.
LOUIS:
Jud, this is crazy. It's going to
be almost dark before we get back.
JUD:
It's going to be dark before we even
get where we're going, Louis. But
we can do it...and we're going to.

Page 42/68

LOUIS:
But--
JUD:
Does she love the cat?
LOUIS:
Yes, but--
JUD:
Then come on.
He puts the earphones on, effectively forestalling further
argument, and pushes the PLAY button on the Walkman. We can hear
Marshall Crenshaw singing "Crystal Girl." JUD starts away. After a
moment, LOUIS follows.
EXT. THE PET SEMATARY AND THE BACK OF THE ARCH LATE EVENING
The SOUND of crickets...ree-ree-ree...
The SOUND of footfalls.
Faintly, the SOUND of Huey Lewis and the News, singing "Working
For A Living."
It's now almost twilight.
JUD and LOUIS enter the Pet Sematary. LOUIS is looking around
curiously.
LOUIS:
Well, folks, here we are, in Louis
Creed Dreamland.
JUD snaps off the Walkman and puts the earphones around his neck
again.
JUD:
What say, Louis?
LOUIS:
Nothing. (Pause) Do we plant him on
the outer circle or start a new one?
JUD:
We're still not where we're going.
He walks past LOUIS and toward the deadfall. LOUIS follows.
LOUIS:
What do you mean?

Page 43/68

JUD:
The place we're going is on the
other side of that.
He points at the deadfall.
LOUIS:
We can't climb over that. We'll break
our necks!
JUD:
No. We won't. I have climbed it a time
or two before, and I know all the places
to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't
look down...and don't stop. If you stop,
you'll crash through for sure.
LOUIS:
I'm not climbing that.
JUD:
Give me the cat. I'll take care of it
myself.
He holds out his hand and LOUIS sees the old man means exactly as
he says. After a moment he says:
LOUIS:
Let's go.
JUD starts up one side of the deadfall, and in spite of its
snarled tangles, he mounts as easily as a man climbing a flight of
stairs. After a few second, LOUIS follows.
LOUIS (low)
Thank God my Blue Cross is paid up.
EXT. THEIR FEET
First JUD'S pass THE CAMERA, then LOUIS'S, partly obscured by the
swinging cat-bag. Their feet unerringly find the right branches
and just as unerringly miss holes which look like ankle-breakers.
EXT. LOUIS
He's grinning, exhilarated.
LOUIS:
God, this is amazing!
EXT. JUD
There are beads of sweat on the old man's face. He looks both

Page 44/68

stern and a little scared.
JUD:
Just don't stop and--
EXT. LOUIS
He looks down.
EXT. LOUIS'S FEET
A dead branch snaps under one of them like a gunshot and that foot
plunges down maybe six inches.
EXT. LOUIS
He lurches to the edge of balance, then regains it.
LOUIS:
And don't look down. Right.
He continues.
EXT. THE DEADFALL, REVERSE TWILIGHT
JUD reaches the top and starts down the far side. LOUIS reaches
the top.
EXT. LOUIS
LOUIS (amazed)
Holy...!
EXT. BIG GOD WOODS, LOUIS'S POV

In the dying glow of twilight, this should be a mystic, awe-
inspiring shot. There's no more scrub underbrush and junk pines

and juniper-bracken here; ancient firs rise almost like Sequoias.
The sunset light shafts among them. This is a real forest... an

old forest. And winding upward among the trees along that needle-
carpeted floor, clearly marked by large white stones, the path

goes on.
EXT. LOUIS
He's stopped on top of the deadfall, still surveying all this with
frank amazement.
EXT. JUD
JUD (turns to look)
Come on, Louis--don't stop!
EXT. LOUIS, ATOP THE DEADFALL
LOUIS (grinning)
I'm all right! I'm f--
EXT. LOUIS'S FEET
One of the branches snaps. LOUIS'S foot plunges. His cuff rips.
EXT. LOUIS, JUD'S POV

We're looking up at a fairly steep angle as LOUIS staggers off-
balance. He steps with his other foot, misses, and goes flying.

EXT. LOUIS, CLOSER

Page 45/68

He does a half-somersault in the air and hits the deadfall on his
back, the green garbage bag flying out of his hand. His flashlight
also goes. Branches crack. White dust puffs out from under him.
EXT. JUD, AT THE BASE OF THE DEADFALL
LOUIS thumps to the ground nearby. JUD kneels beside him.
JUD:
Louis! You all right?
LOUIS sits up groggily. His pants are torn. His sweatshirt is
torn. His ankle is bleeding.
LOUIS (dazed)
Sure. I guess I just lost my happy
thoughts for a second there.
LOUIS gets slowly up and retrieves the bag, which is rather
shredded now--and we can see catfur through some of the rents.
LOUIS (continues)
I shouldn't have stopped...and it
does bite.
He whaps the flashlight against his palm a time or two and the
light comes on. Satisfied, he shuts it off.
JUD:
No, you shouldn't have stopped. But
you got away with it. Important thing
is are you sure you're all right?
LOUIS:
Yes. (Pause) Where are we going, Jud?
JUD:
You'll see before long. Let's go.
He starts off up the path. After a moment LOUIS follows, carrying
the bag.
EXT. LOUIS AND JUD, FROM THE DEADFALL
Again, there should be a sense of awe and mystery as they go
tolling up the path into the twilight, dwarfed by those ancient
firs.
SOUND OF CRICKETS, LOW at first, then UP TO LOUD: Ree-ree-ree...
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. LOUIS AND JUD, AT THE EDGE OF LITTLE GOD SWAMP TWILIGHT
Lots of undergrowth here, and creeping ground-mist, too. The SOUND
OF CRICKETS is now only a part of the soundtrack: BUZZ OF CICADAS,
THUMP OF FROGS. Swamp-sounds.

Page 46/68

LOUIS looks frankly doubtful.
JUD:
This next bit's like the deadfall, Louis--
you got to walk steady and easy. Just follow
me and don't look down.
EXT. LITTLE GOD SWAMP, LOUIS'S AND JUD'S POV DEEP TWILIGHT
Mysterious...awesome...scary. Dead trees poke out of the murk like
twisted hands. There's scummy water standing around tussocks
covered with long grass, most of it dead. There's a lot of choking
underbrush.
All of this fades away into a grim, obscuring fog.
EXT. LOUIS AND JUD
JUD:
Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp.
LOUIS:
Is there quicksand?
JUD:
Ayuh.
LOUIS (nervous; joking)
Are there ghosts?
JUD looks at him expressionlessly.
JUD:
Ayuh.
JUD starts off, stepping to the first tussock. After a moment,
LOUIS follows.
EXT. JUD, CU
His face is set, strange.
JUD:
There's a lot of funny things down
this way, Louis.
EXT. LOUIS, BEHIND JUD
LOUIS:
You're telling me.
EXT. JUD
JUD (still walking)
The air's heavier...more electrical...
something. You might see St. Elmo's

Page 47/68

Fire...what the sailors call 'foo-lights.'
It makes funny shapes, but it's nothing.
EXT. LOUIS
HE looks up and his eyes widen as he sees:
EXT. ANGLE ON LITTLE GOD SWAMP, LOUIS'S POV
A faintly glowing, ethereal shape hangs in the branches of one of
the dead trees. It looks a bit like a corpse. In fact, I think it
looks quite a bit like PASCOW'S corpse.
As we watch it fades...fades...is gone.
EXT. LOUIS
He's somewhere between being mystified and puzzled and being
scared. Now a weakly glowing fireball rolls slowly across the
surface of the standing water toward him...and then just fades
into the thick mist.
LOUIS:
It's funny, all right.
EXT. JUD
JUD:
Just don't stop, Louis. You don't
ever want to stop down here in
Little God. (Pause) And you don't
ever want to look behind you,
whatever you hear.
EXT. JUD AND LOUIS, LONG ANGLE NIGHT
We see them moving through the mist like wraiths, JUD with his
digging tools, LOUIS with his light and his Hefty-Bag coffin. The
whole swamp is glowing dimly.
EXT. THE FAR SIDE OF LITTLE GOD SWAMP NIGHT
In the extreme f.g. we can see firm ground sloping up. Ahead is a
thick white mist. And here comes JUD and LOUIS slogging through it
and out of it. Both of them are wet from the knees down. They head
into the woods on the far side.
EXT. A LOW, STONY BLUFF OR STEEP HILL
In the book this is described as being almost a cliff, but a rocky
hill rising out of the woods would serve just as well. We can see
steps cut into the side, and two figures--LOUIS and JUD--toiling
up them.
EXT. JUD AND LOUIS, A CLOSER SHOT
JUD'S panting and out of breath; LOUIS is, if anything, in worse
shape.
JUD:

Page 48/68

Almost there, Louis.
LOUIS:
You keep saying that.
JUD:
This time I mean it.
He tops the last step and stands on a rocky level under the stars,
the wind blowing his hair off his deeply lined brow. A few moments
later LOUIS joins him and stares with undisguised wonder.
EXT. THE MICMAC BURYING GROUND, LOUIS AND JUD'S POV
The top of this hill or bluff is rocky and bare, but there are a
number of rocky piles. But for every pile of rocks we can see,
there are ten littered heaps, as if the neat piles had been burst
apart. There's a shape to all of this, and it is the shape of the
Pet Sematary:
SOUND:
EXT. LOUIS AND JUD, AT THE EDGE OF THE BURYING GROUND
LOUIS (awed)
What is this place?
JUD:
This was their burying ground, Louis.
LOUIS:
Whose burying ground?
JUD:
The Micmac Indians. I brought you here
to bury Ellen's cat.
LOUIS:
Why? For God's sake, why?
JUD:
I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later.
All right?
LOUIS:
I guess so...but...
JUD:

Page 49/68

You want to rest a bit before you start?
LOUIS:
No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to
dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.
JUD:
Soil's thin, all right. But you'll manage.
He hands him the pick and shovel.
JUD:
I'm going to sit over yonder and have a
smoke. I'd help you, but you've got to
do it yourself. Each buries his own.
That's how it was done then.
JUD walks away, leaving LOUIS with the digging tools in one hand
and the flashlight in the other. After a minute, LOUIS walks out
into the burying ground.
EXT. LOOKING DOWN INTO A SHALLOW HOLE NIGHT
SOUND:
The hole's about two and a half feet deep. Stubby rocks protrude
from the sides. The pick comes down, hits a rock at the bottom,
and flashes fire.
EXT. LOUIS
He drops the pick and sticks his hurt hands in his armpits. Beside
him we see a low pile of rocks and earth.
JUD (voice)
Should be deep enough.
He joins LOUIS. He's got a lot of rocks in his arms.
LOUIS:
You think so?
He notices the rocks.
LOUIS:
What are those for?
JUD:
Your cairn.
EXT. THE MICMAC BURYING GROUND, LOUIS'S POV
Those tumbled piles of rock are very obvious.
EXT. LOUIS AND JUD, BY CHURCH'S GRAVE

Page 50/68

LOUIS:
Doesn't look like they last long.
JUD:
Don't worry about that.
LOUIS:
Jud, why am I doing all this?
JUD:
Because it's right.
He walks off again.
LOUIS looks after him for a moment, then kneels down.
EXT. LOUIS, BY THE GARBAGE BAG
He opens it and looks in at CHURCH'S stiffening corpse.
LOUIS:
Pax vobiscum, Church old buddy. You
were a hell of a god cat. I doubt if
you were worth all this aggravation,
but you were a hell of a good cat.
He tumbles the bag containing the body into the grave, and then
begins pushing the stony soil over it with the spade.
EXT. THE CAIRN, CU NIGHT
LOUIS'S hands come into the frame and add a final two or three
stones.
EXT. LOUIS, BY THE CAIRN
He looks at it for a moment and stands up. JUD is right there.
JUD:
That's fine. You did real good.
LOUIS looks at him.
EXT. THE CREED HOUSE NIGHT
There's a light on in the kitchen, but that's all. There's silence
at first, and then the PHONE STARTS RINGING.
EXT. LOUIS'S FIELD NIGHT
LOUIS and JUD are coming down the path with their tools and their
lights. They are both clearly fagged out.
SOUND, FAINT:
LOUIS:
Oh, shit! Rachel!
He drops the tools and sprints.

Page 51/68

EXT. THE CREED'S SIDE YARD, BY THE TIRE SWING
LOUIS runs into the side yard. SOUND of the phone is louder.
EXT. THE KITCHEN DOOR OF THE CREED HOUSE, WITH LOUIS
He runs to the door and inside.
EXT. THE END OF THE PATH, WITH JUD
He stands there, eyes inscrutable.
INT. THE LIVING ROOM, WITH THE PHONE
It stops. A beat later LOUIS enters the room. He picks it up,
although he already knows it's too late. He listens to the SOUND
of the dial tone and then drops it back into the cradle,
disgusted.
He starts to dial a number from memory.
JUD (voice)
Louis.
INT. THE KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM DOORWAY, WITH JUD
JUD:
When you talk to 'em, not one word
about what we done tonight. 'S'far's
you know, the cat's still fine.
INT. LOUIS, BY THE PHONE
After a moment he lowers it into the cradle.
INT. JUD
JUD:
You'll understand. In the meantime,
keep your peace. What we did, Louis,
was a secret thing. Women are supposed
to be the ones who are good at
keeping secrets, but any woman who
knows anything at all would tell you
she's never seen into a man's heart.
The soil of a man's heart is stonier,
Louis--like the soil up there in the
old Micmac burying ground. A man
grows what he can...and tends it.
During this, he's come across the room to LOUIS and dropped his
hand on LOUIS'S shoulder.
LOUIS:
But--
JUD:
No buts! Accept what's done, Louis.

Page 52/68

What we done was right. Another time
it might not be, but tonight it was...
at least I hope to Christ it was. Now
you make your call...but not a word
about tonight.
EXT. THE ROAD, WITH JUD
SOUNDS:
DORY GOLDMAN (voice)
Goldman residence.
LOUIS:
Hi, Dory...it's Louis--
During this, another SOUND has been growing: an approaching truck.
As JUD gains his side of the road, he looks back, and we read fear
on his face--no matter what he said to LOUIS, he's sorry for
tonight's piece of work.
A moment later a highballing Orinco truck cuts between THE CAMERA
and JUD.
INT. LOUIS, IN THE LIVING ROOM NIGHT
He's on the phone, smiling and happy.
RACHEL (voice)
You want to talk to the birthday girl?
LOUIS:
That'd be real fine.
ELLIE (voice)
Hi...daddy?
LOUIS (sings)
Happy birthday to you/Happy birthday
to you/Happy birthday, dear Ellie/Happy
birthday to you!
ELLIE (voice)
That was awful, daddy.
LOUIS:
Yeah, I know...how are things out
there in Chicagoland?
ELLIE:
Fine...except when Mom was airing
Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and
got into Grampa's study and pooped in
Grampa's favorite chair.

Page 53/68

LOUIS (grinning broadly)
Way to go, Gage!
ELLIE (voice)
What?
LOUIS:
I said that's too bad. What did you
get for presents from Gramma and Grampa?
ELLIE (voice)
Lots of stuff! I got two dresses...and
a Chatty Cathy doll...
INT. THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM, WITH ELLIE
She's dressed for bed, in fuzzy pink pajamas. Her Chatty Cathy is
crooked in one arm. In her lap is a Garfield transistor radio.
ELLIE:
...and a Garfield radio! How's Church,
dad? Does he miss me?
INT. THE CREED LIVING ROOM, WITH LOUIS
The smile fades off his face. It's replaced with a look of
combined guilt and unhappiness. He's looking at his hands, which
are still dark with the dirt from CHURCH'S grave.
LOUIS:
Well...I guess he's just fine, Ellie.
I haven't seen him this evening, but--
INT. THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM, WITH ELLIE
RACHEL, holding GAGE, sits on the arm of ELLIE'S chair.
ELLIE:
Well, make sure you put him down
cellar before you go to bed so he
can't run out in the road and get
greased. And kiss him goodnight for me.
LOUIS (voice)
Yuck! Kiss your own cat!
ELLIE:
Want to talk to Gage?
Before he can answer, she puts the phone in GAGE'S hand. ELLIE and
RACHEL watch, amused, as GAGE gobbles into it. Perhaps RACHEL
encourages him to say a few words.
INT. THE CREED LVING ROOM, WITH LOUIS
From the telephone comes the sound of GAGE talking and chortling.

Page 54/68

LOUIS is not listening. His eyes--and his mind--are far away.
EXT. THE CREED HOUSE MORNING
LOUIS is raking leaves on the side lawn, near the tree with the
tire swing. After a moment or two of this he props the rake
against the tree and starts toward the garage. He goes in.
EXT. THE GARAGE, WITH LOUIS
It's dim in here. LOUIS is crossing to the door which communicates
to the kitchen. As he passes the station wagon, he hears a cat
HISS. He turns.
INT. CHURCH, ECU
He's on top of the car, but at this point we probably don't
notice; THE CAMERA is so close that CHURCH looks like he's coming
right down our throats. He's hissing angrily.
INT. LOUIS
He recoils and stumbles backward with a cry. He hits a tool-rack
on the wall and a lot of them fall down with a LOUD JANGLING
NOISE.
INT. ON TOP OF THE STATION WAGON, WITH CHURCH
He jumps down, frightened by the noise, and the CAMERA TRACKS as
he goes flying out the garage door into the sunlight.
INT. LOUIS
He gets slowly to his feet again. He's getting over his fright but
we can see he's totally freaked out by what gave him that fright.
He goes to the garage door and looks out.
LOUIS (calls)
Church?
EXT. THE SIDE YARD, LOUIS'S POV
Grass and fallen leaves. No sign of CHURCH.
EXT. LOUIS'S STUNNED FACE, CU
INT. THE KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS
He's spooning cat-food into a dish. He goes to the door--there
should be a total of three doors in the kitchen: one to the living
room, one to the shed/garage, and one which leads directly
outside. LOUIS uses this latter door now.
EXT. THE KITCHEN STOOP, WITH LOUIS
He puts the dish of food down and sits beside it.
LOUIS:
Food, Church...food!
SOUND:
EXT. THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE, LOUIS'S POV
CHURCH comes slinking out of the bushes and comes slowly toward
THE CAMERA. He stops, looking mistrustful.

Page 55/68

EXT. LOUIS
LOUIS:
Come on, Church! Chow down!
EXT. CHURCH
He crosses to the stoop and begins eating the food.
LOUIS (to himself)
Christ. I don't believe this.
He picks CHURCH up. CHURCH miaows again--he wants the food.
LOUIS (wincing)
God, you stink, Church.
CHURCH is looking at the food, trying to get out of LOUIS'S arms.
LOUIS:
In a second.
He tilts the cat's head back so he can get a look at CHURCH'S
neck.
EXT. CHURCH'S NECK, CU (LOUIS'S POV)
There's some sort of mark here--a clear remnantof the crash. A
line of white fur, or perhaps a dark red scar where no fur at all
grows.
EXT. LOUIS AND CHURCH, ON THE STOOP
LOUIS sees something else as he lets the cat's neck go. He tweezes
something out of CHURCH'S whiskers.
EXT. LOUIS'S HAND, ECU
It's a shred of green plastic.
EXT. LOUIS AND CHURCH
LOUIS:
Chewed his way out. Jesus Baldheaded
Christ, he ch--
CHURCH suddenly claws at his face.
LOUIS:
Ow!
He claps his hand to his face. CHURCH leaps for the food. LOUIS
slowly takes his hand away. There are claw marks on his cheek,
welling blood. He looks at the cat.
EXT. JUD CRANDALL'S GARDEN, WITH JUD
The garden is a plot of about half an acre. JUD comes trundling
slowly along a row, pushing a wheelbarrow. There are several
pumpkins in it. JUD is wearing old khaki gardening pants and a
Ramones sweatshirt. He's wearing his headphones and we can hear
the Romantics doing "What I Like About You." JUD is singing along

Page 56/68

and bopping a little--as much as his arthritis will allow, if you
can dig it.
He sees a real big pumpkin, stops, and bends over to get it.
He takes out his pocket-knife and slits the pumpkin-vine. He gets
the pumpkin in his arms and stands up. He turns...and LOUIS is
right there (kind of a cheap jump, but always fun), looking
totally stunned.
JUD, startled, drops the pumpkin. LOUIS reaches out and slides the
phones off JUD'S ears.
LOUIS:
What did we do?
INT. THE CRANDALL KITCHEN
LOUIS is sitting at the kitchen table. JUD is at the fridge. JUD
comes back with a couple of long-necked bottles of beer and opens
them.
JUD:
I most generally don't start before
noon, but this looks like an exception.
LOUIS:
What did we do, Jud?
JUD:
Why, saved a little girl from being
unhappy...that's all. Drink up, Louis!
LOUIS drinks about half the beer.
LOUIS:
I tried to tell myself I buried him
alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets
Felix the Cat. But...
JUD:
Wouldn't wash?
LOUIS:
No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I
see it, and Church was dead. He smells
horrible and he uses his claws, but
he's alive...and I feel like I'm going
crazy. It was that place, wasn't it?

Page 57/68

JUD:
Ayuh. It was the rag-man told me about
the place--Stanley Bouchard. Us kids
just called him Stanny B. He was half
Micmac himself.
LOUIS drains his beer.
LOUIS:
Can I have another one?
JUD:
I guess it wouldn't hurt.
He gets up and goes to the fridge.
INT. JUD, AT THE FRIDGE
JUD:
The Micmacs used to bury their dead
up there long before the whites came.
He returns to the table with the beer.
JUD:
They buried their dead and for a long
time their dead stayed buried. Then
something happened. Half the tribe died
in a season. The rest moved on. They
said a Wendigo had soured the ground.
LOUIS:
Wendigo?
JUD:
Spirit of the north country. Not a good
spirit. Wendigos are great liars and
tricksters, according to the stories.
And if one touches you...
JUD pauses, perhaps a flustered, and gathers his thoughts.
JUD:
Maybe it really was a Wendigo--
I ain't the one to say it wasn't--
or maybe it was just some disease.
Whatever the reason, those that were
left moved on. But they left that
place...the way it is now.

Page 58/68

JUD shrugs, and drinks.
EXT. JUD AS A BOY, CU/SEPIA TONE DAY
The time here is about 1910. JUD is wearing short pants. He's
crying, not in any big-deal histrionic way, but as if he means to
keep doing it for a long time. I mean he looks really sad.
JUD (voice)
I loved my dog a lot, Louis. When Spot
died, I thought I was gonna die.
JUD is sitting on the front stoop. It's the same house JUD lives
in now, but the porch hasn't been added yet, and the road is dirt
rather than tar.
Along this road comes a horse-drawn wagon--STANNY B.'S wagon. The
wagon's full of junk, rags, bottles...stuff to sell and swap.
Strung across the top are bells, and we can hear their CHIMING
SOUND...but faint, like bells heard in a dream.
STANNY B. is old and drunk. Dust spumes up behind the wagon as he
draws up to the CRANDALL house and stops. He gets down, almost
falls, takes a bottle out of his back pocket, drinks, and
approaches JUD. We can see him speaking.
INT. JUD'S KITCHEN, WITH JUD AND LOUIS
LOUIS:
You and this old Indian rag-man--
JUD:
Stanny B. did for me what I did for
you last night, Louis. Only I wasn't
alone when Spot came back.
EXT. THE CRANDALL BACK YARD/SEPIA TONE DAY
JUD'S MOTHER is back to THE CAMERA, hanging sheets on the line.
The sheets billow. And suddenly, pushing out from behind them,
quite near her, is a small mongrel dog. SPOT. He's covered with
graveyard dirt. His eyes are red and rolling. He splashes the
sheets with the muck of his passage.
JUD (voice)
My mother was with me.
She sees who it is--what it is--and backs away, screaming,
horrified.
EXT. SPOT, CLOSER/SEPIA
JUD (voice)
He'd got caught in bobwire that infected.
You could still see the marks on him.
And so we can, around his neck and along the side of his head.
These marks are the counterpart of the marks we've already seen on

Page 59/68

CHURCH.
SOUND of JUD'S MOM SCREAMING. Like the bells, these are screams
heard in a dream.
EXT. THE BACK STOOP OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE/SEPIA
The BOY JUD comes running out, dressed in a night-shirt.
EXT. JUD'S MOM/SEPIA (JUD'S POV)
She's cringing against the fence at the rear of the yard. SPOT
stands in front of her, swaying from side to side, as if doped.
JUD'S MOM (dim; far)
Get your dog, Jud! He stinks of the
ground you buried him in! Come here
and get your dog!
She is in utter terror.
EXT. THE BOY JUD/SEPIA
Horrified...ashamed.
EXT. JUD'S MOM/SEPIA
JUD'S MOM (terror)
COME AND GET YOUR DOG!!
INT. JUD AND LOUIS, IN JUD'S KITCHEN
LOUIS:
How did your mother take it, Jud?
How did she take it when your dog
came back from the dead?
JUD'S face is a complication. He's lying to LOUIS, certainly--but
is he also lying to himself? Yes, I think so.
JUD:
Well, she was a little upset at first,
and that's why I thought you ought to
hold your peace when you talked to
your people last night...you did, didn't
you, Louis?
LOUIS:
Yes.
JUD:
Why, then, things should be fine.
LOUIS:
A little upset is all she was? Because
I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a
little like a nuclear reactor on the

Page 60/68

edge of a meltdown.
JUD:
She got used to the idea. Spot lived
another four years. He died peacefully
in the night that second time, and I
buried him in the Pet Sematary...where
his bones still lie.
EXT. THE ROAD BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES, WITH LOUIS AND JUD
We see them crossing.
LOUIS (voice)
You still haven't told me why you
did it.
EXT. JUD AND LOUIS, ON THE CREED FRONT LAWN
JUD:
A man doesn't always know why he does
things, Louis. I think I did it because
your daughter ain't ready for her
favorite pet to die.
LOUIS:
What?
JUD:
Ellie's a little scared of death. And
the main reason Ellie's that way is
because your wife is a lot scared of
death. Now you just go ahead and tell
me I'm wrong.
But LOUIS'S reaction tells him he's not wrong--in fact, JUD has
hit the nail right on the head.
INT. BATHTUB FIXTURES, CU
LOUIS'S hands come into the frame and turn the spigots.
INT. THE BATHROOM, WITH LOUIS
He starts to undress, still looking troubled. We should notice
that the door behind him is firmly shut. The bathroom has no
windows.
INT. THE BATHTUB SPIGOTS
The hot water is steaming. LOUIS'S hands enter the frame and turn
off the faucets. SOUND of LOUIS climbing in.
INT. LOUIS IN THE TUB
A big sigh and an expression of exquisite pleasure. He relaxes in
the hot water. After a few moments he puts a wet washcloth over

Page 61/68

his face.
INT. BY THE KITCHEN SINK, WITH RACHEL
RACHEL:
Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give
the little girl her promise.
INT. THE KITCHEN TABLE
GAGE is in his high chair. ELLIE is at her place, crying. In
RACHEL'S place sits VICTOR PASCOW, bloody and wrecked. LOUIS sits
in his place. On the platter of bacon and scrambled eggs is
CHURCH'S mangled body.
PASCOW:
The door must not be opened. The
barrier must not be crossed.
LOUIS:
You don't understand--
INT. THE BATHTUB, WITH LOUIS
The washrag is slipping, but it still covers his face.
LOUIS (mutters)
--I'm a doctor.
INT. THE CREED KITCHEN TABLE
In attendance:
in the middle of the table, clotted with dirt and blood, eyes
staring, neck a gory mess of infected wounds, is SPOT. He's also
dotted with clots of scrambled egg and bits of bacon.
PASCOW:
Sometimes the dead do more than speak.
Remember, doc.
INT. RACHEL, AT THE KITCHEN SINK
RACHEL (with great force)
Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Promise me.
Promise me. Promise me.
INT. THE BATHTUB, WITH LOUIS
The washcloth has slipped enough so we can see his eyes are
closed--he's dozing.
LOUIS:
Promise...
INT. THE CREED KITCHEN TABLE
To LOUIS, ELLIE, PASCOW, GAGE, and the corpse of SPOT enters JUD,

Page 62/68

his eyes shocked and staring.
JUD (to LOUIS)
You do it for all the best reasons,
but that ain't why. You do it because
it gets hold of you...you do it
because you have to.
INT. LOUIS, IN THE BATHTUB, CU
The washrag has worked its way down to his mouth by now. His doze
is deepening; he's started to snore a little.
SOUND:
LOUIS opens his eyes. Looks puzzled. Looks down. Eyes widen in
shock.
INT. THE BATHWATER, LOUIS'S POV
A very large and very mangled dead rat floats in the bath,
actually brushing against LOUIS'S chest. Blood has begun to stain
the water.
INT. LOUIS
Turns his head, preparatory to leaping out.
INT. THE TOILET LID, WITH CHURCH
Its mouth yawns open. It hisses, showing bloodstained teeth.
INT. THE BATHROOM
LOUIS leaps from the tub. Grabs a towel and begins to rub himself
frantically. He's grossed out. The cat tries to arch against him
and he hits it. CHURCH falls to the floor, hissing.
LOUIS looks at the closed door.
LOUIS:
How the hell did you get in?
He may not know that, but he knows how it's going to get out. He
opens the door to the upstairs hall. If CHURCH doesn't go at once,
LOUIS helps it with his foot.
Then he looks down at:
INT. THE BATHTUB WITH BRER RAT, LOUIS'S POV
INT. LOUIS
Staring at the rat. Over this: THE SOUND OF JET ENGINES.
EXT. A DELTA 727
Its landing gear unfolds preparatory to touching down at Bangor
International Airport.
INT. A DEPLANING AREA DAY
Lots of people making their way up the jetway.
INT. LOUIS, OUTSIDE THE SECURITY POINT
He's looking anxiously for his people. In one hand he's got half a
dozen roses. His face lights up.

Page 63/68

INT. THE DEPLANING AREA, LOUIS'S POV
Here comes LOUIS'S family. ELLIE is a little ahead. RACHEL is
pushing GAGE in his stroller. ELLIE sees LOUIS and lights up.
ELLIE:
Daddy!
She runs for him.
INT. JUST OUTSIDE THE SECURITY POINT
ELLIE comes belting up to LOUIS, weaving among the deplanees like
a slalom skier. She leaps into his arms. LOUIS swings her
cheerfully.
LOUIS:
Hi, sugar!
She smacks him noisily. He smacks her back just as noisily.
ELLIE:
Daddy, is Church all right?
LOUIS'S face changes. All at once he's watchful.
LOUIS:
Yes...I guess so. He was sleeping
on the front porch when I left.
ELLIE:
Cause I had a bad dream about him.
I dreamed he got hit by a car and
you and Mr. Crandall buried him in
the Pet Sematary.
LOUIS (trying to smile)
That was a silly dream, wasn't it?
ELLIE:
Is he really all right?
LOUIS:
Yes.
ELLIE:
Because you promised.
LOUIS:
I know.
RACHEL reaches them. She's pretty tired. Hair hanging in her face,

Page 64/68

good travelling clothes now looking a bit wrinkled and a bit
stale.
RACHEL:
Want to take your son, doc?
LOUIS does. GAGE is ecstatic.
LOUIS kisses RACHEL deeply.
INT. THE CREED KITCHEN, NIGHT
CHURCH at the door, waiting to be let out. ELLIE does the honors.
CHURCH oils out into the shed/garage. ELLIE closes the door. She
looks distressed. She crosses the kitchen again.
INT. THE CREED LIVING ROOM, NIGHT
RACHEL, in a flannel nightgown, is watching TV. LOUIS is reading a
medical tome and making notes. GAGE, zipped into a warm blanket
suit, is sacking on the couch.
ELLIE (entering)
Can cats have shampoos?
RACHEL:
Yes--you have to take them to someone
who grooms animals, though. I think
it's pretty expensive.
ELLIE (still upset)
I don't care. I'll save up my allowance
and pay for it. Church smells bad.
LOUIS:
I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up
the money, Ellen.
ELLIE:
I hate that smell.
INT. LOUIS, CU
He looks both grim and sad--a man discovering that what you pay
for you own, and what you own always comes home to you.
LOUIS:
Yes--I hate it, too.
BLACK. And on it, a fourth title card: MISSY DANDRIDGE.
SOUND:
INT. A STUDY DESK, CU
A single sheet of lined paper is spotlighted by the glow of the
desk-lamp. On it, MISSY'S right hand is just finishing: "Dr. says

Page 65/68

Intestinal Cancer. Cannot face this Pain. Sorry."
The hand puts the pen down. It tears the paper in two, leaving
just the half with the message.
INT. THE DANDRIDGE CELLAR, NIGHT
A light comes on and we see a hangman's noose strung over a beam.
It dangles above a kitchen table which has been relegated to
cellar duty.
SOUND:
INT. THE NOOSE, CU
SOUND of MISSY climbing onto the table.
Her face enters the frame. She looks very sick. She puts her head
into the noose and rakes it tight at the hyoid bone.
EXT. THE DANDRIDGE HOUSE, NIGHT
One light on...a cellar light.
SOUND:
SOUND:
SOUND:
INT. THE CELLAR, WITH MISSY DANDRIDGE
She hangs limply, hands dangling at her sides, above the table,
which now lies upon its side. We can see the note clearly. She
pinned it to the bodice of her housedress.
SOUND:
EXT. IN FRONT OF THE GRACE METHODIST CHURCH DAY
People are coming out and getting into their cars and turning on
the headlights, even though it is only mid-morning.
In the immediate f.g. is a hearse. Four pallbearers are loading a
coffin into it.
EXT. LOUIS AND ELLIE, ON THE CHURCH STEPS
ELLIE:
They're all turning on their lights!
Daddy, why are they all turning on
their lights in the middle of the day?
JUD, dressed in a rusty old black suit and a black tie, comes out
and stands with them. He looks haggard and old.
JUD:
They do it to honor the dead, Ellen.

Page 66/68

ELLIE:
Is that right, dad?
LOUIS:
Yes. To honor the dead.
EXT. THE CHURCH PARKING AREA
More cars start up; more lights come on; the back doors of the
hearse swing closed.
EXT. LUDLOW CEMETARY DAY
[NOTE:
because of a high iron fence. Here we should see there's no such
problem; there's only a low stone wall between the graveyard and
the public road.]
The mourners are of course gathered around the grave of MISSY
DANDRIDGE. The coffin rests above it on runners.
MINISTER (voice)
May the Lord bless you and keep you;
may the Lord make his face to shine
upon you, and comfort you, and lift
you up, and give you peace. Amen.
EXT. LOUIS, ELLIE, JUD
As the mourners begin to break up, these three start back toward
LOUIS'S car.
JUD:
Rachel not feeling well?
LOUIS:
Well...a touch of the flu...
ELLIE:
She's in bed. She was throwing up.
Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said
Missy--
LOUIS:
That's enough, Ellen.
They've reached the CREED station wagon.
JUD:
Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.
LOUIS:

Page 67/68

This babe has said enough.
He opens the front passenger door.
LOUIS:
Hop in, Ellie.
She does, and LOUIS closes the door.
JUD:
Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to
hear. I remember when she was
no older'n Ellen there, walking down
to the store with her Raggedy Anne
doll draggin' behind her in the dust.
I don't know why God takes someone
like her, who should have a bunch of
years still in front of them, and lets
an old shit like me just go on and on.
LOUIS:
My father used to have a saying, Jud--
"God sees the truth, but waits."
JUD:
Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
LOUIS:
It's Ellie's cat.
JUD:
Nope. He's your cat now.
JUD opens one of the back doors as LOUIS goes around to the
driver's side.
INT. THE BACK SEAT OF THE WAGON
JUD has tilted over in one corner and is snoring. His Walkman
'phones are on and we can hear the tinny sounds of Billy Idol. A
little old man's drool trickles down from one corner of his mouth.
SOUND:
