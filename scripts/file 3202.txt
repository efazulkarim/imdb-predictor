Like this?

Good.

Okay, that's good.

Right?

Hey, hey, guys.

Yay!

Here goes.

- Hey, Gordon.

- You're late.

Two whole minutes.

Sweet threads.

Is that Aeropostale?

I see you're still sporting

your attire from age 12.

Whatever.

After you.

God.

I remember this place

feeling so big.

Yeah, you said it.

Shall we start boxing up?

Yeah, sure.

Let's get this over with.

Hey.

What if he's okay?

What do you mean?

I mean, not dead.

It's been seven months.

If he's out there,

it's not our problem anymore

Nobody else is gonna

clean up this mess. Come on.

Alright.

Oh, my God.

Is this amusing you?

Oh, dude,

remember these things?

VCR games?

Vaguely.

Most of this junk

just blends together.

Oh, come on, you know,

it's like you put in the tape

and they make you

turn off the lights--

then you gotta get close

to the TV

and they scream at you. Yeah.

Ridiculous.

We loved it.

Oh, my God, check it out!

It's that Indiana Jones

rip-off game.

What a goofy piece of sh*t

this was.

Hey, what are you losers

doing in here? Huh?

- Derek?

- Huh..

I saw that stupid purple car outside.

I thought

someone was trying to break in.

How you doing, Gordy?

It's good to see you.

I wish it was under

a different circumstances.

Yeah, me too.

Johnny Boy,

staying out of trouble?

Of course, yeah.

I like your outfit, man.

It's very "Adam-12" of you.

Yeah, yeah, thanks.

It's a job.

Yeah. Look at this place.

Your dad really did a good job

keeping it up, huh?

Yeah, well, not much

could pull him out of here.

Hey, look, we kinda got a lot to do here.

I hope to give you a call

this weekend. That okay?

Of course, yeah.

Of course, of course.

Under one condition though.

You let me rent

Operation Orion."

I f***ing love this movie.

- Keep it.

- Ahem.

Really?

Sh*t, I didn't expect that.

It's the movie

that made me wanna be a cop.

- Yeah.

- Cool. Have a good one.

See you guys soon.

- It's a terrible movie.

- He's a terrible cop.

- See you later.

- See ya, Constable.

Hey, John.

What's up?

Do you have dad's keys

to the office?

Uh...Negative.

Why?

What do you think is back there?

I don't know.

Guess I'll find out.

I'm sure they're around here

somewhere.

Hey!

Who's that?

Is that your girlfriend?

What's her name?

- Margot.

- Hm.

And she is getting into town

as we speak.

- Should we wrap this up for now?

- Yeah.

I think I breathed in enough

dads skin cells for today.

Are you staying at dad's?

I think so.

She's staying with me.

You're not living there,

are you?

F***, no.

Jesus, that'd be creepy.

Yeah, I think

I'm gonna hang back here

put another dent in this place.

Hm. Thanks, John.

I appreciate that.

Yeah, sure. Later.

- Uh, see you tomorrow.

- See ya.

Hey, Babe.

Oh, sh*t.

What happened here?

Well, it toppled over

a minute ago.

John must have left

a window open.

Long flight?

Yeah, and then the driver

couldn't find this place, so..

- Everything cool?

- Yeah.

- What is that smell?

- Nothing.

Air conditioning vents must need

cleaning out or something.

So no one's been here?

Oh, no way.

Dad stopped stocking up

on friends

since before I was in middle school.

Damn.

Bob was staying analog, huh?

Dad didn't have

a lot of faith in the DVD boom.

A lot of wood.

Oh.

And who's this dork

with the buck teeth?

- That stud you mean?

- Hm.

That was me, the year I won

our middle school

track-and-field competition.

You were on the track team?

Javelin.

So are you hungry?

Starving, but every place around here

will probably give you

food poisoning.

Really?

What about that bar

with the weird name

Sterling Sal or something?

Uh, are you sure

you don't just want me

to cook something here?

Let's go. Show me the town.

Taking a really long time, huh?

-Slow service.

- Yeah.

Oh, damn it.

Do you know them?

Yup. That's my brother.

Oh, sh*t, Gordon.

Oh, what's up, my man?

How you doing?

- Is this your girlfriend?

- Yup.

Margot,

this is my brother, John.

Oh, nice to meet you.

I've heard a lot about you.

For real?

He's talked about me?

- That's shocking.

- Occasionally.

- Bring it in.

- Its good to meet you.

Maybe I'll get my hugs too.

Hi, I'm Hank.

Yeah, this is, uh,

this is my friend, Hank.

I'm Gordon.

Yeah, I heard.

But, yeah, take a seat.

Why, you are something else.

Well, hello, Dahlia.

How are you, gorgeous?

You again.

Uh, let's do, like

four vodka sodas all around.

Gordon's buying, so--

- Excuse me?

- I'll get it.

Oh, yeah, just bring

an extra one for this guy.

He's a little bit of a...

I'm fine. Make it three.

- For real?

- Ah.

Yeah, I'm not drinking anymore.

Did you get a DUI

or something?

No.

So...

Gordon, how you been?

What's up?

What's been going on?

Must be something interesting

if you can't help out

your brother, huh?

Well, that's obviously

your business.

Well, see,

it is if I have to step up

to home plate for you,

sweet thing.

Dude, chill.

I'm just saying

what needs to be said, brah.

Yeah, uh, I can take care

of myself. Thanks, man.

You're all good.

- Hm.

- I think we should just go.

Yeah, you should probably

just go.

Hank, enjoy your next stint

in county jail.

Thank you, and feel free

to go f*** yourself, sweetheart.

- Wanna say that again?

- He's just trying

to get a rise out of you.

John, it was nice to meet you, come by the house sometime.

So good to meet you, too.

I'll, I'll see ya.

John, we'll see you tomorrow.

Hank.

- Well, that went well.

- That was f***ing awful.

Ah, drinks!

Thank you, Dahlia.

Hey.

Everything okay?

Yeah. I got it.

What's wrong?

What do you mean?

You're just acting weird.

You did great

with that creep back there.

Hey, Gordon, talk to me.

I know you think

you need to protect yourself

from everyone and everything

but you don't have to do that

with me.

That was a huge improvement.

Well, thanks.

Uh, it justbrought up

a lot of stuff

that I didn't want to remember.

You know, I,

you know, I've already f***ed up

so much between us.

You did f*** things up

but the only way

we're gonna get through it

is through time and commitment.

I love you for the man

that I know you are.

I just don't wanna end up

some drunk weirdo

with an irrelevant video store.

Well, as long as I'm around,

that's not happening.

Hm, Gordon.

Gordon.

I just took an Ambien.

You wanna have, Ambien sex?

Yeah.

Well, before I pass out.

Uh, tomorrow?

Well, not in his bed.

Fine.

Goodnight.

Goodnight.

Why are you so chipper?

You know, I'm just workin'.

Hey, did you try to get

into the house last night?

Dude, I have the keys.

Why would I do that?

- What about that Hank creep?

- No, man.

He lives, like,

way out in the boonies.

Why, did someone

try and break in?

Thought I heard someone

messing around with the window.

Felt like somebody was watching us.

Yeah, man,

it was probably some meth-head

trying to steal dad's stuff.

The whole neighborhood

has gone to sh*t.

It's for the birds.Hey, why do you hang out

with that scumbag, anyway?

Well, um, that scumbag is my friend.

I mean, he might not be

the independently wealthy

stuffed shirt you are

but I mean, at least he was

around when dad disappeared.

You know,

that whole disappearance thing

it loses a lot of weight

when it's the 40th time

dad splits town

and cuts off communication.

Whatever.

I have a mortgage to pay, John.

Hank dropped everything

when I called him.

Hey.

Check out...

...what I found.

Ooh.

Do you wanna...

- Maybe we should, right?

- Yeah.

Ooh. This is momentous.

- Shut up.

- Hm.

Hm. So this is it.

It's, like,

exactly how I'd pictured it.

Really?

I always thought

it'd be bigger, for some reason.

Hey, you know what else

I always pictured?

What?

Comin' back here and going

through all of this sh*t.

Hey, there's gotta be

some weird stuff back here.

- Kind of afraid to be honest.

- Oh, don't be a puss.

- See anything interesting?

- Uh-uh.

Keep your fingers crossed.

Whoa!

- Holy sh*t!

- This is some serious firepower--

whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey!

Look out, Bickle,

don't point that thing at me.

Jesus, what the hell

did dad have that for?

Probably to shoot stuff.

Huh.

What do we have here?

Hm.

"Beyond the Gates."

Huh.

Looks like somebody

was playing it recently.

Oh, sh*t.

I wonder why he brought that back here.

Maybe it has something on it

he doesn't want anybody to see.

Then we should watch it.

Uh, maybe we shouldn't.

Oh, come on, man,

aren't you curious

what dad was watching

the last time he was back here?

I mean, maybe it's not even

the tape from the game.

Maybe that's just the label,

maybe...

What if it's a sex tape?

That's even worse.

Do you really wanna see

dad having sex with mom?

I mean, who knows, man,

it could be your first home video.

Oh, John. i/

Welcome, curious viewers. i/

Are you ready to step

into the ultimate nightmare? i/

A world of unimaginable horror i/

with deadly consequences. i/

Have you the courage

to go Beyond the Gates? i/

You may now open

your game board. i/

Dude, turn it off,

turn it off.

What was that?

Why the hell

was he keeping that back here?

I think because it causes seizures?

Or because that lady

was f***ing smoking hot.

I think I want it.

Well, it's, it's yours now.

- How long were we in there?

- I have no idea.

Oh, sh*t, it's 5:00 already.

Really?

What are you doing for dinner?

Oh, are you, you gonna

invite me over to dinner

'cause you don't want

your girlfriend to yell at you

'cause you're late?

Yes.

I don't know, it's tough

'cause it's like McDonald's

or roll the dice

on the G-man's home cooking.

I don't know.

You'll be happy to know

that Margot's the one

handling food tonight.

Alright, yeah, you're on.

- See you at the house.

- Yeah, see ya.

Somebody's hungry.

I know, yeah.

This is, this is delicious.

- Oh, thanks.

- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

So your friend was interesting.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah, he can get

pretty riled up sometimes.

Don't tell me you go

pick up girls with that guy.

What?

What, he's not that bad.

I'm pretty sure

he's a date rapist.

So, John,

what do you do for work?

Oh, you know,

just like, uh, odd jobs

and helping out, uh

with errands and things

for people.

Well, like a, like an assistant?

Yeah, exactly.

Um, so how was

your first night here?

Oh, my God.

I haven't slept that well

in months.

Really?

I didn't stumble out of bed

once. It's great.

What do you mean,

like, sleepwalking?

Well, ahem,

she's been taking Ambien

to keep her down at night

with mixed results.

- Really?

- Yeah.

I was having nightmares

after I hurt my wrists

so the doctor

prescribed it to me.

After you hurt your, what?

How did that happen?

I fell.

So how was, um,

the store today?

It was good, you know, we, uh

we, we found this, like

weird, probably banned VCR game.

What's a VCR game?

It's like a,

it's like a board game, you know

but you gotta watch it.

There are, like, a bunch of them.

There's Gatekeeper"

and Nightmare"

and, like,

a bunch of adventure ones.

I don't know, there's, like,

way too many to name

but here, check it out.

Wow!

The designer

clearly did not study semiotics.

Mm-hmm.

Wait, what's that?

Oh, it's, um,

just full of clashing symbols.

Well, it's really old

and seizure inducing.

Shut up.

Let's play it.

- Yeah?

- Right now?

- Yeah.

- Okay.

Come on.

It'll be fun.

Okay.

Alright, so we gotta

get the tape in there.

Okay, here's the board.

I'll put the tape in.

Whoa! Who's the babe?

Oh, sh -- she said

something about

opening up the game board earlier.

The blue, grey

and red players i/

place your pieces

on the starting point. i/

I'll go for grey. i/

I'll be red.

I guess I will be blue.

The blue player i/

you may now

step in front of the screen. i/

Do it.

To collect the keys

and unlock the gateway i/

a series of challenges

must be undertaken. i/

Failure to do so

will turn your souls i/

over to our world. i/

Okay, there's supposed to be

some sort of goal or something?

I have no idea.

Obtaining the four keys i/

allows passage beyond the gates i/

and a return to your world. i/

Only there

can your father's soul be saved. i/

What the f***?

Did you just hear that?

The other world awaits you. i/

Where did you say

you found this again?

Our dad's office.

Could it be

some sort of prank?

If it is,

it's not very funny.

You know,

we should show this to someone.

Wait. Maybe Derek could help.

You think he'd do that?

Can't hurt to ask.

You guys, I'm getting

a really bad energy off of this.

Do you mind if I go upstairs?

No, no.

I'll take care of the dishes.

Thank you.

Oh, hey, you know what?

Let me help you out with those.

Sure, that'd be great.

Thanks.

Do you need money or something?

No.

Just maybe, like, a place to

crash for a couple of days.

Hey, you're homeless?

Oh, wow, uh.. nn..

Well, I had something

going on for a while

uh, with, uh, someone,

but she turned out to..

I, I don't anymore, so..

So let me guess.

This is an indefinite stay

until you get your own place?

Uh, yeah, pretty much. Yeah.

Well...

Tell you what? Do these

and you got yourself a deal.

Yeah, I'm doing 'em.

Hey, um...

Yeah, what's up?

I don't know.

Do you really think that tape

has something to do with dad?

It seems that way.

Sh*t.

I wonder if officer Derek's

ever dealt with anything

like this.

I'm sure he's handled

much more weirder cases.

Oh, yeah.

Hey, uh,

be sure to lock the door.

Yeah, sure thing.

Dad would kill me

if he found it open.

- What?

- Sorry.

Oh, that was a, uh..

Yeah.

Yeah.

Hm.

Ahem. Have a good night.

Yeah, you too.

Goodnight.

Dad?

Help me.

Holy sh*t!

- Jesus. Hey.

- Uh.

- Hey.

- Ah..

What happened?

You were sleepwalking.

Oh. Hey, guys, I really think

someone was in here.

- What?

- Hey.

- Is everything okay?

- Yeah. Uh..

What are you doing down here?

I thought I heard something movin' around.This was on the mantle.

- Did you remember

to lock the door?

- Yeah.

Hey, man.

Thanks for coming out.

How are ya?

Well, honestly, I've been better.

Listen, I'm still on the clock,

I don't have a lot of time

so if we could go pretty quick here.

- Hey, John.

- Officer.

- You must be Margot.

Nice to meet you.i/

You too.

- Right, so, uh, this is it.

- Yeah.

Let's take a look at this thing.

There was some

really weird sh*t on there

when we watched--

Where did you say

you found this again?

Our dad's back office.

Well, for future reference,

you might not wanna get

your fingerprints all over it.

That's besides the point now

I guess. Pop it in.

That's her.

Hm?

It's just

a bunch of wavy static.

What?

Dude, she's right there.

The blond lady

with the big eyes

staring out at us?

Are you kidding?

Okay. Okay.

It's a great joke, guys.

Had a shitty night,

but that's a great joke.

It's not a joke.

Look, uh, maybe you need

to take a break from this

for a while.

Take yourself

on a small vacation.

Just call me

if you find anything else.

Wait, wait.

H-how how's that possible?

How is that possible? I mean,

you saw that, right, Margot?

Yes, of course.

What was the last thing

she said?

The, the four keys await us

or something.

Well, there's four keys

on the board.

She wants us

to play the game. i/

It's f***ing unbelievable

as that sounds.

I don't think

we've got any other choice.

Okay, so how do we play?

Where's the first key?

The location of the first key i/

will be found on the board. i/

Okay, that's us.

Um, maybe

there's a, a hint in here

or some-- something.

Yeah, well, X marks the spot.

Did you see that?

I think you pissed it off.

Well, look in the box,

maybe there's something else

in here.

Check out that knife.i/

Oh, sh*t,

that's dad's signature.

The Spiral Staircase.

Is that place still open?

Good morning.

How may I assist you?

Uh, we think our father

bought this from your store

a few years ago.

- "Robert Hardesty. 1991."

Well, I'm afraid it's a little

late to make a return.

We were wondering

if you knew where it came from.

That's of no consequence

to either of you.

I trust you've played the tape?

We have.

Then I suggest

you play the game.

Wow!

Where do we find the keys? i/

Only the game

has the answers you seek. i/

You're insane.

Come on, let's get out of here.

Hes

- Hey, what's that?

- Oh, yes.

This is my pet, Herbert.

Hey. Look what I got.

Boom.

I had to.

I can't believe

you did that.

I...

...don't think she likes that.

Yeah, it doesn't

look like it.

A wise man

would read the instructions.i/

Uh, what?

To initiate your fate

roll the dice.i/

The number played

will dictate guidancei/

for your next action.i/

Snake eyes.

Flip over the first card.i/

The Drifter.

Opening his poisoned organs

will reveal the first key.

That looks like our backyard.

Whoa.

There.

Oh, sh*t.

What are you doing here?

Well, I decided

to play hooky from school.

So I thought

I'd come on down here

and visit you, darlin'.

- You got a job now?

- You know me.

Always got a few things

on the line.

What the f*** is that?

Go on, say it.

Say it.

You miss me.

Right?

No.

No.

I'm on a break,

so I wanna be left alone.

Ah, wait, wait, wait.

Come here, come here, come here.

Come here.

Nothin'?

Nothin'.

Don't turn

your f***ing back on me, b*tch.

Is there anything else

in there?

No. Let me see that.

I think something's in here.

- It's metal.

- A key?

Maybe.

Do you need scissors

or anything?

No, man.

- Ah..

- Hank?

What the f*** is that?

- Ah..

- Oh, my God!

- Hello?

- Hey, man.

How you holdin' up?

Not well.

Come on, John.

I mean, some crazy girl

kills her cheating ex-boyfriend

it's not on you.

Guess we should

give it a try, right?

Wow.

No way.

Uh-oh.

Was this always here?

No.

This is freaking me out.

Where the hell

did this come from?

Margot.

Don't, don't,

don't mess with that.

What was that?

Let's get

the f*** outta here.

I am not flipping those over.

F*** it, I'll flip it over.

No, wait.

What if we just stopped?

I'm not gonna stop

until we find dad.

John.

We don't know

if that's your dad in there.

What is it?

F***.

What do the rest

of these mean?

I don't know.

I have a feeling

we can't stop this thing

if we wanted to right now.

I don't want you

staying here any longer.

In the house?

Yeah, but..

I don't want you around here

while we're messing

with this stuff.

It's making me very nervous.

Well, if you're

sleeping here, I am too.

Fine.

I'm gonna go upstairs.

Goodnight, John.

Why are you being

such a dick to her?

I don't wanna

freak her out anymore.

Hmm.

Are you sure she's the one

that's freaked out?

I think we should

stop messing with this.

I don't wanna

provoke it any further.

Yeah, whatever, man.

I'm gonna hit the hay.

Gordon.

Margot! Margot!

Margot, wake up!

Wake up!

Oh!

Jesus Christ.

John.

Did you leave this on?

Dad finished the game.

Come again?

That's how they got him.

Well done.i/

You've acquired the first key.i/

Have you the courage

to obtain the second?i/

F*** this.

No way, let's hear her out.i/

How do we get it?

With The Noble One possessedi/

by the forces of the world.i/

He will arrive knowing his fatei/

and be cast as the enemy.i/

The key will be located

within his mind.i/

Requiring a choice

of life and death.i/

What does she mean by that?

Mm.

Mm, we can figure it out

out here.

Hmph.

I can take a guess

who that is.

Margot.

Your powers of deduction

serve you well.

Uh, that's it.

I'm not risking her life

over this.

Excuse me.

Well, hello, Fair Maiden.

Yeah. Um, are you

the owner of this place?

Oh, yes, indeed.

I think my boyfriend was here

a couple of days ago.

Dark hair, glasses.

Oh, yes,

the short-tempered fellow.

I suppose.

Um, this is gonna sound

f***ing crazy

but we think a game

killed a friend of ours.

I don't have another way

to explain--

Once the game begins,

only two paths exist.

Completion and death.

Can you tell me

anything else about the game?

Mm, very little I'm afraid.

Only a scant number

have played it

but, uh, every few years or so,

it always ends up back here.

Uh, why do they return it?

They don't.

Has anyone ever

beaten the game?

Never.

But that doesn't mean

you should stop trying.

Unfortunately,

I can guide you no further.

Hah, if you're

the religious type

I might consider an appeal

to a higher power.

Huh.

- Remember this one?

- Ah, yes.

The old castration

by boat propeller scene.

Video nasty, classic.

You expecting someone?

I hope not.

Gordon!i/

It's Derek.

Oh, sh*t!

- What the f*** is he doing?

- I don't know.

Gordon.

Oh, no.

Oh.

Uh.

You did that.

Ah.

He's not joining us?

No, I think

he wants to be alone.

Sounds familiar.

What was it like

to grow up here?

Oof. Um..

Maybe he should tell you

about that.

Well, I'm asking you

and I've been feeding you all week

so maybe you should tell me.

Well, well, that's-- that's fair enough.

Um..

...it's kinda hard to summarize

but, uh, our dad..

...he was a-- he was

a pretty good guy

up until mom's car accident.

Uh, I mean he-- he was

always a drinker

but I think that kinda

pushed him over the edge.

Yeah, we just both kinda lived with it.

Um... Kept working at the store

for a few years as kids

and just, you know,

tried not to piss him off.

Then... Gordon finally split

and then things got

a lot worse for dad.

Wow.

I didn't know all that.

Gordon was a big drinker

when we met.

Why'd he stop?

He had a little too much

to drink one night.

We got in an argument

and he grabbed my wrists

a little too hard.

He was mortified.

Six weeks later,

my wrist healed

and he was off drinking

for good.

Hi.

Oh, hey, man, what's up?

How you feeling?

Not great.

I'm gonna go back upstairs.

Hey, wait, man.

Wait-- wait, man.

Wait. Look. Look.

We weren't trying to upset you.

I never should have

come back here.

- Yeah, well, you did.

And if we don't finish this,

you know what's gonna happen.

Hey.

What?

Be careful.

John!

Don't touch that again.

No problem.

John!

Holy sh*t!

What the f*** was that?

It-- it came

through the gate.

Have you seen Margot?

Well played, gentlemen.i/

Only two keys left.i/

Where is she?

As The Maiden crosses overi/
