Michel Vaillant By Luc Besson 
Page 1/24
For 25 years... 
There have been two teams... 
Fighting for championship 
on all circuits in the world: 
the "Vaillants" and... 
"the leader" 
the leader, No.13! 
Michel Vaillant... 
It's a incredible fight! 
70th Le Mans 24 hours race 
Michel Vaillant attacks! 
Collision! 
Another fierce collision between the two cars! 
Michel Vaillant is dead! 
Michel! 
Michel is in the flames! 
What happened, dear 
Calm down, it will be alright! 
Michel is healthy and well. Don't worry! 
Just like the real thing... 
Every time you have unpleasant dream, actually nothing happened Hum... 
Take it easy 
Excuse me 
Hello, Mom 
Listen to me, firstly, I won't attend Le Mans this year the car isn't ready 
Secondly, "The leader" has been racing for 5 years Mom, there is no No. "13" in Le Mans 
and never would be 
He has been standing for a hour, 
how come he is not frozen? 
Michel seldom freeze, 
Michel seldom smoke, Michel seldom drink 
Michel seldom sleep. 
No mom, I'm not angry, I love you, 
See you later 
Last year, in "Dakar" 
It's 155 Fahrenheit 
He has been sitting in the car for 3 hours 
while I talk to some guy on the "Camel" 
There he goes! 
I'll go get him, I can't believe 
we've stayed here for several hours! 
Page 2/24
All right! 
So what did chief said? 
The sea wind went strong for 2 monthes So? We're not go sailing, are we? 
Strike by sea wave 
And? 
Instead of having fresh water ice 
We got salt water ice. 
What's the diffenernt? We can not eat of it. Salt water ice breaks up stiff! 
50 right! Jet! Left! 
200 turn! 
Attention! backwater bend! 
Attention! 
50 long right! 
backwater bend! 150 
Right! 
Left, turn! 
Right! 300! 
Right? 
Beeline! Crossed! 
Hurry up! 
Now? 
That's it! 
Who is behind us? 
It's Michel 
What are you doing behind us? 
Because they made a ride 
on the froze lake 
And salty ice is really bad! 
What about you? 
Why do you dawdle? 
That bastard, Cramer! He is in front of us! He is blocking us! 
Let's have fun! 
"Jet" 
May I? 
Oh, yes, sir! 
What shall we do next? 
Control, 1000! 
My right hand side! 
left hand side! 
Yes, sir! 
Get out of here! 
Page 3/24

Get out of here! 
Let's go! Giulio! 
You first! 
Bastards! 
You bastards! 
Sorry, we don't understand french 
Sir, clean window for you? 
Steve, can you open the window, I feel sick 
How can you be sick on 2 miles an hour. 
Your speed is alright 
But your perfume. Haha! 
Very clever! I really do not stink then 
Who said gas smell bad? 
Go early, arrive early! 
That will solve the problem 
Keep cool, man! 
What's the point to get there too early? 
Let them wait till the last second 
That makes "class" 
"Class" means getting there... 
Son of the bitch!... 
He's going to learn my name! 
How we suppose to take on time! 
Being late is the sign of "real class"? 
"class"? 
Is it good that you leave from garden city? 
Mr. President! 
How about smile for me! 
Natasha! Oh you shoot me! 
You know why I shoot 
Thank you! Enjoy yourself 
I'm fine now 
Your lumberjack goes 
to the same place we are 
"50th RALLY VAN CANADA" 
There they come! 
Gabrielle? 
Steve? It was you 
I thought It was a student driver... 
I hate "being late is question of 'class'" 
See you later! 
They are "The lumberjack" pretty prettier these days This is not over! 
Michel! Stern! I have reserved a table for you, but hurry up Page 4/24

Otherwise someone else will get that! Jos? Come on! 
Let's take a photo! 
No! I have a blood hackle at photographs! "laugh" 
I'm goona have the picture framed 
And I hang him on in the hall of Drawer Jonquie. Four against one! Cowards! 
Let's go, or they will pinch our table Come, David? 
Be right there, sir 
It's hard to knot 
It resembles nowhere. 
It's pretty awful. It's my wife does that. I absolutely lose without her 
Where is she? 
The rally of South-africa. 
She is 4th in general. 
Not bad! 
Especially with a car that do not get ahead. If she have a Vaillante she be the first! Damn it! Have to play it again! 
See you later! 
I'll be right there! 
May I help? 
Let me see! 
I am just like your wife, but not 
Get out of my way! 
Gabrielle Spangenberg! 
Sandra Svanson 
The 2nd place... 
Stern Warson and Giulio Cavallo! 
You are really sexy as you are scared! You will pay heavily for it! 
And then now... the winner of the 11th edition of our rally for the 2nd successive year... Michel Vaillant... 
And his pilot David Dougherty! 
Humble? How can I be any more humble? I like my best friends winner's pure humility! In fact, if you team up with me ... 
You will see how humble I could be. 
Are you a female wheel? What beloved! I'd love to have you as my co-driver 
Page 5/24
Actual that's not quite how my imagined things Oh really? How do you imagine? 
You know you are beautiful!

Good night 
Oh, Jesus! 
Oh? Are you ok! 
It hurts! 
I'm sorry! 
Just I can't stand! 
I'll take you to the hospital. 
The hospital? 
No, I hate hospitals! 
If I can go to your home and have a cup of whisky, maybe it will be fine, I don't know 
It's all wet! 
Jesus, why does always rain here 
So do bags... 
Everyone said: 
in Drawer Jonquie's home, welcome 
My eautiful Laura! 
You just keeping on growing! 
It's raining, I don't hear the car 
Long time no see 
It's wonderful to see you! Michel 
Here I am, mom! 
Here is the coffee for everyone 
Thank you, madam 
Michel, stop playing with your cousin 
Page 6/24
Listen to me! 
Thanks for your coming! 
This is important for me 
For I have 2 things I want to share with you. 
I have good news and... 
I also have the great news! 
The Good is that Peugeot called me 
today... 
and their famous motor "Evolution 5" 
is ready and has been promised to us! 
When shall we get them? 
It should be in May, but he is operational against half June I.e.... 
for Le Mans! 
The 70th Le Mans 24 hours race! 
That's good news, what's the great news? 
The great news is for David. 
You get a steering wheel for Italy, 
If you perform well, 
with Michel as a team for Le Mans 
Henri, do you mind I give you a hug? 
This is incredible! 
Henri! I don't know what to say... 
This is real the most wonderful day 
of my life! 
I swear I didn't know about this, mom. 
What's difference? 
Look it is not really the first time 
that we are gonna take in Le Mans. 
But it is well the first time 
that I dream so terribly 
We are being well in Le Mans, but there 
still no "the leader" or a no. 13. 
Mom, bless me! 
For David, it's a big day 
Julie, I wish you were there! 
YOu will be so proud of me! 
What? The weather? 
It's grand! 
And I am happiest man! 
What if I take a photograph of them! 
You were not even born, Natasha! 
I know that? 
I can dream, can't I? 
Page 7/24
Le Mans in memory of 70th... 
Let me introduce to you the latest car nations 
have known for more than 20 years 
"No.13" is the most expected team 
And they have Le Mans selected 
for their large return. 
I have it naturally over the team 
Of "the leader"! 
Our team manager, brave Gentleman Cheek 
Left us 5 years ago 
Beauty queen Ruth Cheek 
The daughter of the leader! 
She leads her team Malaca 
Many of you know my father, how stubborn he was 
Winning means everything for him. 
Be ensured, I am my father's daughter! 
Don't worry 
Really worry about it! 
Don't be afraid of your mom's nightmare 
"The leader" must take part in Le Mans. 
How is that? 
I hope that the young lady is 
more honest than her father is. 
Calm down! 
I'm quite calm! 
Besides, I am seeking here nothing. 
I have things to do! 
Dad, please! 
And then now, as we do in every year, we will proceed to auctions as the social works of Le Mans. 
A. 4,000 Euros for the gloves 
of Alain Prost. 
4,000, twice. Nobody? ... 
4,000, third... 
Awarded to the young lady! 
And then now a quite fine piece of 
the helmet of Juan Manuel Fangio 
Five world champions winner. 
An exceptional piece. first bid is at 5,000 Euros. 5,000 Euros? 
10000! beauty Queen. Cheek! 
10000! 
11000, Michel Vaillant... 
13000 once ... 14000 once 
Page 8/24
14000 twice, 
Michel Vaillant! 15000 going once 
Going twice? 
Anyone else bids? 
25000! beauty Queen. Cheek! 
25000, twice? 
Michel Vaillant! 
26000! 
26000, once? 
Twice? 
30000! beauty Queen. Cheek! 
Michel Vaillant 
How about it? 
No regret? 
Are you sure? 
Sold to Beauty queen. Cheek! 
And then we'll continue to pieces no. 43. The famous Michel Vaillant 
Le Mans is not begun yet 
And you're already losing. 
Not a good sign, is it 
Congratulations, Michel. I had never thought that your helmet of Fangio deserves the amount! Because that's Fangioh 
It was a good affair. Really great 
Actually 
It's your helmet? 
Yes, that's what we call "unexpexted" 
Who is she? 
A "nightmare" 
What are you doing totally in the dark? 
So they are going to race, aren't they? 
Where is No.13? 
Henri 
For 30 years 
I have never talked about the affairs 
But, just for this once, I beg of you: 
Please don't go through with it! 
It's impossible 
Being a champion has nothing to do with the nightmare Talking about dream 
Our dream of Michel, Jean-Pierre and me ... Is the winning in the 24 hour-race of Le Mans I can't do that 
Page 9/24
David who used to be as fast as a rabit Now becomes a tortoise 
Straight down! 120!

Damn! Can't go out!

We're not gonna let Cramer take it! Go, hurry up! 
Tell Michel to "catch up with them"! You are alright? 
Good 
That is Giulio! 
Vehicle is damaged! 
How about David? 
He is intact 
Michel! 
Michel, stand aside! 
Danger! 
Stand aside! 
Page 10/24
David! 
Stand aside! 
I'm Michel 
I know who you are 
Thanks for your coming all these way 
You mean a lot to david 
Maybe he looks on you as family 
He meant a lot to us, too 
This is Jean-Pierre, my brother. 
And Steve Warson. 
Father has asked for appologise for not able to being here It's really a lot to him 
I know 
We want you to know, if there is anything you need We will all be here with you 
I've heard about Le Mans 
That's his child dream... 
time? 
1 minute and 24 seconds 
And is that good? 
Good for the cars 
What do you mean by that? 
9 seconds slower than the job recorded. 
That is the same as 9 light-years. 
You must try hard to win 
Currently it's hard to win 
Idiot! 
Maybe it's because of the car 
Listen! We have a contract... 
Shut up! 
Get out of here! 
You could wait for me at office 
I am too curious. 
I had to see the studio. 
David has spoken about it a lot... 
Come on 
Is that Michel? 
No, it's me 
You were a driver? 
Hundreds of years ago. 
Don't you miss it? 
My parents have 2 sons... 
And I'm the one brakes more slowly 
than the other... 
Page 11/24
Is the application still in effect? 
Of course, Julia? What can I do for you I'd like to have my husband's place. 
I wanna drive for Le Mans! 
Now only less than 24 hours remains 
Look at this! 
Who is that? 
Julie Wood 
Not bad at all! 
She said she want to replace David in Le Mans! Have you said yes to her? 
I said no 
I've already tested 2 persons who can replace David Why shall we let her in? 
Just want her to test 
To see her ability is limited 
How much? 
55 seconds 
55 seconds 9 
The first result is not bad! 
Come on! 
How are you doing? 
I pilot her around the track! 
Michel here, are you ok? 
Fine! 
Since don't know the track very well. 
I've got to give me 2, 3 points? 
I know that! 
Follow me! 
Big turn! 
Left! right! tempo 5! 
Tempo 6! 
Big turn! Along the stone! 
Accelerate at the exit! 
Your turn! 
No problem! 
Left 160R! 
Go in! 
Do it yourself! 
Yourself! 
What's the guy doing? 
What's up? 
Because if we promise her, 
she will try her best anyway 
Page 12/24
Julia wants to race in memory of David that's not enough 
"want to try" is really uncommon 
Besides, the stopwatch will give you equal chance. The job record is 51"1 
Let us assume that they get it within 4 seconds then they really stand a chance to win! I give wants her 3 seconds as they usually get. Great! 3 second! 
53"9! 
That is less than 3 sec. 
I see, please let me set up a team with Cavallo. I understand 
So? 
It is not too good 
But, you and your brother have an agreement on... Look, no favors ok. 
If I'm not good enough, just tell me! 
Julie 
Your results is less than 3 seconds 
Really? 
I'm sure This is for you 
Welcome to the team Vaillants! 
Thanks! 
Well done! 
Thank you! 
Stop! 
Drawer Jonquie? 
Yes, all 3 generations live here 
And around this house 
I rode my first car. 
How old was you then? 
Laura! Stop! 
Stop! can't you hear! 
Michel, do something! Don't just stand there! Be right back! 
Uncle Michel! 
Quite good, Laura! 
Really 
You must look ahead when you drive the car Stop! 
Brake 
You two! 
Hum! Good! 
Page 13/24
Turn left slowly 
You brake softly 
And stop at the gate. 
But I can't reach the pedals 
Ok, turn left slowly 
At the gate, stop at the driveway 
Brake slowly 
Great! 
Julie, This is Laura, the daughter of Jean-Pierre. You are great, Laura. 
Henri Vaillant, the grandfather of the child who commands me Before learning to drive 
I want you to learn to obey! 
I can drive already 
Well! Then then only thing you need to learn is to obey! The insurance company understands but don't know what causes the explosion 
We have carry the wreck here to let Jos have a look Jos, what do you think? 
Proteus crystals. 
Which let the vehicle lose control 
Basically there is no danger if it's in the gasonline tank Only when the vehicle runs in the match, 
the crystal reach the electric circuits 
Then....Bang 
So how does this crystal get in his gasoline tank? I don't know 
Who put it? 
This id Gabrielle Steve, this is you 
This is Giulio 
He brakes at the 85 meters in the front 
That imprint is the mark 
If it's downwind, 85 meters is too short 
So he go straight ahead 
And where are you? 
Here 
You see the forest? 
This time of the year there are many falling leaves and keep the air cool. 
The temperature is thus lower here, 
the air is more density 
So it's easy to brake 
Zig and Zag? 
So it does 
Page 14/24
Then what about other circuits? 
It's from ancestors'... 
wisdom 
How is the currently tyre imprint? 
Good 
Le Mans will start tomorrow 
What do we need now? 
Hamburgers! My treat 
What do you say? 
Great! 
Let's go! 
Go! 
Taste like my hometown... 
Turn right at the 6th crossing 
Straight 200 sign, then turn left 
You've been in the curcuit for over one hundred times You should know it well 
Entrance of the stadium. 
Sturdy right, in 2. 
Brake softly, turn left 
Rush 
Yes! understand! 
I know it by heart! 
That means with the eyes closed. 
It's impossible. 
Why must you say that? 
Where is he going? 
Just follow him 
Where to go? 
Cover my eyes with your hands 
Are you sure? 
Just told me at the 100 signs 
Ready? 
Go 
Sign! 
Michel! 
Sign! 
Slow down! Sign! 
Alright! 
Sign! 
Watch out! Sign! 
Brake...Sign! 
Sign! 
Are you okay! 
Page 15/24
Goodbye 
What's up? 
Don't go to Le Mans 
Sorry, dear 
I hope my worry is wrong 
I hope so 
I hope you are safe 
Damn! 
No signal! 
Welcome to the qualify run for the 
70th anniversary of 24 hours of Le Mans 
"The leader" returns to the match 
It is indeed their first participation since... ...The passing on of Gentleman Cheek. 
The leader carry the numbers 13 and 22. 
We are expecting the their duel with the Vaillantes I've just been told that the Vaillantes is not ready yet Hopefully it goes well 
But what happened? Where is the car? 
Jos has not called me. 
Why didn't they carry it yesterday? 
Afraid of being breaking 
That's Jos's judgement 
Really strange! 
The vehicle is sent 3 hours ago 
Where is Jos's handphone? 
It will be 2 hours 5 minutes later 
If the vehicle is not around in one hour 
it is disqualified for the race! 
We can get contact with them 
Jos! 
I can't hear! Speak louder! 
Where are you? 
What? 
Where? 
Where! 
We got 18 minutes for 60 kilo! 
No problem! 
2 cars come together 
Watch out! the circuit! 
You have yet 15 minutes 
They are coming 
Coming? 
Yes 
Page 16/24
If you let her in via the Porsche-curve Can they yet make a launched round 
Please! 
I can't imagine a Le Mans race without Vaillants Give them a chance 
Open the 8th gate! 
They must run a round in allowed time! Still no Vaillants's car! 
15 minutes left or they are disqualitified It's emergency, the helicopter will pay you Does helicopter also need fuel? 
I doubt it 
56"! 
55"! 
54"! 
Vaillants's car rushs into the circuit! From gate 8! 
Faster! 
That's on time! 
They are qualified! 
Vaillants 
Find another way 
It's 10pm 
It's the beginning of the night performance. Time is 2 hours 
Tyre... 
That's alright 
What happened this afternoon? 
Photographer? 
Yes, how is it? 
Just take photos, don't ask question! Ok? the American Steve Warson... 
Want to replace Gabrielle Spangenberg Changing driver for the No. 10 Vaillants! Julie... 
Now Laura 's Schneid... 
Lead temporarily, 3 minutes 32 seconds 843, It's yours? 
Don't leave your dog running around 
Seems at the time of changing tyre 
It's possible that someone destructs 
Where is the vehicle? 
"The leader" doesn't show up yet 
But Cramer wasn't there. 
Page 17/24
Where is the truck? 
Attacked? 
It's not my fault 
That's it for tonight. 
Good night, see you tomorrow 
Seems I come at right time. 
What's up? 
I come to appologize for her 
Really kind 
She would do anything for me! 
Do you know about me? 
Who is for you? 
Thank you! 
I look on that as a compliment. 
What can I do to make it up? 
Michel! 
The setting you mentioned... 
Good evening, Mr. Vaillant! 
Soory, I wanted to talk to you last night. I must falling asleep 
Me too... 
Excuse me 
Calm down, Speak slowly 
Disappeared? 
Oh, no, mom... 
He slept next to the door 
He was tired... 
He will call you as soon as he is awake I love you, too, bye! 
Is something wrong? 
Where is my father? 
Good morning! 
Answer me in 10 seconds! 
Threats? 
Michel, you insult me! 
I was here the whole night. 
But if you don't believe me... 
Now, to answer your question 
Yes, I do know where your father is He is very well 
But if go to the police... 
now... 
He dies 
You win Le Mans, he dies 
Page 18/24
You don't race, he dies 
The only way you see your father live again is you race and lose 
I want you to know what's humiliation 
what's loss 
Good morning, welcome 
to the 24 hours of Le Mans 
Bravo at the early birds. 
It will be quite a long day today 
I'm really sorry, Michel 
I relaxed... 
and drank a cup or two, so... 
Are you angry? 
Last night, Ruth kidnap my father 
You are her witness of not being there 
She asked me to race and lose 
That's the deal... 
I can't believe it? 
I'm gonna have a word with this bitch! 
Just forget about it! 
We are talking about my father's life! 
Lose "The leader" in purpose, is it ok? 
Don't do that! 
We have no choice, catch the time! 
Time to think 
As soon as we have the solution 
We come in action! 
You may count on me. 
Michel 
I want to say thank you 
for David and for me as well 
See you later 
The green flag waved... 
The cars startup then... 
for a complete round in the order... 
That they acquired during the qualified positions.... and then the 70th 24 hourse of Le Mans begins! We are going to watch a fierce battle! 
Vaillants doesn't attack 
Seems there is a problem 
That's... 
Vaillants is overdriving? 
No, not yet! 
Keep eyes on the situations! 
Page 19/24
What's going on? We really try our best 
from the first rounds? 
I wish I knew 
Michel, is there any problem? 
Everything is cool. 
So what's up with the hero? 
Take a photo of "the leader" also! 
Okay. stand aside! 
It's strange! 
The 2 cars put on their seeds at 
the same moment 
It's rare 
It's rare that 2 cars put on their seeds at the same moment 
What's happened? 
I hit bricks on the track 
Vaillants and Cramer... 
Cooperate with each other 
Change tyre! 
Change tyre! 
Vaillants is still in the seed 
Change! Come on! 
When would you change the tyre? 
Move the tyre in it! 
Cramer leaves the seed... 
Oddly enough Michel Vaillant makes 
no use of this advantage. 
We let him win seconds 
and he forfeits it 
Wait for me outside! 
Well then, Henri? 
How do you like the show? 
I know you love your son 
Why do you do that? 
For my father 
I watch him suffer the whole life because of you As a child, I suffered from seeing my father like that Now Michel and you will precisely feel 
what we have felt for years 
For your childhood, I'm sorry 
But the truth is that your father 
is a cheater. He always a cheater. 
And I think you are more despicable than he is Don't be your father, just be be yourself! 
Page 20/24
Let me go home, I'll forget those unhappy things Impossible! 
Steve, waht's up? 
Why do you stay behind "the leader"? 
Are you afraid of speeding? 
Of course not. Everything is okay. 
It is a long race. 
That's ok 
Michel, you owe me an explanation... 
What's the earth going on there? 
Everything ok? 
So what do we do? 
Send Julie to come here 
What's up? 
Don't ask anything! 
I need you to do me a big favor 
What does it mean? 
I want you to take my place! 
Take you place? 
What for! 
Take your place? 
One hour is enough 
only Jean-Pierre knows. 
Can I count on you, Julie? 
Thank you! 
"58 kilo" 
a water castle Saint-Andreaskruis... 
Good evening... 
Nice to see you again 
I caught him in your car. 
Back into the seeds of ... 
the leader of Bob Cramer! 
What's happened there? 
He seems have hit something undoubtedly. Someone helps him out from his car. 
His sight is piece. 
He will undoubtedly let Boorman take his place What are you doing here? 
What's happened? 
Accident, A Pigeon. 
You must win... 
"the leader"! 
Michel... 
Anyway, I have to tell you... 
Page 21/24
There is something happening 
It has nothing to do with me 
It's Cramer who put the crystal in the David's car... He wa just slowing him down... 
The accident... 
Be careful 
What are you doing? 
Drivers change, and it is Cramer 
Show up again!

Be a good child your father like! 
Bye! 
Michel of Vaillantes shows up again!

Danger!

Vaillants attacks! 
Seems want to break away from Cramer 
The two cars hit each other! 
A furious fight 
What happened? 
What's up? 
They hit again! 
It loses control 
But after an escapade on the grass, "the leader" succeeds finding its way back! 
How come! 
But Michel Vaillant is again 
in the attack of "the leader"!

Only 15 minutes left, can't stop! 
Michel! 
Second in the racers that is 
behind "the leader", ... 
is the Vaillante no. 8 
3 minutes difference 
Your body-guard! 
Hopefully you ring me with a good reason. 
I believe you. 
And it is racer no. 8, Steve Warson 
The American must catch up with "the leader" for 3 minutes And 12 seconds 
Warson improves... 
Pulverizes the job record! 
Leaky tyre for Steve Warson! 
What happened? 
Can you ride yet? 
No oil! 
Shit! Incredible! 
"The leasers" is just one step away from the victory! Slow down in the front of the terminal! 
Stand aside! 
Get off and push it! 
Go away! 
We must win anyway! 
Cheer up! 
Hurry! 
I must win! 
Warson wins ! 
The 70th 24 hours of Le Mans ends now! 
Can go to the stage? 
Oh yes. You let me do 
the most difficult work 
But let me have a try 
I have somewhat the impression that... 
You take away the victory 
In my place, you will do it, too 
Of course! 
So everything is cool! 
How is your feeling? 
Great! I think that I will come back! 
Congratulations to you! 
Would you help me to hold it, sweetheart? Oh really! Ah
