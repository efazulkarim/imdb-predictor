(slow, ominous music)

Welcome back to the program.

If you're just tuning
in, I'm sitting here live

with the sole survivor of
the Miles County m*ssacre,

which occurred exactly one year
ago today.

I've worked on this show for
many years

and I've never sat across from
someone

who has a story to tell quite
like yours.

Thank you again for taking the
time

to sit down and speak with me.

[Survivor] It's my pleasure.

Now when we left off we were
talking

about the moment you
woke up from the coma.

Do you remember your initial
reaction

when you first saw your face?

[Survivor] Yes.

Would you like to share that
with us?

(dramatic music)

I wished I was dead.

Do you still feel that way?

People are frightened
by the way that I look,

especially children.

And it's really difficult
for me to deal with that,

so isolation is ideal.

Now what about your attacker,

a man identified only as Art the
Clown?

There's a lot of controversy
surrounding his supposed death.

The authorities issued
a statement claiming

that his body disappeared from
the county coroner's office

the morning after the attack.

He's dead.

I saw it happen.

(glass shattering)

(dramatic rock music)

Did you watch it?

Oh my God, I thought she
was going to attack me.

(dramatic music)

(people talking)

My heart was pounding the entire
time.

Yeah well, if you think she
looks that bad on television,

imagine what she looks like
sitting two feet away from you.

I thought I was going to gag at
one point.

Babe, do me a favor.

If I ever look like that,
promise me

you'll put me out of my misery.

You think I'm kidding?

I'll do it myself.

Yeah, Tom said we won't
know until the morning.

But he thinks the ratings
are going to go up big time.

(rustling)

(laughs)
Exactly.

We've finally figured out
the formula for success,

faceless victims and a host in
jeopardy.

(slow, ominous music)

Yeah, watch next month, it's
going

to be called Monica's House of
Horrors.

sh*t.

Hey, can I call you back?

I have like people calling
me.

Okay.

Alright, love you too.

Bye.

Hello?

Tom?

(rustling)

(slow, ominous music)

(yelling)
(screaming)

(squelching)

(slow, ominous music)

(staggered breathing)

(coughing)

(laughing)

(tense, dramatic music)

(laughing)

[Dawn] I think I just twisted
my ankle.

Dawn, really?

Thanks a lot, by the way.

For what?

Promising you weren't
gonna get sh*t faced tonight.

Guys kept buying me drinks.

I can't help it if people
find me interesting.

Yeah.

Definitely your mind that they
were after.

Who are you texting?

None of your business.

You gave that as*h*le
your number, didn't you?

Oh my god, you're so jealous.

Of what?

That kid was talking to
like five other girls.

Oh, stop being such a b*tch.

Just get in the car.

Oh, you are not driving.

I'm fine.

Give me the keys.

Give me the keys.

Dawn, I don't feel like dying
tonight.

Really?

Are we really gonna do this
right now?

Give me the keys.

I'm gonna paw at you like a cat.

Give me what I want.

Okay, okay, okay, okay.

You drive.

- (chuckling)
- Thank you.

(wind blowing)
(slow, ominous music)

I'm f*cking lit.

(laughing)

But if I get something to
eat, I can drive us, okay?

There's a place that's
open late, we can sober up.

[Dawn] Did you say food?

I said food.

You know the place, it's
right there, come on.

Okay, okay, okay.

Just like give me one minute.

f*ck me.

Like one minute, for real.

(slow, ominous music)

D.

D.

What?

[Tara] Look.

[Dawn] Holy sh*t.

Yeah, that's not funny.

I'm about to scream.

Hey, handsome.

Dawn, cut it out.

My friend wants your number.

I'm gonna f*cking k*ll you.

[Dawn] Come buy us dinner.

Stop.

Just shut the f*ck up.

Or what?

Maybe he'll drive us home.

I'm sorry, she's drunk.

(slow, ominous music)

Let's go.

Come on.

Let's just go.

(keys jangling)

(upbeat pop rock music)

Oh yeah?

You get dressed up?

Oh, you're a sick f*ck.

Where am I gonna go?

Back to my wife?

Same sh*t.

Maybe another two hours?

Alright.

Alright, bye.

Great.

(phone ringing)

Ugh.

That was the longest
piss I have ever taken.

Thank you for sharing that.

This guy wants me to meet
him at his apartment right now.

What a shocker.

I told him I would.

What?

I'm kidding.

I have a little more
self respect than that.

If you only had a brain.

I've been wanting to
use that one all night.

Congratulations.

(chuckling)

(rock music)

Look it's your boyfriend.

I told you this a week ago,
we'll go to your mother's.

I don't know, six weeks from
now.

I'll be right with you buddy.

You gotta see the shape of this
fuckin'

guy that just walked in.

(slow, ominous music)

[Dawn] Are you okay?

(slow, ominous music)

I think we should get our food
to go.

Why?

(slow, ominous music)

Him?

Seriously, I wanna leave.

Jesus Christ.

D, stop.

Uh, excuse me?

Excuse me?

Can I get a picture with you?

Dawn, come on.

Shut up.

Hello?

(snapping)

Hello?

Okay.

I'm gonna take that as a yes.

(slow, ominous music)

(popping)
Oh.

Oh.

Sorry.

(phone ringing)

(slow, ominous music)

Thanks.

What the hell is wrong with
you?

What?

Did you think he was gonna hack
me up

into little pieces or something?

What can I get for you buddy?

Hey?

Hello?

(slow, ominous music)

If you don't order anything,
you're gonna have to leave.

You already have eight likes.

Can you hear me in there?

Oh god, it's gonna be a long
night.

(slow, ominous music)

(cranking)

(slow, ominous music)

Aww.

(slow, ominous music)
(Dawn giggling)

What are you doing?

Thanks.

(Dawn chuckling)

Okay, not for nothing,
but that's the nicest thing

a guy's done for you all night.

Seriously?

What the f*ck?

Here you go ladies.

Yes.

You two okay?

Oh, he's harmless.

You okay?

Don't worry, I'll take care of
him.

Enjoy your pizza.

(slow, ominous music)

What do you keep staring at?

That bag.

What do you think is in it?

I don't know, who cares?

Just eat your food.

You fuckin' freak!

Get over here.

All night with you, you f*ck.

Enough.

(tense, dramatic music)

Get outta here.

(tense, dramatic music)

Take your sh*t, and don't come
back.

(tense, dramatic music)

Ramon, grab a mob and some
bleach.

Eh, you okay?

[Man] Yeah, I'm alright.

(slow, ominous music)

[Dawn] What do you think
that guy did in there?

[Tara] Who knows.

[Dawn] Probably jizzed
all over the place,

f*cking pervert.

[Tara] Stop.

What?

I'm telling you that guy
totally whacked off in there.

He was obviously turned on by
you.

You're fuckin' sick.

You know that?

(dogs barking)

What?

- Look at your hand.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

Look, at least he had the
courtesy to do

whatever he did in private.

I mean, he could have
whipped it out right there.

I really don't need the
visual.

[Dawn] Well are you okay to
drive?

Yeah, trust me, that
sobered me right the f*ck up.

- Oh my god.
- What?

Your tire.

f*ck me.

Has it been like this the whole
time?

I think I would have said
something if I'd noticed

that your tire had exploded.

Why does this sh*t always
happen to me?

[Tara] Do you have a spare?

It's on the car.

Wow.

I'm starting to feel sick.

Just, give me your phone.

I'll call my sister.

(slow, ominous music)

Yo Steve, this is sick.

I better get overtime for this.

No joke, this is disgusting.

You got me cleanin' piss
and sh*t at one o'clock

in the morning.

Let the guy who handles
food take care of it,

real fuckin' sanitary.

Steve, time and a half, or I'm
out.

You hear me?

(rock music)

(phone ringing)

Hello?

[Tara] Hi, it's me.

Tara?

Yeah, my phone died.

I'm calling from Dawn's.

Ah.

Your phone died.

Can you ever go out
without using social media

every seconds?

I think you're the only one in
America

who has that sort of restraint.

Yeah, that's probably right.

[Tara] Did I wake you?

No, I am studying for
my midterm tomorrow.

Oh, sh*t.

Why, what is it?

What is it, Tara?

Dawn and I are sort
of stranded right now.

She has a flat tire and no spare

and I was kind of hoping
you could pick us up?

I have to be up in five hours,
Tara.

Yeah, I know Vic.

Don't bother, seriously.

I didn't realize you had a test.

(laughing)

Sorry.

I didn't know you were here.

(rock music)

You know what?

I gotta stretch my legs
and besides, if I fail,

I can always blame you.

You are the best sister in the
world.

Yeah.

Where are you?

What's wrong?

I'm fine.

Why?

You keep looking over your
shoulder.

Just thinking.

About?

Nothing.

Tell me.

What if that guy did this to
your car?

What guy?

The clown?

[Tara] I'm serious.

Well, you really think
someone slashed my tires?

Well, he knows this is your
car.

He saw us getting into it
earlier.

That's f*cking ridiculous.

I probably just ran over
a nail or something.

I should have just let you
drive.

Yeah, you should have.

But as usual, you have
to be the good Samaritan

so here we are.

Stuck.

Like a couple of assholes.

(chuckling)

(slow, ominous music)

Steve!

(slow, ominous music)

(dramatic music)

Oh f*ck!

(tense, dramatic music)

Help!

Somebody!
(phone ringing)

(tense, dramatic music)

(screaming)

(tense, dramatic music)

(stabbing)

(gasping)

Yeah, but what if I'm right,

and he's out there watching us
right now?

(gasping)

Show him your tits.

I don't know, Tara.

Look, that guy was harmless.

He's just some douchebag in a
costume

acting like a ret*rd
because it's Halloween.

(stabbing)
(yelling)

No.

He was different.

(stabbing)
(yelling)

He smiled.

The way he kept staring at
us with those dead eyes.

(stabbing)

What was in that bag?

(tense, dramatic music)

I don't know, Tara.

The point is, he's gone,

and you're never gonna see him
again.

So cut the sh*t, 'cause you're
starting to freak me out.

I really have to pee.

So go.

Go?

Go where?

It's the middle of the night.

I can't just pop a squat
in the middle of the street

and pee like you do.

Well tough sh*t, because
it's gonna be a while

before your sister gets here.

f*ck.

(deeply exhaling)

Maybe that guy has a
bathroom that you can use.

Who?

That creepy guy who just got
out of that

even creepier looking building.

Tara.

I was kidding.

Excuse me?

Yes?

I'm sorry to bother you.

Is there a bathroom in there I
could use?

Sorry, I don't own the place.

I'm not supposed to let anyone
in here.

Please, mister, it's an
emergency.

I'll be two seconds.

Honestly, I could get
in a lot of trouble.

Who's gonna know?

[Dawn] Just let her use
the bathroom, for god sakes.

She'll make it worth your while.

A friend of yours?

Yeah, I'm sorry, she's drunk.

It's been a long night.

Alright.

Just make it quick, okay?

Thank you.

Guy's even weirder
looking than the clown was.

This way.

Good thing you called me when I
did.

I was about to b*mb the
hell out of this place.

b*mb?

Bug b*mb.

Pest control.

What kind of pest?

You sure you want me to tell
you before

you use the bathroom?

Why?

Don't tell me it's roaches.

It's not roaches.

Oh good.

[Mike] It's rats.

Rats?

(toilet flushing)

All clear.

Are you sure?

Rat free.

What if one crawls out of the
toilet?

I'd make it quick if I were
you.

Good plan.

Do you need me to wait for you
or?

I'll be alright.

[Mike] You remember how we
came in?

I remember.

Okay.

Well, um, you have a nice night
then.

You too.

Thanks again.

Don't mention it.

[Radio Announcer] This is

We have a major development
in Miles County this evening,

where authorities are
investigating a double homicide.

Two employees at the Deer Hill's
Pizzeria

were found brutally
m*rder*d just moments ago.

No suspects are in custody yet

but police are on the look out

for a tall, thin man
wearing a black and white

clown costume and carrying
a large garbage bag.

No way.

[Radio Announcer] An
eyewitness spotted the suspect

after hearing multiple screams.

No further details at this
moment.

Stay tuned, and we'll
continue to bring you

You must be the new tenant.

It's nice to finally meet you.

You're really going to like it
here.

Isn't she, Emily?

This is my daughter, Emily.

Say hello to the pretty young
lady.

It's been quite a while
since we've had neighbors.

Perhaps we can do our laundry
together.

I could use some good company.

Yes.

That sounds like a good idea.

Will you excuse me a moment?

I have to find the landlord.

The first month's rent is due
and I don't wanna be late.

Punctuality is the thief of
time, dear.

[Radio Announcer] Happy
Halloween boys and ghouls.

The current temperature
is a crisp degrees.

The winds are starting to pick
up as well,

setting the tone for old
Samhain.

Now if you're still out and
about in

the Miles County Area, I'd
advise you to be extra careful

out there.

Police are still on the look out

for a man involved in a brutal
slaying

of two employees at Deer
Hill's Pizzeria this morning.

The suspect was last seen
wearing

a black and white clown costume

with matching face paint.

If you're just tuning in, this
is not

a Halloween prank.

The local sheriff has advised
all persons

in the Miles County Area to stay
indoors

and notify authorities if they
see anyone

matching the assailant's
description.

you don't get somebody

down here right away.

What the f*ck are you talking

The clown with the
white face and the little

black hat.

He thinks what he's doing is
funny because he's laughing.

But I know it's not funny
because they're all dead.

Get the hell away from me.

I'm telling you.

He knows I know, and he's

[Operator] What's wrong, sir?

I wanna report a m*rder.

There's two dead people.

I've got this young woman over
here

that's just been assaulted.

She's bleeding everywhere.

I think she's going into shock.

[Operator] Okay, give me your
address.

[Mike] Uh, Steuben Street,
it's the old warehouse.

[Operator] What kind of
injuries does she have?

She's cut all over.

Some places really deep.

I don't know, she's
bleeding all over the place.

[Operator] Is she conscious?

Yes, she conscious, but I have
no idea

for how long.

[Operator] Where is the
assailant now?

I knocked him out.

If this guy wakes up,
we are not safe here.

This guy is armed and he's
a total f*cking maniac.

[Operator] Okay, sir,
what I want you to do now

is just remain calm and
stay on the line with me

until the police arrive.

Look.

We are not staying here.

I'm taking this girl
to the emergency room.

You just get your asses down
here now.

I got my truck outside.

Can you walk?
(Victoria mumbling)

Okay.

Come on, let's get out of here.

Get away from me!

Leave me alone!

You f*cking maniac!

Leave me alone!
(bike horn honking)

Stop, stop it!

(heavy breathing)

(slow, tense music)

(chewing)

Police, don't fuckin' move!

Put your hands up right now!

Central.

- , male perp.

Possibly armed.

Let me see your hands!

Send more units.

I said show me your hands!

Put 'em up!

I said put your fuckin' hands
up!

(police sirens wailing)

[Police Officer On The Left]
That's it, nice and easy.

No sudden moves.

Your right hand.

Show me the right hand.

Last warning.

You're gonna get shot!

(tense, dramatic music)

Do it!

No, no, no!

(g*nsh*t)

(tense, dramatic music)

Central, we got shots fired.

Multiple causalities.

We needed buses and immediate
assistance.

(police radio chatter)

[Police Officer On The Left]
Oh my god.

What?

(Victoria gasping)

She's still alive.

(police radio chatter)
(sirens wailing)

Aw, come on, guys.

You're killin' me.

The revolving doors won't
be installed until Monday.

Good to see you, too, doc.

[Coroner] Okay, what
are you bringing me?

m*rder, suicide.

Wonderful.

What's behind showcase number
one?

Severe head trauma.

You're probably gonna have to
identify

this poor bastard by his teeth,

if you can dig them out
of the back of his skull.

So I should put on a seventh
pot of  coffee, then, huh?

You're gonna need
something a lot stronger

than coffee.

Landon said they just
found two more bodies.

Jesus, they get the sick
f*ck that's doing this?

Showcase number two.

No sh*t.

Police found him eating
the face off of some

young girl after he ran
her over with a truck.

He blew his brains out before
they could take him in, so.

Halloween never disappoints,
does it?

And it looks like it's
just getting started.

Well, seeing as how I'm gonna
be here

for another hours, thanks to
you,

you guys think you could
get me a breakfast sandwich

with bacon, or something with
bacon?

Bacon, really?

I thought you were
watching your cholesterol.

I am watchin' it.

Watchin' it go up.

Who's the MD around here?

How can you eat a greasy
croissant while

you're cutting up dead bodies?

Sweetheart.

I've been doin' this years.

Alright, once you've
seen an eight month old

microwaved to death,

everything else is just old hat.

Look, you had to ask, alright?

I'll hook you up, doc.

That's my guy.

Stay safe out there.

(tense, dramatic music)

Jesus.

(tense, dramatic music)

Let's have a look at the man of
the hour.

(tense, dramatic music)

I hope your minutes
of fame was worth it,

you sick son of a b*tch.

(dramatic music)
(lights flicking)

(phone ringing)

[Woman] You're really
going to like it here.

(phone ringing)

(screaming)

(dramatic music)

(coroner coughing)

(coroner screaming)

(tense, dramatic music)

Thanks again for everything,
doctor.

You'll be in our prayers.

Please, don't mention it.

We're all gonna miss this one.

She's been so cooperative.

Makes everyone laugh.

(laughs)

Well she certainly hasn't
lost her sense of humor.

Yeah, still a wise a*s.

It's good.

It's a good thing.

It's important to stay positive,
right?

Absolutely.

Good spirits.

She'll be fine.

Well, take care of yourself,
Victoria.

I'll see you in a couple of
months.

[Victoria] Thank you, doctor.

You're welcome.

So long, doctor.

Good bye.

What do you say kiddo?

You ready?

[Victoria] Yep.

[Doctor] Oh and, uh, good luck
with

your interview tomorrow.
