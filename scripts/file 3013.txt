I’m sorry we have to meet like this again.

It’s all I can manage today.

Maybe next time you can come in.

Don’t worry. I understand how difficult this is for you.

This is an improvement.

You’re not the first therapist I’ve talked to, but you’re definitely in my top ten.

I’m flattered, but actually I’m a social psychologist.

Oh, great. So you’re not going to try to fix me?

Wouldn’t dream of it.

So, last time we met, we were talking about friends, creating a support system.

Sure. I’ve got friends, online.

Release fear.

People like me who don’t want to participate in a society that’s coming to an end.

Like, what’s the point?

Well, actually-It’s all right for you.

You’ll be dead in 20 years.

We’ll be the ones left to deal with your scorched earth policy.

Meaning?

Fukushima, not an accident.

You think all these fires and floods are a coincidence?

And haven’t you noticed?

Nature knows to target the cities that fuel global disparity and destroy the environment.

The world is disintegrating.

Civilization is unwinding.

It’s easy to see how it happens.

The conspiracy cloud begins with fear.

A distrust of society, the need for truth and order to calm the chaos.

Where groups of likeminded people exchange counter-societal theories and create connections where none exist.

Hi, Ben, it’s Max.

I’ve got something you might want to see.

I’ll send you an address.

Jesus.

You think he changed his mind?

Hold it together.

We have to be quick. They’re clearing the scene.

Okay, best behavior. She got you in here.

Ben Monroe.

The ride-along.

Hands in pockets, you’re just observing. Okay?

Sure. Thank you.

What happened here? Bad pills?

Very deliberately so.

Looks like cyanide.

It wasn’t accidental.

They killed themselves in shifts, so each person and their possessions could be precisely arranged.

And then there’s this.

They’ve all got them.


Along with the black spot.

Suicide note?

What?

“Sacrifice is redemption.”

“We return to source, so she may live.”

Was this group on your radar?

Up until now, they didn’t display any extreme ideologies.

The minute someone mentions sacrifice or redemption,

I’d smell cult.

Don’t be so sure.

You’ve probably heard the sirens call and don’t even know it.

I’m done here.

Should we go outside? Get some air?

Yeah. Good idea.

Feeling better?

Oh, God, no.

It’s my daughter. She just landed.

I’m sorry about that. I–

I’m trying to break out of the theoretical side of life, you know.

Most people throw up the first time they see a dead body.

I’m Nina.

Nice to meet you.

Paper? A book actually.

I read your last one.

The Science of Loneliness.

Really?

A return to community as the most important tenet of a stable society.

Simple. Perfect.

Don’t be shy. We’ve all read it.

How else do you think you got in here?

What did you mean before? The sirens call…

Well, it all depends on what you consider to be a cult.

Do you believe in the afterlife?

Living by a set of rules that dictates whether you get in or not?

Not this heathen, no.

That group mentality is all around us.

Ever served in the armed forces?

Or maybe you have a therapist you wouldn’t dream of challenging.

I actually make a point of avoiding all those things.

Very smart.

You have to be careful who you give your power to.

Hm.

Fuck.

Excuse me. Hi. Is this…

Is this the right train to Kreuzberg?

Gneisenaustrasse…

Yeah, you’re good.

Yeah, this is right. Thank you.

Want me to help you with that? Erm… Yes, please. Thank you.

Curse or protection?


Hm?

Curse or protection?

Oh. My dad got it for me.

Curses are more my mom’s thing.

Or maybe it’s his way of reminding you, don’t talk to strangers.

Mm.

Probably has a point, yeah. Yeah, hm?

Well, I’m Mazzy, so now we’re not strangers.

Okay. I’m Martin.

Nice to meet you, Mazzy. Yeah. Me too. I mean, you too.

Where are you coming from?

California. Yeah, San Diego.

And you?

I’m from Berlin, so I’m going home.

I’m actually from Kreuzberg.

Kreuzberg? All right.

That’s how you say it.

Not “Cruise-berg.”

So I suppose we’re going to the same place.

Yeah, I guess so.

I’m on the fourth floor.

Come on up.

Mazzy!

No.

Come to Berlin, he said. We’ll paint the town, he said.

Honestly, the least you could have done was pick me up from the airport.

Your address has like five syllables in it.

My stuff is downstairs, by the way.

I am so sorry.

It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

Max called at the last minute.

I’m so sorry. Right.

I’ve missed you so much. Come here.

Oh, God, I’m going to die. What time is it?

Before you do anything at all, could you please just call your mom?

Let her know you’re here, and you’re safe. Please.

No, I need a minute. The whole ride to the airport was just sex trafficking and “raving consciously.”

Right, but you wouldn’t know anything about that.

No, nothing.

Hm–

Hi, Mom. I have not had to use my pepper spray yet.

Dad says hello and I will call you later. Love you. Bye.

How is she?

I tried calling her yesterday

about your food and your schedule.

Oh, no. Right, here.

She’ll be fine.

Apparently, this is all an exercise in trust.

She said that to you?

Oh, no. I overheard her telling Mitch.


Mitch? Yeah. Mitch.

Who do you think she’s off finding? Herself?

Okay.

He’s some whiny tech bro.

Honestly, the whole thing is really disgusting.

Uh, what chapter are you on?

It doesn’t really work like that.

It’s okay. He won’t last.

I’m so glad you’re here. You know that?

Thank you.

Okay…

You have to go back totally reformed. Okay?

That’s part of the deal

because your grades were offensive this year.

I know, but this is, like, the best punishment ever.

And your end of the deal

is that you’re going to come home with me, right?

Well, I can’t just leave at the beginning of the academic year.

Okay? And the thumbscrews are on to finish the book.

It’s interesting. Even you’d find it interesting.

Well, based on the last one…

I’m kidding. Go on.

All right. Well, it’s a follow-up, okay.

I’m calling it The Power of Groupthink.

Is that bad? I thought you said lonely was bad.

It depends.

I’m interviewing this girl. She’s kind of a hermit.

She won’t even let me in her apartment to talk to her.

She’s kind of like those hikikomori kids

I talked to in Japan, right?

I don’t know if I made it to that chapter.

Right, anyway. They’re totally isolated,

they lock themselves in their rooms,

sometimes for years, living their lives online.

Gaming, chat rooms…

Cool.

Point is, there are all kinds of predators

just waiting for them,

to welcome them into their persecution fantasies.

Like what?

Mm-mm. You’ll get nightmares.

Come on.

The first day is always daunting.

Just give it a chance, okay?

Hey. Did you forget something?

Still think this is the best punishment ever?

Have a good day. Make some friends.

Whatever, Dad.

This process allows us to quantify

the exact amount of chemical substance


found within the base solution.

You can expect to see a question about this

on a test later in the semester.

Thank you all.

Wake up. It’s over. Hi.

Larissa. Hi, I’m Mazzy.

American? Yes.

Yes! Oh, I’m not a fascist or anything.

It’s just so great when there’s someone new from home.

Do I need to assert dominance or anything?

Nah, they’re just a bunch of rich house-cats.

So, a group of us is going out in Friedrichshain this weekend.

You wanna come? Uh-Pfft.

No, my dad would never let me. Not even when I’m 30.

Ugh. Shame.

Well, maybe next time.

Yeah, sure. Yeah?

Om.

In The Origins of Totalitarianism,

Hannah Arendt talked about loneliness

as the common ground for terror,

the essence of a totalitarian government,

which bases itself on the experience

of not belonging to the world at all,

which is among the most radical

and desperate experiences of man.

Well, have a great weekend.

Paper is due on Tuesday in my inbox.

Thank you.

That was a really great class, thank you.

You look better.

A lot of paperwork had to be filed to get you cleared.

I hope it was worth it.

I learned a lot, actually. That I have a weak stomach,

and that I’d make a shitty criminal psychologist.

You can’t unsee that kind of thing.

I haven’t slept in 20 years.

Which would make you the perfect interview subject,

by the way.

You already owe me.

A preview of the book would make us even.

My students never pay me this kind of attention.

Well, I’m a novelty, Max. You’ll never leave.

Yep.

My assistant told me you were catching the show.

I was early.

Are you ready to compare case notes?

The BFV are desperate for your insight.

And I assume everyone wants reassurance

that this is a one-off and not a missed pattern?


Like I said, not on our radar.

The guy who owned the house was a doctor, a naturopath.

Create an appealing shopfront

to hide the sinister stuff that’s going on in the basement.

That’s a little reductive.

Well, I get rewards in the afterlife, they all offer that.

But what’s the initial draw? You can’t just lead with death.

Actual community. Belonging.

Not just likes and feedback loops.

I think it’s bigger than that.

It’s about simple answers to the big questions.

Meaning in life is important.

Order in the universe is important.

All things I could use right now.

Oh, I’ve missed you.

How are you?

Mazzy? This is my colleague, Nina.

Oh. Hey, Nina.

Hi, Mazzy. It’s so lovely to meet you.

This is a nice surprise.

I know.

And look, no bodies.

Come on in.

Hey, who’s the midlife crisis bait?

What, Nina? Yeah.

She’s just some nerd from work.

Said every husband to his gaslit wife ever.

This level of paranoia is not healthy.

Okay. No, you’re right.

Besides, what’s good for the goose…

Shut the fuck up, let me see.

Whoa. He’s hot.

Mm-hm. I met him on the way from the airport.

That soon? Mm-hm.

Has he messaged you? Yes. Look, twice.

Says he wants to meet up.

Oh, God.

How long have you all known each other?

Since Max deigned to do a semester at Berkeley.

Yeah. Worst grades of my academic career,

thanks to you two.

You’re welcome.

Thank you.

Cheers.

Cheers.

How is Lydia? Hey, Sofie.

No, it’s okay. It’s fine.

Well, according to her therapist, uh,

my “inability to process”

is worse than the last five years of our marriage.


And what about you, Nina? Where did you study?

Cambridge.

Well, don’t I feel tawdry?

You didn’t want to stay in England?

My family would never have stood for it.

Do something meaningful for society,

and then straight home.

Are they in Berlin?

My parents are long gone.

The rest are here though, still keeping an eye on me.

So horribly conventional.

Apart from the bit where you work for the government,

profiling dangerous criminals.

The devil has all the best tunes.

What’s wrong?

Uh-We have to go.

Party’s over.

Yeah?

You hate it?

No, it’s really… It’s amazing.

Sorry, I should have asked first.

No, it’s fine.

I’m sorry. It’s my dad.

So, um, where’s your mom?

Oh, um, she’s back home.

Yeah, my parents split up last year.

She’s farmed me out for the semester,

so that she can eat, pray, love, or whatever.

That must be really hard.

What about you, do you live with your parents or…?

Um, actually, my parents died in a car accident

when I was a kid. Oh, my God.

No, it’s okay. No, I-I’m so sorry.

No, no, it’s okay. Don’t worry. It was a long time ago.

I barely remember it.

I went to live with my grandmother.

Do you live with her now?

No, I live alone.

I’m not very good at being alone.

Yeah, but, I mean, I’ve got friends, right?

Um-Uh…

I work at an environmental NGO. Oh.

And, um, you know, giving something back

really helps to put things into perspective.

Yeah. Heh.

Yeah, I’ve been into gratitude

since before it was even a thing,

so I understand.

Yeah, right. Yeah, I get it.

Right.


What’s that?

You want to borrow it?

It’ll really change your perspective.

You know, we are shaped by our intentions.

We create what we think.

Hmm? It’s German.

Oh, right. That’s true. Um…

Yeah. It’s about mass extinction and what can be done,

even though we’ve passed the point of crisis.

Right. We’re all so fucked, right?

Actually, I told my mom…

I told her I’m not having children

to help keep the population down.

And she started sobbing.

Wow.

I mean, exactly.

Overpopulation is a big problem.

And we need people like you

who think of the bigger picture and…

Actually… you should come.

And… meet my group.

If you want to.

Really?

Yeah, sure.

Thank you.

And, there you go.

Are you working me?

Only if you want to show me the doctor’s manifesto.

Unfortunately impossible.

Headlines, then?

He was making a point.

He was deeply affected by environmental decline,

by social injustice on every level.

So, revolutionary suicide.

Exactly.

He set up free healing centers in low-income neighborhoods,

he was like a local saint.

With his own personal gospel, no doubt.

He was of an era that believed in community,

in social equality.

The ’90s was a bumpy re-entry for them.

Safety in dictatorship.

It’s complicated.

And maybe for an American not so easy to understand.

Well, I doorstepped the neighbors after you left.

Okay.

And they said that he became increasingly paranoid,

started preaching about the end of time,

systemic environmental collapse.

He believed what they did was for the greater good.


And there’s the hook.

It’s not a hook if you truly believe in it.

Yeah, but it all ends the same way. On a funeral pyre.

Robbed of their own free will.

I think they gave it away willingly.

They were just trying to give their lives some meaning.

So, all I have to do is throw myself into the flames?

Is there any fruit that you don’t eat?

Hmm?

There’s something on the list that your mom sent.

There are a lot of things on that list actually.

Something about…

…seeds and nightshades.

What will you sacrifice for your planet today?

Don’t be afraid to let go.

Release fear.

Embrace love.

Hey. Hey. You came.

Yeah. Hi.

Are you sure this is a good idea?

Yeah, it’s fine. Come on.

I want you to meet Hilma. She leads the group.

Martin. Hi.

This is Mazzy.

She’s a new… friend.

Hi.

Oh, what a pleasure it is to meet you, Mazzy.

We’re so happy to welcome you here.

Thank you.

Martin’s told me so many great things about your group.

Yeah?

Oh, dear Martin.

So he has told you about our cause?

Uh, yeah, a little.

Well, we strive to release ourselves

from our destructive behaviors,

our worldly attachments,

so that our beautiful Earth may purify and heal.

Cool.

Take this.

And remember, there’s no distinction between you and it.

All life is connected.

We are all part of the whole.

Right?

So, shall we?

I don’t have a mask.

You can have mine.

Why doesn’t Hilma wear one?

She’s not afraid.

Did you realize,

if we all lived like middle-class Americans…

there would be no resources left for most of Africa and Asia?

We need to realize that we can only exist

if we think as a collective.

Feel the energy that comes into being

when our collective focus is woven together.

Let’s visualize our planet healed.

Hey, Dad. Hm?

Can I go to the Reichstag thing with Larissa tomorrow?

Who’s Larissa? Larissa.

Larissa, from school.

Yeah, sure. Yeah.

It’s great that you got a new friend.

And are interested in politics and architecture.

Okay, thanks.

Just be careful. okay? Yep.

And check in with me every few hours.

Yep, got it. Seriously.

That girl on the news has got everyone worried.

Hey. Dad?

Who was that woman at Elsa’s the other night?

Nina?

Just someone from work. A colleague.

And you would tell me if you’re, like, dating anyone or…

something like that, right?

If I met someone and it was serious,

yeah, I’d let you know.

Do you think you and Mom would ever get back together?

I’ll always love your mom, you know that.

We are shaped by our intentions.

We create what we think.

So…

Are you ready?

I’m not gonna freak out or anything, am I?

No, no, no, it’s just mushrooms.

Nothing synthetic.

You know, real euphoria comes from communing with the Earth.

And sometimes that means… eating it.

Fuck it. Let’s do this. All right.

Hilma was amazing.

Like, magical.

When she gave me this necklace,

I could feel her energy.

She gave me this ash.

It’s from an ancient rowan tree.

And it’s to remind me that she’s transcendent.

That we all are transcendent.

Mazzy!

Mazzy!

Mazzy?

Come to me.

Knowledge is born of a lucid mind,

and purity is the gateway.

Have you gained clarity?

Existence is a lonely journey

of continuous death and rebirth.

So, what about you?

Is it just you and Mazzy against the world?

Yeah, yeah.

Her mom and I are still picking over

the divorce carcass, you know.

But on the plus side, she agreed to let me

have Mazzy for the semester, so…

To modern parenting at work.

I think she’s treating this more as immersion therapy.

It must be hard for her to be away from her daughter.

Cognitive adaption happens faster than we think, though.

Actually, I think it’s more of a trust thing.

She’s conflating the breakdown of the marriage

with your ability to parent.

Actually, it’s kind of specific.

We were at the beach with Mazzy’s friends

when she was younger, and Mazzy had an accident.

Oh, I’m so sorry. I don’t mean to pry…

No, no, it’s fine, honestly. She, um–

She got caught in a rip.

Happened really fast.

It was really frightening, obviously.

Then when we got her to shore, it all became about how…

I was watching the kids and I didn’t see it.

Sometimes after trauma,

we need somewhere to put our fear and blame.

It’s perfectly normal.

She stopped breathing.

But you saved her.

Actually, I kind of froze.

Her mom got there before I did and pulled her out.

That’s just a fear response.

Let it go.

It’s all over now.

You’re right. It is all over now.

…strive to let go of fear and hate.

Love heals all.

This is the absolute truth.

The guy can’t sing.

Don’t… don’t sing.

Leave it to someone who can. It’s not, you know, it’s…

…a basic principle of music. He tried.

I can feel your pain.

You’ll never be alone again.

Hey.

Why didn’t you wake me up when you went out last night?

You were exhausted.

I wanted to let you sleep.

Plus, you’re 16, you’re responsible.

I got freaked out.

You keep telling me to be careful,

and then you just go out.

I called Mom.

Oh, don’t worry, she didn’t pick up.

What’s that in your hair? Stop! What are you doing?

Wait a second. Just calm down.

Don’t tell me to calm down.

I fucking hate all of this.

Why can’t you just come home and be normal?

You realize you’ve ruined our lives by coming here?

Okay, Maz, your mom ended it. Not the other way around.

You know that, right? She asked me to leave.

I just needed to get away

and give us some space for a minute.

She didn’t tell you to go to fucking Europe!

Where do you think you’re going? I’m going to Elsa’s.

What?

And, no, I won’t be home for fucking dinner.

Hey, Ben.

Hey. I’m in the doghouse. What’s wrong?

Now Mazzy’s pissed with me,

and she’s on her way to your place.

Don’t worry. I’ll keep an eye on her.

She can cool down here and sleep over if she wants.

Yeah, that’s probably a good idea.

Try not to worry. Thanks.

No problem.

Mazzy. What a surprise. Come in.

I’m sorry to just turn up.

Our doors are always open.

I was looking for Martin. Is he here?

No, dear. Is something wrong? Come.

My dad, he’s just such an asshole.

Has he let you down? Yeah, he lied to me.

He snuck out in the middle of the night to meet some woman.

I came to Berlin for him.

To see him.

But it’s always only ever about him.

Is that what upsets you the most?

I had this accident when I was younger.

It was ages ago and I’m fine now, but…

I don’t know, I think it’s the reason that my parents split up.

Oh, there we are.

I can see that must make you feel ashamed.

Perhaps you wonder

if your parents blame you for their separation?

And that maybe he wouldn’t have left if it wasn’t for you?

Untangle yourself from your parents.

The sooner you stop relying on them,

the more powerful you will be.

Hilma says

I need to turn away from him.

That weirdo from the video you sent me?

What does that even mean? It means fuck him.

If he doesn’t need me, then I don’t need him.

Wow. Okay.

Hey, let’s go out.

Yeah, come on, I want to go to Friedrichshain.

No way. My dad is even more neurotic than usual

because of that girl on the news.

Well, your dad doesn’t have to know.

I can’t, okay? I’m sorry, they’d be furious.

Okay, fine. I have other friends, you know.

Do you trust me?

Just go easy with the red pen, please.

Pressure to deliver is crippling.

I’m excited to read it.

The Power of Groupthink.

You know, I always thought there was something mystical

about the idea of mass consciousness.

Or absolutely terrifying.

I think there really is such a thing as a group soul.

I’ve seen how a group gains the consciousness of an individual.

It’s extraordinary.

Almost telepathic.

Everything you do is for others.

The individual is swallowed by this huge creature,

and whatever the creature does, you’re swept along with it.

You should probably write that down.

Take it.

It’s yours.

Don’t be afraid to let go.

Release fear.

Embrace love.

Hi.

All is love, right?

Oh, my God, where are you taking me?

Seriously, where are we? Come on.

No!

No!

Get off me! Let me go!

Come on.

We can’t go home like this.

Come on.

No, please. I need to lie down.

What? No, Maz, no.

Come on, we can sleep it off in the park.

Hey, hey.

Sorry.

Are you okay?

Yeah.

Oh, man. Don’t ever have kids.

You’ll never get a good night’s sleep again.

Hey, hey, hey, hey.

Hey, we were worried about you.

No, no, please, I just want to sleep.

I’ll take care of this for you. No, please don’t call my dad.

You need to get the poison out of your system.

We can’t let you go home like this.

Let them help you.

Okay, okay…

Where’s Larissa? Is she okay?

She’s fine, she’s fine. I took care of her. All right?

They’ll make you feel better, I promise.

I’m so, so sorry. No…

Hello?

Ben I’ve been trying

to get hold of you. It’s Mazzy.

What? She snuck out

and didn’t come home last night.

What do you mean?

Martin made the right decision by bringing you here.

We’ll take care of you now.

I’m so embarrassed. I’m so sorry. No!

You recognize what you’ve done. That’s redemption enough.

I know young people today feel so empty.

But you’re very special.

Sinless.

Unblemished.

I knew it the first time we met.

No.

No, it’s all right, Mazzy.

You’ll never be alone again.

Now you’re with people who care about you.

Thank you. Thank you.

Okay.

Let us take care of you from now on.

I’m sure she’s with friends,

it’s just she’s lying about

which friend she was actually with…

Yeah, I’d appreciate that. Thanks.

Anything? No. God.

Hey. You okay?

You have to try and calm down. It’s only been a few hours.

She’s been gone all night. Okay?

It’s been 12 hours.

I’m going to call the police. No, don’t call the police yet.

I know the protocol. They won’t take it seriously for 24 hours.

I’ll call my people. They can help.

Really?

Max, what do you think?

I’m not a cop. I don’t know the protocols.

But if Nina’s got contacts, that will speed things up.

I mean, am I overreacting, Max?

She probably got stranded at some club,

and knows she’s in deep shit.

This will make you feel better.

No… Come on, just a little bit more.

Just a little bit more. Good girl.

Hey, Mazzy. It’s all right.

No! Don’t go!

Mazzy!

Mazzy!

Mazzy!

As with any deep cleansing,

it will get worse before it gets better.

Call my dad, please… Just-Please call my dad.

We are your family now.

Hey.

What?

Take a look at this.

Who’s that? I don’t know.

Sofie, do you know who that is?

I’ve got a lead! An unconscious girl was seen

being carried into a community center in Friedrichshain.

Did they call the police?

Of course.

Thank God. Let’s go.

Mom?

What will you sacrifice for your planet today?

Purity is the gateway.

Have you gained clarity?

Yes. Yes.

I fucking hate you.

No!

How dare you disrespect me, Mazzy.

Martin!

Martin, please.

Purity cannot be attained.

Martin, please.

It’s such a shame.

Please, no.

You were exceptional, Mazzy.

I had such high hopes for you.

That’s all they said, right? Nothing else?

I know as much as you do.

Ben Monroe.

He believed what they did was for the greater good.

She was seen being carried in here apparently.

Ben.

I wish our first meeting was under different circumstances.

I’ve heard so much about you,

about the influential work you do.

So many people must heed your words.

I’m sorry?

Your hypotheses are so comforting.

Community and symbiosis

is the cure for so much of what ails us as a planet.

We wouldn’t be in this position

if we were thinking of the whole.

Okay. I think there’s been a misunderstanding.

I’m looking for my daughter Mazzy.

It’s okay, Ben. Mazzy’s safe. She’s with my friends.

What friends?

These are my friends. They’re my family.

You can trust them.

What? So she’s safe?

It’s important that we populate our organization

with the most progressive and brilliant minds.

Your writing on the subject of collective consciousness

is so inspiring.

You have such undeniable influence.

You possess the mastery and power

to lead us to global recognition.

I don’t even know you. Okay?

We know you, Ben.

No, no, you’ve got me all wrong.

You have no idea how to reconnect with your daughter.

She’s slipping through your fingers again, Ben.

We can help you.

If you help us.

Do you really want her to go back?

Stop! Just stop talking, okay?

Where is she?

Huh?

Maz?

Ben, just listen to me for a second, okay?

We’re trying to help you.

She is safe.

She’s so happy here.

She’s met a wonderful boy.

We’ve given her a real sense of belonging.

So you can start healing your relationship.

She’ll want to stay and live here with you. With us.

That’s what you really want, isn’t it?

What? You, me and Mazzy?

There is no you and Mazzy. You don’t even know her.

You’re so lost in your pain.

Your rejection.

This egoism you have of not being your daughter’s savior.

We can rid you of that and replace it with real purpose.

The power of knowing you’re changing the world.

Wouldn’t it be wonderful if we could all experience it together?

What the fuck is going on here?

Have you even had an original thought in your whole life?

All that talk about a group soul, was that your idea or hers?

Oh, you’ve got the community and the love, but you’re all alone in there, aren’t you?

And now what? You’re holding my daughter ransom?

I’m calling the police.

If we are ever threatened, we will move our timeline forward.

What does that mean?

We are ready to make the ultimate sacrifice.

To purify and start again.

I thought I could help Mazzy, but maybe she can’t be saved.

Choose to stay, Ben, and Mazzy will have a reason to exist.

Exist?

Ben, the world is disintegrating.

Civilization is unwinding.

What did you just say?

And haven’t you noticed?

The world is disintegrating.

Civilization is unwinding.

Lake Liepnitz.

That’s where you take them.

You’re psychotic.

Max, call whoever you know at the police department.

Maz has been kidnapped.

What? Do you know where she is?

Lake Liepnitz. You hurry!

Mazzy!

Mazzy!

Over here.

Come to me.

Hey. Can you help me?

Where am I?

Mazzy.

Come here.

Let go.

Mazzy!

Come on, Maz… Maz!

Mazzy. Hey! Come on!

Mazzy!

That’s it, that’s it.

You got it, you got it. Breathe, breathe.

Let it out, let it out. I got you.

That’s it, that’s it. I got you.

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

I love you so much. I’m so sorry.

Existence is a lonely journey of continuous death and rebirth.

But I see you.

I can feel your pain.

And if you join our family, you’ll never be alone again.
