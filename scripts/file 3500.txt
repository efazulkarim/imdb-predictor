I'm in. 
All right, ladies, $20. 
Hey, fruity cocktail, 
you in or not? 
I'm out. 
JESSE: 
Well, I wasn't going to, 
but now that you put the idea 
in my head, sure, why not? 
I've seen that look before. 
I'm out. 
ALEX: 
I think you're bluffing. 
WALLY: 
ALEX: 
Could also be that 
the cards in my hand 
plus the cards that are showing give me an 86% 
chance of winning. 
But you know what? Go ahead, go all in. You got a 14% window. 
JESSIE: 
Am I? JESSIE: 
This is so much fun, 
gentlemen. I fold. 
Coming out. 
Shit, I didn't even 
need that one. 
Oh. Damn it! 
JESSE: 
JESSE: 
Every damn time, man. 
KEVIN: 
Page 2/46
One more round? JESSIE: I don't wanna play with you anymore. 
Dude, this sucks. 
What sucks? 
This. 
College, man, it's over. 
No more fun. 
(PHONE RINGING) 
Alex's room. 
I'm not here, I'm not here. 
No, this is Ben. Who's this? 
Yeah, just a second. 
Dude, it's Melissa. 
What? Yeah. 
She said she's calling you back from, like, two weeks ago. 
Remember when you 
drunk-dialed her? 
(STAMMERS) Well, tell her I'm not here... Are you kidding me? 
You've had the biggest crush on this girl for the past six months. You gotta talk to her now. 
Melissa? Hi. 
Hey, you know, I'm... 
I'm in the middle of something right now. Could I call you back? 
Great. 
Who are you? 
I know. 
JESSE: 
BEN: 
Stars tournament on TV. 
JESSE: 
making photocopies in a law firm. Guys, please. 
I've been up all night. 
What do you have, anyways? 
A pair of ladies. 
Nice. 
(BEEPING) 
Page 3/46
Yeah! 
(ALL CHEERING) 
Yeah. 
ALEX: 
MRS. STILLMAN: 
so proud of you, honey. 
MR. STILLMAN: 
Thank you. 
MR. STILLMAN: 
cum laude, not bad. 
But summa could've gotten you a full scholarship to law school. Alan. 
Hey, guys, Mr. and Mrs. S. 
Hey, Ben. Hey. 
What's up, my man? Hey. 
How are you? 
Where are those Girls 
Gone Wild chicks at? 
Open your eyes, kid. 
Hey, you didn't say 
anything, did you? 
No, no, I swear, I didn't say a word... Didn't say a word about what? 
I just... Alex? 
I kind of got into a tournament. Sweet! 
I got it. 
It's only for a couple of days. You promised this 
was just a hobby. 
It won't get out of hand. 
It won't get out of hand. 
Come... Come on. 
I beat out hundreds of people. I stuck my neck out 
to get you that job. 
And I'll still be there. 
This is a big deal. 
Thanks for being here with us

at the Poker Stars.com 
$10 million challenge. 
I'm Greg "Fossilman" Raymer 
and working with me... 
Joseph Hachem. 
So, Greg, 
what have you got there? 
Well, Joe, in case any of our 
players don't show up today, 
I'm ready to jump in 
any time they want. 
JOE: 
let's meet our players. 
Antonio "The 
Magician" Esfandiari, 
"The Unabomber" Phil Laak. 
Tex Button, 
and of course, the crowd 
favorite, Karen "Razor" Jones. 
HELEN: 
Nope, no, I'm fine. 
JOE: 
young gun in just a minute. 
(SWITCHING CHANNELS) 
ANNOUNCER: 
Do you wanna give 
me a hand in here? 
Guy's on third. 
I'll be right in. 
ANNOUNCER: 
Up next is Phil Cabaratta. 
The first time, he walked 
and moved around there, 
and the next time, he banged 
himself out a triple. 
JOE: 
dealt two down cards. 
A round of betting then occurs. Page 5/46

Then comes the community 
cards with the flop, 
the turn and the river. 
In the end, the best 
five-card combination 
wins the hand and takes the pot. Let's take a closer look at 
one of our newest young guns. 
I guess you could say I've 
always been good with numbers. 
GREG: 
just 21 years old, 
born and raised in Los Angeles, learned to play poker 
in just the last three years. 
And when this whiz kid went 
off to college in the East, 
he realized that there might be a little bit more 
to this poker thing. 
Dealer card. 
Thank you. 
KAREN: 
Right off the bat, huh, Karen? Yeah. Whee. 
PHIL: 
JOE: 
table today as our chip leader, has lost a lot of his stack 
since the start of play. 
Okay, let's take a look. 
All right, you guys have fun. 
Looks like I scared 
everyone out. 
ALEX: 
This young kid 
might get into trouble 
in this hand if 
he's not careful. 
Page 6/46
GREG: 
if you don't look at Razor, 
if you don't see 
what a strong hand she's got, 
I mean, 
you think top pair's good. 
Likes his hand. 
All right, I call. 
All right, 
kids, it's all up to you. 
PHIL: 
Interesting. I'm all in. 
JOE: 
(GREG CHUCKLING) 
GREG: 
paying more attention. 
All right, kid, 
let's rock and roll. 
Obviously, 
Razor has called him all in. 
Let's see what the river brings. 
JOE: 
very disappointed here, I think. 
PHIL: 
percent feels like, huh? 
Yeah. River didn't help. 
You were beat on the turn. 
You played what you could. 
See you around. 
Go back to school. 
He obviously got 
a little bit lucky 
to make it to our 
final table today, 
but hopefully he'll 
take something home 
from this and he'll 
be back next time. 
Page 7/46
(TV TURNING OFF) 
Alex, when you get a moment, 
I need you to give Mr. Wallace the briefs from the Longhorn case. Okay. 
By the way, today is payday, 
but they'll hold 
your first check 
until the end of 
the next pay period. 
Do you think you can make it 
for two more weeks? 
I think I can manage. 
Okay, good. 
Okay. 
Oh, and Alex, be careful. 
That sorter is 
almost at capacity. 
(SOFT ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) 
Did you find anything, baby? 
Hmm. 
There's one cruise left 
that leaves in July. 
Mmm-hmm. 
We can afford a third-class 
cabin, but that's about it, 
though we do get 
lobster for one night. 
Ooh, boy, lobster. 
Yeah. 
Why don't we go first-class? 
(CHUCKLING) Oh, Tommy. 
Honey, 
this money has to last us 
the rest of our lives. 
ANNOUNCER: 
Amanda's Pride, Lucky Day and... 
CHARLIE: 
I think I'll go hit 
a casino for a bit. 
If you're gonna go gamble, 
then I'm gonna go with you. 
Page 8/46
Oh, now, wait a minute. 
I'm not gonna gamble. 
I'm just gonna watch. 
What about Helen? 
I just told you, I'm just gonna watch. Yeah, I know. 
You'd probably hock your watch. I'm not gonna hock my watch. 
I'm gonna watch. You can't 
get into trouble doing that. 
If you put down a nickel, 
I'm getting up and going. 
Because I ain't taking 
the rap for this one. 
Like taking candy from a baby. Don't you mean 
a baby taking candy? 
I get it, because I'm young. 
That's really funny. 
Too bad there's no minimum 
age to spend your money. 
ALEX: 
But I better get home now 
before I'm too late for curfew. Lunch money for the next month. 
BEN: 
(WHISTLING) 
You really should be doing 
this for a living, man. 
You think so? 
Nice playing in there. 
Hey, thanks, man, 
I appreciate it. 
What do you think, Tommy? 
I think he could've 
done a lot better. 
Talking about me? 
Well, if I saw you bluffing, 
then everybody at your 
table saw you bluffing. 
What are you talking about? 
I flopped a set. 
Page 9/46
You missed your flush. 
Maybe you should 
get your eyes checked. 
Maybe I should. 
Listen, you know, you got a 
hell of a lot of potential, 
so if you ever want to sit down and talk about cards sometime... Hey, hey... All right, 
look, I think he's okay. 
You could do a whole lot worse. Hey, all right, all right. 
Tommy Vinson. 
What's that dude 
talking about, man? 
I don't know, maybe he's 
drunk or something. 
Did you really flop a set? 
No, I missed my flush. 
Oh, I had a feeling 
you'd show up. 
What? No, no. 
I'm just here to 
play cards, man. 
No, just give me five minutes. See the guy over there 
with the red hat? 
What about him? 
What kind of hand do 
you think he's got? 
Good? Bad? 
Good. 
Wrong. Okay. 
He's got a bad hand. 
You know how I know? 
How do you know? 
When he has a bad hand, he lightly scratches his face, like this. He's done it every time. 
It's a tell. Watch. 
Well, didn't it rain 
my children 
Like that. 
Didn't it didn't it didn't it 
Page 10/46
Oh, lucky guess. 
Okay. 
Pick someone, 
anybody at the table. 
How about this guy right here? Didn't it rain 
I say he's got a good hand. 
Ace, king, maybe? 
No. Ace, queen. 
Damn. You should 
be playing these guys. 
I don't play anymore. 
Hey, can you give me 
that napkin, please? 
It's a nice accent. 
What is that, German? 
No, it's Russian. 
Oh. 
You must drink a lot of vodka. (WOMAN SCOFFING) 
Boy, I hope you're better with cards than you are with women. Believe me, I am. 
You know, I won $22,000 in 
the Poker Stars Tournament. 
Razor. 
She just... Oh, man. 
Cut you to ribbons. 
You saw that? 
Yeah. 
Come on, man, I had bad cards. It's not the cards. 
You don't play the cards. 
You play the player. 
What do you have in mind? 
Million-dollar payouts. 
I'll cover the buy-ins and we'll split 50-50, right down the middle. What's the catch? 
No catch. You just gotta win. 
And you gotta listen to me. 
Every word. 
Why should I do that? 
Because by the time you're 
Page 11/46
25, you'll be set for life. 
Are you set for life? 
I could've been if I'd had 
someone to listen to. 
(KNOCKING AT DOOR) 
Hey. ALEX: 
You found it, huh? Yeah. 
Nice place. Right. 
(CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY) 
Would you like 
something cold to drink? 
You want a Coke, 
soft drink, a beer? 
Beer, yeah, I'll take a beer. 
Okay. 
(CHUCKLING) 
Is this you? 
Yeah, can you believe it? 
'79 Reno Poker Final. 
What's this? 
(CHUCKLING) Oh... 
My wife set that up there. 
That's the hand I had 
when I beat Doyle Brunson. 
ALEX: 
You beat Doyle Brunson 
in the World Championships? 
Well, they didn't call it World Championships then, but... 
Shit! 
Yeah, it was just 
called the game. 
Now it's, you know, 
multi-million dollar pots 
and diamond bracelets. 
So you never won 
a championship, then? 
I... 
I was in the top ten. 
I was doing great. 
For five years, 
I was kicking ass. 
Page 12/46
And then I... 
I lost my confidence, you know, and losing a lot of games... 
I started borrowing 
a lot of money 
from my friends, family. 
Kept on playing. 
Then I hit the wall. 
I mean, I hit... 
I lost everything. 
I almost lost my wife. 
She told me if I quit, 
she'd stay. 
So... 
I quit. I haven't... 
I haven't played a game 
of cards in 20 years. 
Twenty years? You haven't 
played poker in 20 years? 
Not even a home game. 
Oh, my God. 
Do you miss it? 
Not as much as I'd miss her. 
Look, man, if I... You know, 
if we're gonna do this 
thing, I don't know... 
Should we sign something or... What do you say 
we just trust each other? 
All right. 
All right. 
ANNOUNCER: 
Second hand underway... 
ALEX: 
not gonna come home and kill us? 
TOMMY: 
be home until tomorrow night. 
Focus. Gus Hansen, 
what's he doing? 
I don't know. 
He's betting too quick? 
Page 13/46
He keeps checking his cards. 
He knows what he's holding. 
Believe me, these guys know 
exactly what they got. 
It's a false tell. 
All right. I think I got it. 
Let's go try it out. We've 
been doing this for days. 
Come on, we've been 
through 100 tapes. 
You think you're ready? 
Tommy, please. 
Come on, you want 
me to be the student, 
let me learn the way I do best. Commerce Casino's 
just 20 minutes away. 
If we're gonna do this, 
let's do it right. 
(MONEY HONEY PLAYING) 
BARRY: 
Oh, man. 
BARRY: 
Gosh. Hey, long time. 
How you doing, Barry? 
Is that your kid? 
That's my kid. 
BARRY: 
All right. 
Yo, son, you sure 
you can handle this? 
We'll see. 
DIAMOND:

PLAYER 1: 
DIAMOND: 
PLAYER 1: 
BARRY: 
He's up 38? 
PLAYER 1: 
I'm all in. 
DIAMOND: 
A little different than playing on the Internet, huh, son? 
DIAMOND: 
What do you say we 
take a little break? 
Look, I just got bad cards. 
I'll be fine. 
Come on, Tommy, let ATM stay. 
BARRY: 
Come on. 
DEALER: 
BARRY: 
You're biting your lower lip. 
What? What are you 
talking about? 
Every time you get a bad hand, you bite your lower lip. 
No, I don't. 
Oh, shit, let's get out of here. Wait. 
Come on, give me one more second. Look, if I see it, 
everybody at the table sees it. Look, you brought me here to learn. Just give me one more chance. 
Here you come draggin' in 
Three a.m. again 
Page 15/46
Grinnin' that silly grin 
Smellin' just like sin 
Holdin' up that alibi 
I'm all in. 
Diggin' down deeper and deeper In that hole you're already in If you can't lie no better 
If you can't lie no better 
Hey, ATM, what do you think 
I ought to buy next? 
A BMW? 
Or a Benzo? 
I like Beemers, myself. 
BARRY: 
the kid made a straight, 
(CHUCKLING) 
I did pretty good, right? 
Yeah, you did good. 
Then I did good? 
You didn't like the lip? 
These guys got long memories. 
Next time you play them, you're gonna have to change it up a little bit. When was the last time 
you got laid? 
What? When was your last time? I'm doing fine in that 
department, thank you. 
Oh, okay. 
Why do you care, anyway? 
Well, young guy, testosterone 
popping out of every pore. 
It seems like you would be 
taking a run at everything. 
I want you to be happy, 
you know. 
I don't know, I just... 
For whatever reason, I'm 
kind of awkward with girls. 
I just wish they'd come up to me. It'd be a whole lot easier. 
You know, some of these skills you're learning at the table, 
Page 16/46
you know, people skills, 
watching, observing, listening, it'll come in handy for you if you just apply them in other areas. Like that tall drink 
of water over there. 
Just go over and say hello. 
(SIGHING) 
Everything will be fine. 
Trust me. 
I will do this. 
(ALEX CLEARING HIS THROAT) 
Hi, I'm... 
I'm sorry, I don't 
normally do this, but... 
I'm a Virgo. And before you ask, no, I don't come here often. 
No, really, I've never done this. I'm... 
Look, the reason I'm here... 
Do you see the old 
guy behind me? 
He thinks I'm 
terrible with girls, 
which, obviously, 
you can tell I am. 
Maybe you could giggle 
a little bit or something. 
I don't giggle. 
All right, come on, what's it gonna take for you to help me out here? Tell me why you're so 
terrible with women. 
I don't know, I don't know... 
Probability? 
Wasn't expecting that one. 
What I mean is, you know, 
asking a girl out 
is, very simply, 
a 50-50 proposition. 
She either says 
yes or she says no. 
I don't like to do anything where you only have a 50% chance of succeeding. 
Page 17/46
Well, if 50-50 odds 
aren't good enough for you, 
then you, my friend, 
are in the wrong town. 
But no, that is not true. 
You take poker, for example. 
Poker, you know, you can have bad cards, but it doesn't matter, 
because you always have 
the option of bluffing. 
And you don't think 
that applies to women, too? 
What? 
(WOMEN CHUCKLING) 
Good luck, buddy. 
I don't... 
Okay, let's start over. 
Ask me out. 
I'm sorry, I don't 
even know your name. 
Michelle. 
Hi, I'm Alex. 
Would you like to go out 
with me sometime? 
I don't know, Alex. 
What do you do? 
I just graduated college and I'm working part-time as a law clerk. 
MICHELLE: 
Yeah. 
No, thanks. 
No, wait, wait, I'm sorry. 
I meant... 
I meant, I am a CEO 
for a Fortune 500 company 
which specializes 
in software development. 
And I travel all over the 
world to exotic countries, 
which maybe you'd love 
to go with me sometime. 
Really? 
Sure, I would love 
Page 18/46
to go out with you. 
(BOTH YELLING) 
Seven-two. 
Maybe you could 
spot me a couple? 
Oh, never. It's all or 
nothing with me, baby. 
Of course it is. 
(YELLING) 
God! 
Well, I hope you're better at 
cards than you are at air hockey. You know what? This time 
I'm going to bring it. 
Let's go. 
(EXCLAIMS) 
Oh, my God, are you okay? 
Yeah, I... 
What if I'm not? 
What? It bounced... 
It hit the thing, I didn't 
mean for it to actually... 
(BREATHE PLAYING) 
I'm fine. 
It bounced. It bounced. 
Good trip, huh? 
Sure was. 
Did you like that gal? 
I mean, did you have 
a good time last night? 
And this morning. 
(CHUCKLING) 
You're a machine. 
I wouldn't say that. 
(CHUCKLING) 
Well, you got to concentrate, man. We got to focus from now on. 
I'm focused. This is it for me, man. I wanna take it all the way. 
All the way. Love to hear it. 
Friday night, you know, we got a tournament in New Orleans. 
This Friday? 
Yeah. Problem with it? 
Page 19/46
No, no, not a problem. 
ALEX: 
Hey, Ben invited me 
to go to Santa Barbara. 
I was wondering if 
I could take a sick day. 
I know, I know, 
last time, I swear. 
All right, thanks. Bye-bye. 
TOMMY: 
I gotta go to Cleveland. 
I should be back by Monday. 
I'll call you later 
to say good night. 
Money honey 
gotta get some quick 
'Cause this little pile 
I got won't do the trick 
Money honey 
money's what she wants 
If I don't get some quick 
I might find her gone 
Now haulin' these bundle of 
shingles 'bout to break my back And that jingle in my pocket 
ain't nothin' but roofin' tacks I gotta find me a line of 
work where I can use my mind 
Good job today. 
Get a little rest. 
Big day tomorrow. 
Rest? Come on. 
I'm the chip leader. Let's 
grab me a drink or something. 
Okay. 
So far, so good. 
That's all you have to say? 
Mmm-hmm. 
All right, you know what? You 
just calm down, Mr. Excitement. Maybe you'll perk up tomorrow 
when I win us $600,000. 
Page 20/46
(PHONE RINGING) 
(GROANING) 
(MURMURING) 
Jesus Christ. 
I forgot to tell you. 
Do not answer the phone. 
Who do they want? Because... 
(KNOCKING AT DOOR) 
Ignore it all. 
The players 
you're facing tomorrow, 
they're trying to keep you up. Maybe it's important. 
Do not answer the door. 
I'm telling you 
for your own good. 
Well, they're not gonna stop. 
Hi, I'm Chaniqua. 
This is my friend, Dolly. 
(EXCLAIMING) 
I told you. 
You can beat anybody at this 
table, with or without any sleep. All right. 
I'm gonna scratch my hand 
I've got the night before me 
I'm going to get high 
Till it hurt no more 
Feed the demon 
something every day 
You know I'm going to 
drown on the river anyway 
If you want to be a dead man 
Track it in your left hand 
Raise it with your right 
And bring me to my knees 
Hauling down the money 
A little bit of 
faith and glory 
Then you drown in the river 
Just like me 
God damn it. 
Awful cards. 
Bullshit. You know it's not 
Page 21/46
the cards, and so do I. 
Come on, I did 
everything I could do. 
You're tired. 
You're right back 
to your old bad habits. 
You didn't even 
make it to the money. 
All right, well, you can't 
win every one, all right? 
No, you can't. 
All right, then why 
don't you go and play? 
Because I promised 
somebody I wouldn't. 
You call lying to 
your wife a promise? 
You better go home. 
What's going on, baby? 
What? 
Where were you, anyway? Vegas? Well, I went to New Orleans. 
New Orleans? 
Yeah, for a tournament. 
I knew it. 
I'm not playing any cards at all. I'm just teaching. 
I had this kid I found... 
How much did you lose? 
$10,000. 
$10,000? Yeah. 
Tommy. But in Vegas... 
When were you in Vegas? 
(SIGHING) 
Now, what you don't understand is when we were in Vegas... 
I'm going to my sister's. 
Hey, Michelle, it's me again. 
Give me a call 
when you get this. 
Okay, bye-bye. 
God. Three messages and she still hasn't called me back yet. 
Will you stop 
Page 22/46
worrying about her? 
Just think about winning. 
What's first place pay, anyway? $500,000. 
HOST: 
Desert Bloom Poker Classic. 
Dealers, shuffle up and deal. 
Guess who? 
How many guesses do I get? 
One. Think you can 
deal with those odds? 
Oh, my God, you're here! 
How's it going so far? 
Really good, but it just 
got a whole lot better. 
It's good to see you again. 
Yeah, you, too. 
You want some? No, I'm okay. 
What? 
Nothing. 
There's just 
something about you. 
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) 
You're a good guy, Alex. 
Thank you. 
(SIGHS) 
Is something wrong? 
I just wish... What? 
I wish that we had met 
under different circumstances. How do you mean? 
You know... 
You live in L.A., 
I live in Vegas. 
So? It's 300 miles away. 
Four and a half hours by car. 
An hour by plane. 
Where are you going? 
My father's in town. 
I thought I told you. 
No. 
I gotta go home 
and get some rest. 
Page 23/46
You can sleep here. 
I'll call you later, okay? 
What? 
Good luck tomorrow. 
Susan. Hi. 
Is she there? 
Yeah, I'll get her. 
Hi. 
Hi. How are you? 
Where are you? 
I'm in... 
I'm in Vegas with the kid. 
You know, Alex. 
What? 
The World Poker Tour Championship, it starts in about two weeks. 
I'm gonna whip the kid in shape and then I'm out of here. 
Tommy. 
Listen, this is it. 
After this is over, 
that's all for me. 
I never thought we'd be having this conversation again. 
Listen, we're gonna win back all the money, plus a little interest. It's not the point. 
What do you mean it's not the point? It is the point. 
Goodbye, Tommy. 
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) 
Sorry about those 
last few hands. 
No, you did fine. 
And we made a little money. 
A little money? Come on. 
Sixty grand each. 
Well, minus expenses. 
To Bellagio. Bellagio. 
(PURRING) 
Hold on one second. 
Michelle. Michelle. 
Yeah? Hey. 
Hi. 
Page 24/46

Is this is your dad? 
Yeah, I'm her daddy, 
at least for tonight. 
Wait, what? 
Go find your own girl. 
Did you feel bad 
for me or something? 
Look. You don't understand. This isn't what it seemed to you... Did someone pay you? 
God. But... 
Fuck you. 
It's Tommy. 
I'm sorry about the girl. 
It was a really dumb idea. 
(PHONE RINGING) 
Hello? 
Here you go, sir. 
(SLOW MUSIC PLAYING) 
(CELL PHONE RINGING) 
Hello? TOMMY: 
what are you doing? 
Listen to me. I know this seems like a hell of a lot of money. It is a lot of money, 
but it's nothing. 
Nothing compared 
to what we can do. 
Just don't walk away 
over some girl. 
Don't you mean a hooker? 
Just trying to help. What, 
by fucking with my feelings? 
Alex, listen... 
No, no, I'm done listening, okay? I'm done. 
We're through. It's over. 
Maybe you can't read people 
as well as you thought. 
Yeah. Maybe you're right. 
ALEX: 
Jordie, honey, give us a minute. Page 25/46

Just one more sec. 
Jordan. 
(SIGHING) 
Hey. 
I wanna hear everything. 
(SCOFFING) 
Where were you this weekend? 
I told you. I was with Ben. 
All right, I was in Vegas. 
You guys, I came in third. 
Alex, I didn't spend the last 20 years of my life working my ass off so you could play 
cards for a living. 
Whatever. I got 
a partial scholarship. 
And who do you think 
paid the other half? 
Okay, fine. 
Here! Here's the other half! 
You won that? 
$62,000. 
And in two weeks is the big one. Top prize, $8 million! 
Alex, listen to me. 
You have a job. 
Not anymore. I'm quitting. 
Oh, Alex, now... Alex. 
ANSWERING MACHINE: 
Hi, you've reached Helen. 
Please leave a message, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. 
ANNOUNCER: 
get ready to watch history, 
as poker's elite battle for 
the game's ultimate title. 
It's the $15 million WPT Championship, here on the World Poker Tour. 
Hi, everyone. Welcome to the 
biggest week of the poker year, the WPT World Championship. 
I'm Mike Sexton 
along with Vince Van Patten, 
Page 26/46

and Vince, this is going to 
be an amazing week of poker. 
VINCE: 
exciting days of poker ahead of us. Each player has to 
put up $25,000 each, 
and the winner is gonna 
take home over $8 million. 
And what is really 
exciting about this 
is that everyone's 
gonna play this event. 
All the superstars in the 
game are playing this match. 
Oh, you're right, Vince, 
all the greats are here. 
Razor Jones, Doyle Brunson, Gus Hansen, Phil Ivey, Daniel Negreanu, Mike "Double Diamond" Jackson, Tex Button, 
and a rookie who's 
been making big noises 
since he played 
in his first WPT event 
earlier this season, 
Alex Stillman. 
Well, Alex is a great player. 
He is a young rookie. 
They're all talking about him. You know, he finished 
10th in a tournament 
in New Orleans 
a couple of weeks ago. 
So everyone's buzzing about him. But there is another great 
story and that is because 
there's a fantastic 
player that is back. 
A big comeback for the 
phenomenal Tommy Vinson. 
Well, what an amazing 
moment this must be. 
Tommy supposedly taught one of our Page 27/46

younger entries, Alex Stillman, a thing or two about the game. Now, Tommy hasn't played a hand of poker in over 20 years. 
MIKE: 
that's a long time to be away 
from poker at this level, Vin. 
VINCE: 
something, with Doyle and with Tommy there's a lot of history 
to this tournament, 
and it's gonna be a lot of fun. I'm an anaconda 
I slither as I slide 
Fools like us 
could live like kings 
I'm ready I'm ready 
Get steady get steady 
You know that I wanna 
I smoke your marijuana 
I lose it down the alley way 
And there's nothing 
left to say now 
I don't need no cheap success 
I'm ready I'm ready 
Get steady get steady 
Fools like us 
could live like kings 
I'm ready I'm ready 
Get steady get steady 
I'm ready I'm ready 
Get steady get steady 
It's about time now 
Y'all sure y'all 
wanna ride in this rodeo? 
Might be in a rough one, now. 
That's what I thought. Some 
of y'all need to just go home 
and take up the game of bridge. You won't lose your ass. 
That puts you all in, pal. 
You didn't want any of these 
Page 28/46
chips, anyway, did you, old-timer? Ace! Yes! You're all going down. But lord knows I won't fake it I don't need no cheap success 
I'm ready I'm ready 
Get steady get steady 
It's about time now 
HELEN: 
CHARLIE: 
No, don't even mention it. 
I can't believe he's 
playing again, Charlie. 
I know. 
But why now? Is it me? 
No, no, no. 
What could he possibly 
need with cards now? 
Dignity, respect. 
He just wants to 
hit that home run 
before he walks off 
into the sunset with you. 
He wants the title he never got. Something that no one can 
ever take away from him. 
I'm all in. 
I'm all in, too. 
Damn it. Nice hand, Tommy. 
Take care of yourself, Ann. 
Thanks. 
Wow. That's amazing. 
(CHUCKLING) 
Hey, what's up? 
MAN 1: 
I'll go say hi. 
Okay. 
Hey, Alex, how you doing, man? 
MAN 2: 
What's going on, guys? 
(KNOCKING AT DOOR) 
Page 29/46
Okay, Chaniqua. 
Wow. 
Hi. 
Can I come in? 
How did you find me? 
I've got my ways. 
Helen, listen to me... 
No, you listen. 
I love you. 
And I know you needed to do this more than I needed you not to. So I ask only one thing. 
When you make it to the 
final table, win it. 
Win it all. 
One hundred thousand. 
Raise to 100. 
Five hundred thousand. 
I'm all in. 
I'm all in. 
I'm all in. 
MIKE: 
Only nine people remain... 
Four hundred thousand... but only six make it to the final table. The pressure is mounting as we move toward that big money. 
Two million. 
Fold. 
Two million, Tommy? 
Haven't we done 
this before, kid? 
What'd you have? Ace high? 
I'm all in. 
That I should 
think realistically 
I have nothing left to lose 
Except for what's inside of me If at first I don't succeed 
I call. 
(GROANING) 
Don't tell me to go to school 
I'm not the guy. 
Page 30/46
The world is out there 
waiting for me 
Nice hand, Tommy. 
And they call me a magician. 
MIKE: 
has knocked out the Unabomber. Five hundred. 
All right. 
Make it 1.5. 
I'm all in. 
Call. 
VINCE: 
gets a jack, an ace or a spade, she'll cripple Alex and put 
him on the morphine drip. 
Here we go to the river. 
It's a three. 
Yes! 
Fuck. 
Read me like a book. 
MIKE: 
We're down to the TV bubble. 
Who's going home and who 
will fulfill their dreams? 
(EXCLAIMING) 
Two hundred thousand. 
You got something? 
All right, dealer, 
I would like to raise him. 
Make it 700,000. 
All in. 
MIKE: 
The Magician really has a tough decision to make now, Vince. 
VINCE: 
ANTONIO: 
Oh, yeah. 
Wow, I can't imagine folding. 
Page 31/46
All right, I call. 
MIKE: 
with the pocket jacks. 
Well, it's almost 50-50. 
MIKE: 
ANTONIO: 
Keep them small, dealer. 
Small. 
No ace, no king, please. 
One time. 
MIKE: 
caught the ace on the river! 
Nice hand, Tommy. 
Good luck, guys. 
Take care of my chips. 
I'll do my best. 
VINCE: 
Antonio has disappeared. Abracadabra. 
MIKE: 
we are down to six. 
We'll see you tomorrow 
at the final table. 
Pretty amazing, huh? 
God, look, guys. Alex! 
Hey. 
Oh, my God, what's up? 
What are you guys doing here? 
Ben told us what was going on. 
Oh, this is great. 
We wanted to come. 
ALEX: 
I'll check us in. 
All right, just give me two seconds, okay? I just gotta do this thing. 
But tell them you're my parents. They'll hook you up. 
You want some more? 
Page 32/46
No. 
MAITRE D': 
Excuse me, Mr. Vinson. 
There's a phone call for you 
up at the front. 
All right. 
Hello? 
Looks like you're doing pretty good in the tournament. 
Looks like I could 
say the same for you. 
Final table. 
Life's full of surprises. 
Yeah, it is. 
Hey, I just wanted to wish 
you good luck tomorrow. 
Good luck to you, too, pal. 
Second place finish wouldn't 
be bad for a guy your age. 
It wouldn't be bad 
for a guy your age, either. 
Look, my wife's here... 
Yeah, yeah, I just 
want to say one thing. 
Yeah? 
I know your tell. 
I'll see you tomorrow. 
MIKE: 
We are coming to you 
live from Bellagio in Las Vegas, where the largest 
prize pool in the history 
of the World Poker 
Tour will be given out. 
We had a record number of players enter this year's event, 
but only six still have dreams of capturing this coveted title and taking home over $8 million. 
VINCE: 
this is gonna be great. 
Page 33/46
Big money here this week, 
and let me tell you something. All the big names in the game were here, all the superstar players, but they are gone. 
They are dead men walking. 
They are rail birds, 'cause 
we are down to our final six. 
MIKE: 
line-up we've got for you. 
VINCE: 
is a cowboy in the house. 
That is right. 
Yee-haw! Saddle up. 
Get the tumble weed out of your hair, 'cause Tex Button is here. And next is the only lady 
at this final table. 
She's a former WP Ladies' Champion. From Montreal, Canada, 
Isabelle "No Mercy" Mercier. 
VINCE: 
Moving over to the youngest 
player at the table. 
That's right, 
he's only 21 years old. 
I mean, he looks like he just 
ran in from a Barney concert. 
He is the very talented and 
rising star, Alex Stillman. 
And next up is a guy who's 
won many titles in his day, 
but none for any amount 
anything like this tonight. 
I'm talking about 
the man, the myth, 
the "Double Diamond," 
Mike Jackson. 
Next is a top 
professional player 
who's made many 
Page 34/46
final tables in his day. 
From Los Angeles, California, 
Scott "Laser" Lazar. 
VINCE: 
Okay, now, 
rounding out the field. 
A very captivating story. 
We have an old-school 
poker player who... 
First time ever on the World 
Poker Tour final table. 
In fact, this man has not picked up a card in over 20 years. 
He's very talented. 
Tommy Vinson. 
MIKE: 
got it all tonight. 
Men versus women, 
old-school versus new-school. 
This is gonna be good, Vince. 
VINCE: 
the cards are ready to fly. 
Millionaires in the midst. 
Let's go down to the felt. 
MIKE: 
to today's final, 
Tex Button is our chip leader 
with about 12 million in chips. And Vince, in second place 
is the youngster, 
the new kid on the block, 
Alex Stillman. 
He's got about 
10 million in chips. 
And in third place, 
Mike "Double Diamond" Jackson 
with about 9.3 million. 
TEX: 
Page 35/46
DIAMOND: 
Call. 
Check. 
TEX: 
VINCE: 
just the pair of nines, 
he's coming out with 
another bet, 600,000. 
Call. 
MIKE: 
a flush draw now... 
Check. 
Check. 
MIKE: 
Tex has made three of a kind. 
VINCE: 
complete debacle here for Tex. Two million. 
All right, I call. 
MIKE: 
called him, Vince. 
VINCE: 
What a train wreck. 
Flush. 
Look at Tex. He looks like the chuck wagon just ran over him. Nice hand, Tommy. 
MIKE: 
monster pot, well over five million. Freedom 
Check it out 
Get on the move Freedom 
Get in the groove Freedom 
Heart! Heart! Heart! 
(CHEERING) 
Thank you, Jesus! 
Page 36/46
Come on, baby. 
Give me the queen of diamonds. 
Oh, sweet Jesus, 
give me something. 
DIAMOND: 
Yes! 
Aces up. 
I'm all in. 
Call. 
Yes! 
MIKE: 
There's our first casualty. 
Tex Button, who came 
to this final table 
as our chip leader, 
out in sixth place. 
MIKE: 
has flopped three fours. 
VINCE: 
MIKE: 
VINCE: 
Isabelle needed to spike a ten. She did not get it. She is gone. 
MIKE: 
But she's gonna take home 585,000 for her efforts this week. 
Now, Tommy's a poker legend, and to see him come back after 20 years and play in his first tournament and make the final table, it's phenomenal. And you know, 
he's playing so well, 
I think he's gonna have a good 
chance to take this down. 
All right. Well, let's cross our fingers for Tommy and get back to the action. Call. 
Page 37/46
(LOOSE IN LAS VEGAS PLAYING) 
MIKE: 
Jackson, out in fourth place tonight, but he'll be taking home 
$878,000 with him. 
Well, we're gonna take a short break. We are down to three. 
Stay tuned. We'll be right back with more on the World Poker Tour. You're doing great. 
And we go to a really nice dinner. You wanna go? 
WOMAN: 
do with all that money? 
ALEX: 
I gotta go. 
MIKE: 
time, and it's come down to this. The third-place finisher 
will take home $2.2 million. 
The runner-up tonight will take home a measly $4.1 million. 
And our champion tonight will 
capture a WPT championship title, as well as take home 
just over $8 million. 
Scott looks at his cards. 
Look at this, Vince, he finds 
a pair of queens in the hole. 
SCOTT: 
VINCE: 
both have the identical hand, jack, king. This should be good. 
Call. 
Call. 
MIKE: 
Oh, look at this, Vince! 
Page 38/46
A nine, ten, queen! 
Alex and Tommy 
have flopped the nuts, 
a king-high straight, but 
"Laser" Lazar has a top set! 
Check. MIKE: 
see fireworks here. 
VINCE: 
for either one of these guys. 
Three million. VINCE: Look at this. Lazar is gonna bet it. 
A significant bet. Let's see 
how Alex is gonna play this. 
I'm all in. MIKE: Well, 
he's going all in, Vince. 
He's come over the top. 
All in. VINCE: 
He's gone all in as well. 
I call. 
VINCE: 
gonna turn up the cards. 
MIKE: 
Tommy are gonna split this pot, unless Lazar pairs 
the board on the river. 
VINCE: 
he will be out. 
He will be our 
third-place finisher. 
Here comes the turn card. 
MIKE: 
clubs comes on the turn. 
VINCE: 
MIKE: 
Page 39/46
VINCE: 
MIKE: 
So that's gonna do 
it for Scotty Lazar. 
He is out in third place. 
And incredibly, Vince, the 
youngster and the elder statesman are gonna play heads-up for this title and the eight million bucks. 
VINCE: 
what a great effort by Scotty Lazar. Hit the set, but he is out. 
For his efforts, he's gonna 
pick up $2.2 million. 
As is a tradition on 
the World Poker Tour, 
when we get down 
to heads-up play, 
we bring the trophy and the 
cash out to the table. 
I'll tell you something, this 
is going to be a great story. 
I mean, we have the youngest 
player at the table, 
21 years old, Alex Stillman. 
What's amazing about this, 
he was mentored 
by the old-school player, 
Tommy Vinson. 
And now, they are gonna 
go up against each other 
and battle each other for 
the WPT World Championship. 
MIKE: 
The teacher versus the pupil. 
Who's gonna take down the title and the eight million bucks? 
Well, the price of 
poker is going up now. 
We're now playing 
with a $50,000 ante. 
Page 40/46
Blinds are at 
$250,000 and $500,000. 
VINCE: 
Buckle up, ladies and gentlemen. Raise. 
MIKE: 
On hand number one, 
Alex has the worst starting hand possible. Two million. 
MIKE: 
trying to steal the first hand. 
VINCE: 
He's gonna try to pull off a 
Winona with absolute zip and pip. Now, look at Tommy's cards. He's got nothing. He's got a junk hand. You gotta think 
he's gonna fold here, Mike. 
Fold. 
MIKE: 
In fact, Tommy does fold. 
So Alex takes down pot number 
one with a little thievery. 
Raise to two million. 
VINCE: 
That's a $2 million bet 
and the kid is betting with a 
junk hand, just six, four. 
He must feel like 
Tommy has a weak hand. 
MIKE: 
I think you're right. 
It looks like Alex has 
got him all figured out. 
And unless Tommy changes 
things around quickly, 
his championship hopes 
Page 41/46
could dwindle, Vince. 
VINCE: 
One million. 
MIKE: 
VINCE: 
MIKE: 
without looking at his cards. 
I've never seen 
anything like this! 
VINCE: 
first on the World Poker Tour. I mean, he's 
pushing it in blind! 
Is it gonna work? MIKE: Wow! 
Call. 
MIKE: 
Check. 
All in. 
(VINCE LAUGHING) 
MIKE: 
$8 million on the line, 
and Tommy Vinson has gone all in without even looking at his cards. Fold. 
VINCE: 
hand down. He's laying the hand down. 
MIKE: 
the play works for Tommy Vinson. You gotta be kidding me. 
(SIGHING) 
Make it a million. 
Call. 
MIKE: 
Blind man bluff. 
Page 42/46
Check. 
Make it another million. 
Call. 
All in. 
VINCE: 
absolutely amazing. 
MIKE: 
the question is, Vince, 
how long can they continue 
playing power poker in the dark? You can only slide so far 
on barbed wire, you know. 
VINCE: 
gonna look at his cards there. 
MIKE: 
He's peeked at his hand, 
he's got two jacks. 
Let's see what he's gonna do now. Is he gonna push harder? 
TOMMY: 
2.5 million. 
MIKE: 
I couldn't quite see 
Alex's cards when 
he bet the 2.5 million. 
VINCE: 
Tommy has gotta love his hand. Now, will he get aggressive 
and go over the top? 
MIKE: 
Call. MIKE: 
He's just calling, Vince. 
Slow playing him. 
VINCE: 
Page 43/46
Here it is. 
That's a dangerous 
flop right there. 
Of course, we don't know 
what Alex has at this point. 
Check. 
Check. 
VINCE: 
here comes the turn card. 
Check. 
VINCE: 
stare-down between them. 
Check. MIKE: 
VINCE: 
Okay, down to the river, Mike. 
MIKE: 
board, fours and threes, and an ace. 
VINCE: 
but danger everywhere. 
All in. 
VINCE: 
Vinson has gone all in. 
Now, if Alex should 
call and he's wrong, 
Tommy Vinson would 
become our new champion. 
Call. MIKE: 
So Alex is gonna 
need a three, a four, 
a pair of queens, a pair of 
kings, or an ace to win this pot. Tommy shows his jacks. 
Nice hand, Tommy. 
Well, that's it. Yeah. 
Tommy Vinson, 
after a 20-year hiatus, 
Page 44/46
has come back and captured the World 
Poker Tour Championship title, 
as well as $8.2 million. 
Vince, what a story this is. The 
teacher takes the pupil to school. 
(VINCE LAUGHING) 
That is gonna do it. Let's go down 
and talk to our new champion. 
Dude. Buddy, you kicked ass out there. 
Congratulations. 
Thanks. You did great. 
Second place finish 
isn't that bad, right? 
Are you kidding me? $4 million. 
I know. MR. STILLMAN: Yeah. 
That should easily 
pay for three years 
of law school, 
if you decide to go. 
Good job. 
Thank you. 
And here's to the new WP World Champion, Tommy Vinson! I'm Mike Sexton saying thanks for 
watching, and until next season, 
may all your cards be live 
and your pots be monster! 
TOMMY: 
ALEX: 
you can go fish 
and then have 
a couple of martinis. 
Hey, just give me 
one second. Okay? 
Give me a minute, will you? 
Yeah. 
Great playing. 
Me? Come on, what about you? 
I got lucky with the cards. 
Well, I guess 
I should thank you. 
For what? You're a natural. 
No, not about the cards. 
Page 45/46
You see me with 
that girl in there? 
Oh. 
I'm sorry you didn't win. 
I will, someday. 
Damn right, you will. 
Well, gotta go. 
Hey, so I'm gonna see you 
at Foxwood's next month? 
Not a chance. Going to Hawaii. First-class. 
(CHUCKLING) 
Oh, man, this is really it for you? You're done? 
I might come out 
of retirement... 
25, 30 years. 
You were holding in your 
hand a pair, right? 
Like nines? Tens? 
Tens. 
Tens. I knew it. 
All right, see you, Tommy.
