T-H-E-T-A 
T-H-E-T-A 
Theta 
[MEN CHANTING] Theta 
[WOMEN CHANTING] Ooh, stop 
[WOMAN SINGING] There ain't no woman Like a Theta woman 
[MAN] Come on, now! 
Theta 
[WOMEN SINGING] 
There ain't nothing greater 
[HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING] 
[CROWD CHANTING] Theta! Theta! Theta girls are lovely, we're so fine Rah 
And we came to rah 
[MAN] Go on, number two! 
Theta 
Theta 
Theta 
Theta 
Eighth wonder of the world 
Is a Theta girl 
[SINGS] He parted the sea 
[ALL SING] When he made me 
Red, black, and gold 
Deep down in my soul 
Theta Chi Phi 
You already know 
[ALL] Hmm... 
[ALL CONTINUE HUMMING] 
Sah! 
Mmm, ska! 
Ska! 
Ska! 
[MALE ANNOUNCER] Alright. 
Zeta Rho Nu's up next. 
Zeta Rho Nu, take to the stage. Damn, girl! 
Looked like a sniper hit you. 
- Oh, God. That was so embarrassing. - I'm a Theta now. 
- I don't care what people think. Page 2/63
- Exactly. You're a Theta now. 
Start caring. 
Jamilah! Oh! What's up, girl? 
[BOTH LAUGH] 
- Worlds mixing, head spinning. 
- I know, right? 
Oh, Beth, this is... This is Aisha. - Hi. 
- Hi. 
And Cheryl, one of our neos. 
Neo is short for "neophyte." 
It means she just crossed. 
Ooh, crossed what? 
Crossed the burning sands. 
Oh! 
So, you're like a Theta for real now. Like for real, for real. 
Mazel tov, neo. That show was... Fine for exhibition. 
They've got to step it up for competition. We will. Alright, look, 
I've got to say hi to somebody, OK? What? 
I do not choreograph all that dopeness so heifers can perform it mediocrely. What's Theta's motto? 
"Perfection over excellence, 
sister over self." 
- Exactly. 
- [AISHA] I get it. 
But let a sister have her moment. Don't be a Theta-hater. OK? 
My house would have been a murder scene if our sorority tried to work 
together like that. 
Yeah, well, Thetas, 
we don't F around with stepping. No, you don't. 
Stepping is like African dance 
meets hip-hop... 
Three words. 
Stomp the Yard. 
You think I'd miss a movie 
with a bunch of shirtless black men Page 3/63
and Chris Brown getting shot? 
[BETH LAUGHS] 
How do you two know each other? 
I was Beth's TA. 
Ouch! 
Or friend. 
TAs don't bail you out of jail 
after a fake ID bust. 
Now, if you'll excuse me, 
I've got to go holler at a brother or two. Bye! 
Bye. 
[MESSAGE TONE] 
Damn, girl. 
Your man cooks dinner for you, 
and you're going to Harvard Law together? [GROANS] I need to get on your life track. Dane got into Harvard early. 
My application is in. I just need to get my parents' recommendation. It's just a formality. 
I'll definitely get in. I'm a legacy. And, well... 
I'm me. 
Girl, bye. 
[BOTH LAUGH] 
Oh, oh, Zeta Nu, oh, oh 
Yoo-hoo! 
[DANE] Is that the ebony to my ivory? You know it is. 
- Hey. 
- Ooh, what are you making? 
Something special. 
Why don't you let it simmer 
and give me what I'm really hungry for? - Babe... 
- Sexy, dirty, big... 
[COUGHING] 
[JAMILAH] Mom! Dad! 
Hey. 
Isn't this a great surprise? 
Like Pearl Harbor. 
So, who died? 
You guys only surprise me with bad news. Page 4/63
You did it 
with the last two dead relatives. If I do say so myself, I put my whole entire foot up in this gumbo. Dane, we love you 
like a rescue puppy. 
You do realize that 
you're Mayflower white, right? 
- Country-club-brochure white? 
- [DANE] Yes. 
I hate that I'm lumped in with my brutal, imperialist, plutocratic white brethren who have committed every modern atrocity on a macro-systemic level. 
We know. You're an African American Studies and Poli-Sci major. 
All great prep for Harvard. 
God, I can't wait. 
Matching law degrees. 
We're gonna change the world. 
Aw. Reminds me of when 
we were at Harvard. 
We all wanted to change the world. And it is a shame that the one of us that has the power to do it... 
Here we go. 
...is a sinewy, self-aggrandizing ham. Yvonne had a little rivalry 
with a certain former first lady. Mom, seriously... 
Who has beef with Michelle Obama? That heifer... 
That heifer stole my internship. If you were more driven, 
you would understand 
just how devastating that is. 
Who needs drive when I inherited your natural brilliance, Mom. 
And thighs. 
- Enough. 
- Take the good with the bad. 
Oh, I deserve credit 
for not mentioning that. 
She adorns the walls with paintings Page 5/63
by mental patients. 
Yvonne! 
I'll tell that to the 12-year-olds from the community center who painted them, Mother. 
You... 
I deserve credit. My grades are tight. I was chapter president of our sorority. I love it here at Westcott. 
I'm doing fine. 
Harvard will not be possible 
with transcripts that are just "fine." I'm a legacy. Hello! 
That's like automatic admission. [JAMILAH SCOFFS] 
Jamilah, we came here today to tell you that we will not be giving you 
our legacy endorsement for Harvard. We had an agreement. 
If you earned a 4.0 GPA, 
we would give you 
the letter of recommendation. 
Dad! 
Sorry, I have to live with her. 
It's more important 
that you build your own legacy, 
not inherit ours. 
Sweetheart, 
we don't want to give you a fish. We want to teach you to fish. 
Speaking of fish, 
the halibut in this gumbo is on fleek! What is fleek? 
[TELEPHONE RINGS] 
[DEAN BERMAN YELLS] Bishop! 
What's up, player? 
You're a little jumpy this morning. Just... 
hadn't had my coffee yet, but... Dean Berman? 
You're a Harvard alum, right? 
Yep. They gave me a great education and a husband. 
Nick was a studly, closeted lacrosse star. Page 6/63

He'd sneak into my room, 
and with the passion of ten sailors... [LAUGHS NERVOUSLY] 
Such a good story. It reminds me of when we talked about the boundaries. Boundaries. Right, right. 
You know what? 
Harvard is my top choice for law school. I could actually really use 
an alumni recommendation. 
Aren't your parents alums? 
Um... 
Yes. But "legacy" - 
that's just a fancy word for nepotism. Home is where the Harvard is. 
I just made that up. 
[WHISPERS] Home is where the Harvard is. Oh, my, my 
Look at it, girl 
Just touch down 
Add it to the show 
I'm not phased 
Because we're in another city 
But I swear to God... 
[BETH] Hey, girl! 
Jumpy Jam. 
You know what calms me down? 
Is there something? 
Weed, Billie Holiday, 
Grand Theft Auto... 
Oh, and tickling my man 
in the rowboat. 
You know what I mean? 
I have no idea what you mean. 
What's wrong? 
My dad and my bougie egg donor 
are in town. 
- Oh. 
- Fricking killing me. 
I need, like, all the drinks. 
Well, SBB is having a party tonight. I know you think white sororities are beer-soaked brothels 
with less sisterhood 
Page 7/63
than an honor stoning. 
Yeah. 
But if you're just trying 
to drown your sorrows... 
come to my beer-soaked brothel. 
["SHAKE MY BODY" 
BY MICHELLE DELAMOR PLAYING] 
Shake my body 
Shake my body 
[ALL CHANTING] Chug. 
[SHOUTING] Is that a twerk pyramid? [BETH] Yes! 
Nectar of the gods, ladies? 
Yep! 
Are you gonna get "white girl" wasted? Hate this song! 
[BETH SQUEALS EXCITEDLY] 
Yes! 
Yeah. Hey! 
The next one's a neck shot, douche. Amber, this is my girl, Jamilah. Amber is the only one in SBB 
I've never wanted to choke out. 
I don't let her choke out the girls, but sometimes we pee in their shampoo. Yeah! 
[BETH] This is Libby. 
And believe it or not, the whole southern belle thing is not an act. Oh, Beth! 
Libby, this is my friend Jamilah. So nice to meet you. You all want to play? Oh, no. I'm from Philly. 
We don't play with our drinks. 
How precious! 
I've been dying to go to those mooky, blue-collar towns, like Philly or Detroit. Oh, my gosh. 
Have you ever been stabbed... 
[LIBBY SQUEALS] 
[JAMILAH] Oh, my God. 
My heart was so low 
Wait, you have black SBBs? 
What? 
Page 8/63
Love is a battlefield 
[BETH WHOOPS] 
[CROWD CHEERING] 
[BETH] Oh, Saundra, that was amazing. This is my girl, Jamilah. 
Jamilah, Saundra. 
You killed it, sis. 
We're not related. 
[MAN SINGS OUT OF TUNE] 
You're as cold as ice 
Somebody likes being 
the only chocolate in the candy dish. [BETH] Oh, my God! 
And that, right there, is Danielle Harris. She's like a skinny Kim Jong Ew. The Zeta Lambda Pi social tomorrow may get awkward. 
Amber called them all "Date-a-Bi" as some brothers know their way around a shlong. I wanted to bite off her nipple 
and spit it at her! 
[JAMILAH LAUGHS] 
[JAMILAH SNORTS] 
Hi, Danielle. 
This is my friend Jamilah. 
And this is her first SBB party. Then where is her goddamn beer? 
Be a better hostess, Beth. 
Oh, no. I don't really do beer. 
Weird. 
So, interested in rushing SBB? 
Actually, I'm a Theta. 
- Not heard of it. I'm sure it's great. - It's a black sorority. 
OMG. 
They are so mysterious! 
Do they really beat you until you pass out and brand you like cattle 
with a hot coat hanger? 
I saw it on 20/20. 
Maybe it was The View. 
Whatever! It was totally Babs. 
Do you line up in bikinis and circle each other's cellulite with a marker? 
Page 9/63
Used to. 
Ah, the good old days! 
How come none of your sororities have houses? 
Why don't you participate in Greek Week? Oh! We have a black girl in ours. - Do you have a white girl? 
- Oh, my God. 
- Are you the ones who do the screeching? - Danielle! 
Beth, sweetie. 
THAT ENSEMBLE: 
five years and ten pounds ago, maybe. That's a hard "maybe". 
So, that beer. Do you have Heineken? No, skip that. Do you have crack? [MEN GROANING IN DISGUST] 
Jamilah? 
I'm deactivating. 
What? 
You can just quit your sorority? Black Greeks are like gangs. 
You get out when you die. 
Damn. 
My point is... 
weak people quit. 
- I'm not weak. 
- Why are you quitting? 
I have tried! 
But all these girls care about is blow-drying their hair, 
and getting skinny and getting wasted... But there's sex. 
That's true. 
SBB has helped me get mad laid. No! I mean there's sex happening right in front of me. 
[LIBBY GASPS] 
This is just like summer camp! 
Oh, no! 
Oh, no, no, no! 
Bad Libby! 
Oh, oh, oh. Hey, Libby! 
Page 10/63
- Get up, Libby! 
- Beth, please go away. 
- You're making it awkward, and I like you. - Oh, my... 
Stop it! I'm trying... to help you! - [SHOUTS] Bishop! 
- [WHISPERS] God. 
- This has got to stop. 
- Are you hung over? 
[SWALLOWS] 
No. 
Well, wring out your liver, Bishop. We have got a big problem. 
There is a video online 
of a Sigma Beta Beta member 
having sex on their lawn! 
They're making porn on... 
[BETH OVER VIDEO] Get down, Libby! They're making porn on my campus. It's gone viral. 
Poor choice of words. 
If they can't get their shit together, I am pulling their charter! 
Yeah... 
Terrible. 
[LIBBY OVER VIDEO] Goodness! 
[BETH OVER VIDEO] Get down! 
Am I supposed to say something else? That you're gonna help fix this! 
You understand Greek culture. 
Oh, no. I understand black Greek culture. Look, you make this SBB mess go away, and I'll guarantee you 
admission to Harvard. 
[VIDEO CONTINUES PLAYING] 
- Nick and I will both endorse you. - Oh, OK... 
We want to create a distraction, 
make SBB look like positive contributors to the community. 
Ooh. 
Ooh, ooh, ooh! 
What if they did that steppy thing? - Steppy thing? 
Page 11/63
- You know... 
That's Voguing. 
Please stop. Please... 
Don't you have a competition coming up? You have that charity step deal. Yes, but I can't teach them. 
- My black card would get revoked. - Do you want to go to Harvard or not? [SIGMA BETA BETA VIDEO CONTINUES PLAYING] Frigging amateurs. When I have sex outdoors, what I like to do is... - Boundaries, boundaries! 
- Sorry. 
Boundaries. 
I cannot believe 
you're not stepping with us this year. - I'm mad at you. You're killing me, OK? - I've been spending all my time on Theta. - I have to focus on getting into Harvard. - Alright. 
You are a dope choreographer. 
You don't need me. 
You're right. You're right. 
I am seriously dope. 
Thanks. 
[AISHA CHUCKLES] 
Hey, did you guys hear about that sorority that had sex on their lawn? 
Oh, yeah! Somebody Tweeted, 
"S-B-B stands for Skanky Bougie Broads." It was me. 
Of course it was! 
Dean Berman is trying 
to rehabilitate their image, 
get them to do something outstanding. You mean get through a sentence 
without the word "like"? 
I mean like having them step. 
[AISHA] Wait. White people, stepping? - I know. 
- That's the dumbest shit I've ever heard. The dumbest. It's so stupid. 
Stepping is a black Greek thing. [CHERYL] Uh-huh. 
Page 12/63
I will say, though, that we did get our letters and organizational structure from white fraternities and sororities. What's wrong with sharing 
one part of our culture with them? Helping white Greeks jack our traditions is a slap in the face to our founders. - [CHERYL] Hmm. 
- No, worse. 
A slap in the face, then a headlock, and a weave yank. 
And that isn't cute. 
[SCOFFS] 
So, just to be clear, you're not on board? [CHERYL] Not even close. 
Right. 
Can you imagine, all those little Beckys trying to get the beat? 
They're trying... 
Girl, you're crazy. 
[CHUCKLES] Dean Berman. 
Idiot. 
[DANIELLE] 
Ladies, this probation is preposterous. We are not going to take this lying down, like a pillow princess. 
Our redemption begins at tonight's social with Zeta Pi. 
- I still like "Date-a-Bi" better. - You would, fruit fly. 
Be aggressively delightful tonight! Have sunshine shooting out 
of your hooters. 
You must all be sunshine hooter shooters. Hello. Middle of a meeting... 
Sorry. OK, you all remember Jamilah. She works for Dean Berman 
in Student Affairs. 
She wants to talk to us 
about our suspension. 
Please, enlighten us. 
[SIGHS] 
So, I think I have a way to save your charter and get you reinstated. 
Page 13/63

You would compete in a charity step show. It would show the Dean 
that you are capable of teamwork, community service, 
cultural awareness 
and you would get great press. 
That could be really fun! 
I'm an excellent country line dancer. That surprises no one. 
Thanks, but no thanks. 
We're sorority girls, not showgirls. Actually, you'd be legends - 
the first white Greeks ever to step. Uh... 
We're not all white Greeks. 
Right. 
Thank you. 
Stepping requires 
an extraordinary amount of discipline. And to make it easier, 
mentally and physically, 
we don't drink during the week. [ALL GASP] 
Jesus Christ. Calm down. 
I'm sorry, but Margarita Mondays at Borracho's - that's an SBB tradition. Turnt Up Tuesdays at Fleck's? Hello? And if you think we're missing 
Wine-down Wednesdays at Bedspins, you can lick my... 
I think we've heard enough. 
SBBs, we're out. 
No, no. 
Beth. 
The Dean is making an example of us. SBB has become a beacon 
of powerful, sexy bitches 
that every guy wants to be with and every girl wants to lose 30 pounds and be like. 
We are highly respected on Greek row. That's all that matters. 
[POP MUSIC PLAYING] 
Hey, SBB. There's a ficus in the corner. Page 14/63
Start screwing. 
[MAN] Oh, where's Tyler? 
He's gonna get some! 
- [MAN #2] I thought Devin nailed her! - [MAN] I think they both hit it! [ALL GASP] 
[MEN CHANTING] SBB, STD! 
[ACTRESS SCREAMS] 
[KNOCK ON THE DOOR] 
Did you order food? 
No. I just ate. 
[JAMILAH] OK. 
Ugh. 
Nice digs. 
Well, look who has their own slice of Wonder bread. 
Pumpernickel. 
Hmm. 
Can I help you with something? 
Step show. We're in. 
Great. 
SBB tomorrow, 9: 
Can't wait. 
Seriously, a Snuggie? 
I'm sorry. Did I... Did I hear that right? You're teaching a white sorority to step? Dean Berman is forcing me. 
Look, there are better ways to impress Harvard than playing Debbie Allen. Oh, well, thanks for having my back, just like you did with my parents. They had a point. 
You don't aim high enough. 
Your ancestors fought 
for your access to education. 
- Honor their struggle. 
- Struggle? 
You should honor my struggle 
not to slap you. 
Snuggle me! 
It is 9: 
You are late to an event taking place Page 15/63

literally a hundred feet 
from your bedroom. 
[SHOUTS] Get your flat asses in gear! Go, go, go! 
My ass is perfectly shaped for my frame! Line up in two rows. 
Do we have to do this in the basement? It is really creepy down here. 
Says the girl who does it in the bushes. Stepping makes a lot of noise. 
If we do this upstairs, your neighbors will burn this place to the ground. Where's Amber? 
Does she get a demerit, Drill Sargent? You know, 
when I was president of my sorority, I led by example. 
Maybe if you tried that, 
your charter wouldn't be in danger. [WOMEN] Ooh! 
OK. Now that we're all here... 
What makes a great step team? 
- Oh! Big-ass feet. 
- Jesus. 
Clever. 
- But no. 
- Oh. 
- Unity. 
- Unity! I was going to guess that. In order to create the beat, 
everyone has to be in sync. 
Like our periods. 
The audience spots mistakes 
and weak links immediately, 
and then you are done. 
You have to think of yourselves as limbs of the same body. 
Sounds really corporate retreat-y. Are we gonna do trust falls next? [WOMEN LAUGH] 
Do not talk while I am talking. I'll extend you the same courtesy. It's like mutual respect. 
OK? 
Page 16/63
OK. Let's back it up a little bit. Let me see you guys dance. 
We are here to step. 
That's different to dance. 
[JAMILAH] You're right. 
But I've got to see what I'm working with. [HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING] 
First five. 
["LEFT FOOT, RIGHT FOOT" 
BY ILOVEMEMPHIS PLAYING] 
Turn it up right now 
Left foot, right foot 
Left foot, right foot 
Left foot, right foot 
Get it on 
Left foot, right foot 
Left foot, right foot 
Left foot, right foot 
Put your hands up 
Waa! 
Hit it on them, hit it on them 
Hit it on them 
Hit it on them, hit it on them 
Hit it on them 
Put your hands up 
OK, people, let's get started 
I'm the turn up king 
So I'm piping 
Every guy is like, "Aye" 
If you can't dance... 
Um... 
It's OK 
Left foot, right foot 
Come and swing my way 
Memphis is my state 
But I'm always in the A 
And when I do my dance 
Everybody's like "Ay" 
Swag surfing caught a wave 
And I ain't coming back down 
Left foot, right foot 
Turn up right now 
OK! I've seen enough. 
Alright. Today, 
Page 17/63
we're gonna do some stepping. 
I'm gonna teach you an eight-count. Watch my hands, watch my feet, 
and really listen to the rhythm. OK. Now, slow... 
Now you try it. 
Five, six, seven, eight. 
Stomp, clap, slap. 
Stomp, clap. 
Bend your knees. 
[UNCOORDINATED CLAPPING] 
OK, just stop! This is so childish. This is going to impress no one. Danielle... 
try the step alone. 
My pleasure. 
[JAMILAH] Oh, my God. 
[LIBBY] Is she crazy? 
Something like that? 
Let's call it a night, ladies. 
Practice this on your own. 
Same time tomorrow. 
Oh, my God. 
[CHUCKLES] 
I totally only drink things 
with "skinny" in the title. 
Like my handy work? 
I built this so you can grab a bottle from anywhere, 
and the rest will redistribute 
without breaking. 
Are you a... Are you a new pledge, or...? Oh, hell, no. 
[JAMILAH LAUGHS] 
You'd have to pay me, like, 12 
Scrooge McDuck gold vaults to pledge SBB, especially with Darth Hater as president. Wow. Duck Tales and a Star Wars 
reference in one sentence. 
What's your name, not pledge? 
Jamilah. 
Jamilah. 
That's Arabic for "beautiful" or "lovely." I'm a former Arabic Studies minor. 
Page 18/63

I wanted to open a ski resort 
in Afghanistan. 
What could go wrong there? 
Kevin. 
So, you just hang out 
in sorority houses, Kevin? 
It's pretty creepy. 
"Darth Hater" is my sister. 
Danielle? 
Nipple. Ass! Bitch. Christ. Crack. Hooters. Spit it at her! 
Danielle? 
- Sorry. Her? 
- Yeah. 
- So, you're adopted? 
- Yeah. 
Sorry I'm late, Kev. 
Somebody ran practice late. 
So, like 20 minutes. 
[JAMILAH GROANS] 
My brother makes very bad decisions when it comes to relationships. 
I like to counsel him 
because I'm an amazing sister 
and an excellent leader. 
I'll be right back. 
- You... 
- Easy. Easy. 
- She touched your hair. 
- Yes, Sharpton. Sharpton! 
We used to bathe together as kids. She gets a pass. 
Good luck with that. 
Thanks for the drink. 
Yep. 
Well, I'm around if you need anything! So, I realized you guys are missing some of the basic cultural building blocks for stepping, 
plus Danielle thinks this is childish. And that gave me an idea. 
This is Deja. This is Alani. 
They're from 40th Street, 
where my sorority volunteers every week. Page 19/63

Why would you be doing community service if you didn't get a DUI? 
The shade is real. 
[ALL] Ooh! 
OK. Show them what you got, ladies. Miss Mary Mack, Mack, Mack 
All dressed in black, black, black With silver buttons, buttons, buttons All down her back, back, back 
OK, fine. That was precious. 
But everybody's played 
"Patty Cake" as a kid. 
Oh, no, no. 
"Patty Cake" is Taylor Swift. 
"Miss Mary Mack" is Beyonc. 
[BETH LAUGHS] 
Partner up. Give it a shot. 
[HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING] 
White, white girl 
White girl 
Hello? 
White, white girl 
[PANTS] 
Come on, sis. 
Don't let the white girl out-rhythm you. Excuse me, young lady. 
Is that how we speak to our elders? - It is in my house. 
- [GASPS] Ooh, I like you. 
- No, she's rude. 
- Hey! Hey, Saundra. 
[BOTH] Ooh! 
You should really 
take this more seriously. 
You have so much potential. 
And you kind of have the most to gain. You're learning something 
to connect to your people. 
No, I'm just saying, 
your life is kind of all white everything. - Being around black culture... 
- I'm sorry. 
Isn't your boyfriend white? 
Much to his dismay, yes. 
Page 20/63
[LAUGHS MOCKINGLY] 
So, I can't be around white people, but you can be all up 
under Iggy Bro-zalea? 
Your hypocrisy bores me. 
Hey! I feel you. I'm a suburban girl, too. I'm just saying, you need that. 
You need to worry about 
your own little life, 
and let me live mine. 
[WHISPERS] 
You are so thoughtful, Jamilah. 
I've got you, girl, anytime. 
You are so smart and brilliant. 
It's so nice to be around people who care. Anytime, girl. High five. 
Beth, you were supposed 
to have our appeal letter drafted. Get your shit together. 
Libby, where are we at with our threat to freeze alumni donations? 
Um... 
[AMBER SNORES] 
Amber, you just sat down. 
[SHOUTS] You cannot possibly be asleep! Sorry! It's $20. 
What is going on here? 
I am the only one trying to fix this. You are all sitting on your tits! If any more SBB business 
falls through the cracks, 
I am pulling the plug 
on this entire step show. 
[JAMILAH] Threats? 
That's bold leadership. 
Um, don't talk when I'm talking, and I'll do the same. 
[IN DITZY ACCENT] 
It's called, like, mutual respect. [IN DITZY ACCENT] 
Is that supposed to be me? 
Moving on, we are completely behind on our community service 
slash fund-raising 
Page 21/63
slash SBB bonding night. 
Speaking of which, if Her Majesty would cede me the floor, I have business. [DANIELLE SIGHS] 
Thank you. Beth and I have been doing some shopping for props and costumes. All in, we're looking at three grand. How much is in 
your special events account? 
We don't have an account. 
Every month, we make a video 
for Libby's daddy, asking him for money. He wires it, 
and then we all go out for a fancy dinner. Oh, and then we give the doggie bags to the homeless people. 
That part was my idea. 
So sweet. 
Very smart. 
- Really fulfilling. 
- Good idea. 
That's your fund-raising? 
- Community service and chapter bonding? - Yeah. 
Ladies, trust me. Raising money yourselves is a lot more rewarding. 
It can even be fun, 
like a karaoke night or something. Oh! 
I love to sing. 
And I'll organize 
a real community service project. No... 
Guys, there is no better feeling than helping people who need it. - It will be great. 
- Downer! 
You are like 
a Sarah McLachlan animal commercial. By the way, can we talk 
about our rehearsal space? 
Stomping on concrete... 
Should I send you my chiropractor bills? Yes, and it's killing our pedis. 
Page 22/63
- And our knees. 
- Uh-huh. 
That's what's killing your knees? You need to get that black widow out of your box, missy! 
- Or else, what? 
- [LIBBY] I'll get it out for you! [ALL] Ooh! 
Hey! 
I'll see what I can do 
about the rehearsal space. 
In the meantime, 
can you guys go five minutes 
without being dicks to each other? We can try. 
I'm so glad I stopped by. 
Well, I'd like to spread the butter, so if anyone's got... 
[DANIELLE] You better not... 
[WOMEN CHATTING] 
[AMBER] I can't believe it's not butter that she bought. 
["JUST WHAT I NEEDED" BY THE CARS PLAYING] I don't mind you coming here 
[WOMEN CONTINUE CHATTING] 
And wasting all my time 
'Cause when you're standing oh so near I kind of lose my mind 
Is this a date? 
- Because it kind of feels like a date. - Uh... no. 
Dates require romance, 
potential longevity, 
actual physical attraction. 
[WAILS] 
I guess you're just what I needed Just what I needed 
[JAMILAH] Oh, God, no. 
[KEVIN WAILS] 
- Don't tell me you like The Cars. - Yes. 
No, the late seventies is about Chaka Khan and Rick James, 
P-Funk. 
Page 23/63
The Cars are so corny. 
Ooh! 
I didn't realize "corny" meant 
"combining punk minimalism, classic rock showmanship and new wave synth." [JAMILAH] Hmm. 
- I'm gonna learn so much from you. - Can I help you guys? 
Three-quarter maple wood 
for a low platform 
and the biggest wall mirrors you have. - It's for step practice. 
- Actually, I've got this. 
[LAUGHS] We just need plywood. 
Right. If you want the wood to warp and break your girls' ankles. 
[EMPLOYEE] He's right, ma'am. 
A platform is safer, 
more stable and hollow, 
so it will echo like a real stage. My girl and I argue like this 
all the time. 
- Yeah. 
- [SCOFFS] Ugh! I am not his girl. - Thanks, bro. 
- [EMPLOYEE] Sorry. 
I have a boyfriend, FYI. 
Why isn't he here buying wood with you? - He's not that good with his hands. - Oh, you know... 
Don't you dare. 
And I didn't mean "ugh." 
I guess you're not that gross. 
- [KEVIN] This is definitely a date. - No, it's not a date.

[BETH] Oh, hi. 
I'm headed to the Pilates class

I've been so "incognegro" lately. [BETH LAUGHS]

I mean, cultural appropriation... I mean, stepping, coming? 
Well, I mean, it started pretty rough, because it's hard. 
- You know? 
- Yeah. 
But we have a pretty sick-ass coach, so... You're not teaching them are you, Jam? Girl, you're crazy. 
Teaching? 
Oh, we're... I'm busy, you know. Page 26/63

- OK.

they find time to practice, 
with all the tanning sessions 
and blow-drying... 
Girl, when was the last time you left the house without your edges laid? Cheryl? No. I didn't send for you. - It's the wrong time... 
- We should run. 
Because we don't want our FitBits judging us tonight. 
Because we want to be more like... OK. Ooh! Oh no, girl. You're mad sweaty. You know I don't do sweat. 
- I glow. 
- I forgot.

What do you have, 
an exam on that comic book? 
I didn't know you liked zombies. Campus is all abuzz about 
these white girls stepping next week. - Are they excited? 
- Depends on the skin tone. 
Seems to be a direct correlation between pigmentation and indignation. Great. So, my college legacy will be... Auntie Tom, the sell-out house Negress. [KEVIN] Let's postpone your pity party. OK, my sister tells me you guys are doing a karaoke fund-raiser?

I'd like to formally request 
sobriety tests for all those young ladies, because there's no way they came out here and did that sober. 
And then the girl fell at the end. What did she trip on? Life?

I'm pulling their charter. 
- Dean Berman, wait... 
- I can see the hashtags already. # BlackSteppersMatter. 
# SteppersSoWhite. 
- We're lucky we didn't have a race riot. - You're overreacting. Shocker. 
Please be patient. I promise 
I will show you what SBB is capable of. It didn't work. It's over, Bishop. Let's go. 
I am so not in the mood to socialize. Wow. It's come to this, huh? 
Cowering to avoid your own betrayal? [WHISPERS] OK, you are being super judgy. Sorry, "super judgy"? 
Jesus, you're becoming one of them. Page 38/63

Don't forget you had a brain 
before these Beckys turned you. 
Oh, what, you actually care about SBB? Enough to help, yeah. 
This is serious. 
You've abetted the latest cultural theft. Well, get ready for white, 
WASP-y step shows to sweep the nation. Blond ponytails swinging, 
stomping off beat... 
What's up, brother? 
Catch you later. Good looks. 
Now whitey can add stepping 
to the long list of things 
we've stolen from black culture, including jazz, rock and roll, 
those beaded vacation cornrows. 
OK, that is on you, Slugworth. 
We need to break up. 
No, we don't need to break up. I got us tickets to the New Edition reunion tour. Dane, you're never on my side. 
I didn't see it before 
because you look great on paper. You're smart, handsome, 
you don't have that weird white-boy smell. White-boy smell? 
It's like old leather couch and wet dog and hair gel and... 
It doesn't matter. 
I'm done being proof 
of how liberal you are. 
That's what your Prius is for. 
Beaded vacation cornrows? 
Really? 
[SOFT ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] 
Well, I guess we all know 
who's responsible for all this. 
- Dean Berman? 
- Miss Libby. 
Enough with the slut-shaming. 
What are you, a virgin? 
Yes. I'm a Catholic. 
- Stop fighting.

- The white girls crashed and burned. The ones who were there 
when the show started? 
They did just fine. 
It's a shame that I was the only one who took this seriously. 
[AMBER] Are you kidding me? 
[SHOUTING] 
Stop! Stop! 
This is a shit show! 
Right? We would have been fine if you had showed up on time... No! I'm talking about your sorority! Nobody respects you guys 
because you don't respect each other. There is zero sisterhood here. Danielle, why did you choose 
these girls at rush? 
Why did you choose Amber? 
Because I knew if we ever needed help dropping and-or popping it, 
we'd have an instructor. 
What about my face 
is giving you joke time? 
She was a tough broad. 
In a campus full of girly-girls, I thought... 
well, here is this badass chick who's wicked smart, 
sees through bullshit, 
and plays by her own rules. 
I respected that. 
[JAMILAH] OK. 
What about Saundra? 
Saundra's... 
unique. 
And fashionable. 
She had a bad experience 
with another sorority. 
I knew their loss was our gain. OK. This is great. And Libby? 
- Her father's very wealthy. 
- Come on. 
I don't know! 
Page 40/63

She's... 
like an innocent little redneck. That's not a compliment. That hurt. No, no. I knew that other houses would try to turn her into a New Yorker. She needed a place where she could let her confederate flag fly. 
Uh-uh. No. 
- Not literally. 
- [SAUNDRA] Not at all. 
And me? 
I know saying nice things about me gives you the squirts, 
but you're kind of on a roll. 
You were an insurance policy. 
I knew that... 
if I ever had a bad day for the rest of my time during college... 
that you'd be there to cheer me up. Your positivity is as infectious as it is nauseating. 
Thank you. 
Eyelashes are gonna pop off. 
Oh, my God, you guys. 
There's real love here. 
You've got to use it. 
This doesn't have to be the end. There's a way that you guys 
can prove to the Greeks 
and the rest of the school - 
hell, to yourselves - 
that you are some badass, 
stepping-ass bitches. 
That you are a real sorority 
and a force to be reckoned with. How can we do that? 
We donate $100,000 
to the 40th Street Community Center. It's Dean Berman's favorite charity. All we have to do... 
is win Steptacular. 
It's the regional step show 
I told you about. 
First prize is a hundred grand. Page 41/63

We didn't even place 
at a student step show. 
- How are we gonna win at a regional one? - You choked because your teamwork sucked. Trust me, if you get that back, 
if you build up the sisterhood, 
I promise you have a real shot. 
I say, hell yeah. I mean, all in favor? Excuse me. I am the president. 
I will conduct the votes. 
Look, we had a good run. 
Let's just quit while we're ahead. For the record, when this goes to shit, I told you so. 
- Yeah. 
- Yeah. 
[SBB CHATTERING] 
[BETH] I love you. You're the best. [AMBER] Sometimes... 
- Cheers. 
- [BETH] She loves us. 
[JAMILAH] Hey. 
- Hi. 
- Leaving after one drink? 
Are you sure you're an SBB? 
I know, right? 
Nah, I've got to go. 
- But thanks. 
- Oh, OK. 
Hey, Beth. 
- Can I borrow your phone? 
- You bet. 
[CELL PHONE BEEPING] 
Thanks. Good night. 
Hey. 
Want to chat? 
When you bounce from foster home to foster home, a... 
a sorority feels like a stable family. I didn't tell the girls because 
I didn't want to be an SBB charity case. Yeah, but stripping? 
Why not just bartend at Fleck's like Beth? I make a thousand dollars a night. 
Page 42/63
Are they hiring? 
I'm sorry you've been 
going through all this. 
What, you think white girls 
can't struggle? 
The struggle is real. 
Please tell me your stripper name. Bob. 
[JAMILAH] OK, this is a teamwork exercise. Your arms will stay linked up, 
no matter what. 
Your sisterhood is your bond. 
Do not let it break. 
Not ready! I'm not ready! Oh, my God! - [DANIELLE] Oh, Libby! 
- I'm sorry. I got so scared. 
You need to look nasty... 
Furious. Demonic. This is your haka. [SHOUTS] This is your war cry. 
[SCREAMING] 
- [JAMILAH] Guys! 
- [DANIELLE] That was aggressive. [SHOUTS] Scare them broads 
off your island. 
Because this... This is your island. - Yeah! 
- Yeah! 
SBB Island! 
[SBB CHANT LOUDLY] SBB Island! 
SBB Island! 
- SBB Island! 
- Come on! 
[BETH GRUNTS] 
[SCREAMING] 
[RHO BETA MU GUY] 
Can I get an "ugly" on three? 
- One, two, three. 
- [SBB] Ugly! 
Alright! 
[SCREAMING] 
[DANIELLE YELLS] We're bonding here! Get him! Get his nuts! 
[JAMILAH] No, guys! No! No biting! Word on the street is that you sent 
Page 43/63
White Malcolm X packing. 
Should I believe the streets? 
- You can this time. 
- [KEVIN] Perfect. 
Because I have planned 
possibly the sickest date 
in the history of courtship. 
But it's time sensitive, 
so we should get going. 
OK, I'll just go change. 
No need. 
You won't be wearing that outfit for long. Presumptuous. 
- And dead wrong. 
- Not like that. 
It's just, 
the best date ever requires... 
a little wardrobe change. 
[HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING] 
Well played, Harris. 
Very original. 
[KEVIN] Yeah. 
So... 
What are your Theta girls gonna say now that you're out of the nerd closet? This is not an image I plan on projecting to my Thetas. 
You know, it's like there's this awesome chick inside you, right? But then on the surface, 
it's like work, success, motivation... You wouldn't understand. 
- You have white parents. 
- What is that... 
Bougie black parents are tough. Perfect black girls did not read comic books. I had to steal them from my guy friends. I don't know. 
It's like I got so good at doing exactly what I was supposed to do that... it didn't really leave time 
to find a passion. 
You could always be a zombie slayer. Relax. 
Page 44/63

You'll figure it out. 
It's that simple, huh? 
It can be. 
So, why are you single? 
Uh... 
Every girl I tried to date 
was crazy, flaky, 
and in the last case, 
a lesbian. 
I feel her pain. 
Me too. 
So... 
Actually, 
I have a confession to make. 
I am... 
sane, 
I'm dependable 
and mostly... 
heterosexual.

I'm from Kappa next door. 
You shook our house. 
We lost a row of 
totally irreplaceable shot glasses. Hello? I was talking to you! 
I think you're ready. 
What? 
[BETH SQUEALS] 
[DANIELLE] Oh, my God. 
I need a shower now. 
[AMBER] My boobs are sweaty. 
[JAMILAH] Hey. 
What's up, ladies? 
Well, this is one lame surprise party. Mom? 
Soror Yvonne. 
I am not calling you "Soror Yvonne." Did you violate the sanctity 
of our sisterhood? 
Have you betrayed all of your black, Page 45/63

Greek brothers and sisters? 
Those are very abstract questions. Oh, so you think this is funny? 
Well, let me remind you. 
Our organizations were founded 
to create community where there was none, built upon sisterhood, 
in a world that did not welcome us. And over a hundred years, 
we have stood the test of time. 
This is your fault! 
- My... 
- Yes! You and Dad screwed me with Harvard. This has nothing to do with family. Well, I didn't start this conversation, and I damn sure didn't send for you. Sorry it's not going the way you planned, Soror Yvonne. 
You do not deserve to wear our letters. You lied to my face. 
We don't get down with you anymore, so when you see us around... 
keep walking. 
- Aisha... 
- [AISHA] I don't care. 
Why don't you just run to the SBBs? They're not your sorors. 
They're not your friends. 
You're the help. 
That's how those bitches look at you. And that's how 
they will always look at you. 
Actions have consequences, Jamilah. Why don't you just step? 
[DOOR SHUTTING] 
When you took this job, 
I told you that 
even though you're still a student, you represent this office. 
Of course. 
Then why am I seeing these? 
[JAMILAH] Oh... 
God. Oh. 
I wasn't in the twerk pyramid. 
Page 46/63

- God. 
- What were you thinking? 
- I know this looks really bad... - I'm sorry. I have to fire you. And Nick and I can't endorse you to Harvard. 
Not now. 
[SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] 
[MUTED CHANTING] 
[ECHOING] Yo, Jam. What do you think? [LIBBY] Jamilah? 
What's wrong, honey? 
I got fired. 
What? 
- What happened? 
- No! 
Dean Berman found pictures of me partying here, with you guys, 
and I'm an employee, so... 
So we're gonna do something about this. - Like what? 
- I don't know. Give me 40 seconds. - I don't have these things chambered. - Wait, how did he get the pictures? Aisha. 
- What? 
- She did not! 
SBB isn't the only sorority 
with internal drama. 
Yeah, but you're not gonna 
beez out on us, right? 
[JAMILAH] Um... 
Listen, guys, I... 
I only have one class left, 
and I can finish it online. 
So... 
So I'm gonna go back to Philly 
and figure out my next move. 
- What? We're not done choreographing. - Steptacular is ten days away. 
What are we supposed to do 
without our captain? 
Danielle is your captain. 
It will be fine. You guys know this stuff. Page 47/63

You don't have a job. 
Just stay with us until Steptacular. - I really can't. 
- This is bullshit. 
I don't have time for this, you guys! I have spent every minute on SBB. - Now, I have no job, my sorors hate me... - And that's our fault? 
My life was perfect before coaching SBB. This is obviously 
the worst mistake I've made. 
Wow. 
You spout out this sisterhood shit, and then you bail when we need you? What was in it for you? 
So you and the Thetas could just laugh at a bunch of dumb white girls? 
- Hello! We're not all white girls. - To get closer to my brother? 
To boost your resume for Harvard? Was... 
Was it for Harvard? 
Harvard? 
Yeah, Jamilah wants to go to Harvard Law. And Dean Berman is an alum. 
And so, what? 
You worked out a deal that 
if you tame some crazy white girls, he'd put in a good word? 
I figured everybody wins. 
I get to go to law school, 
your charter is safe, 
the community center gets money. [AMBER] You know what? 
You're an asshole. 
And I am done with you. 
You're a goddam phony. 
Freshman year, 
I went to a Theta informational meeting. My mother and my grandmother, 
they're both Thetas. 
But you guys rejected me 
because I was too whitewashed. 
I didn't realize. 
Page 48/63
It's fine. 
I dodged a bullet. 
SBB is not perfect. 
But at least we judge on actions and not stereotypes. 
We're better off without you... sis. 
Long-distance things 
don't work all the time. 
Neither do airbags. 
I just have to do what's best for me. Only problem is just that 
you have no idea what that is. 
[TIRES SQUEALING] 
[GASPS] 
[JAMILAH] What the... 
OK. 
You messed with the wrong bitch today! What the hell is wrong with you? I thought you were a crazy person. Obviously, I was right. 
I sent the pictures to Dean Berman. [TASER CRACKLING] 
I thought you'd get into a little trouble and we could bail on Steptacular, and I could get SBB back in order. I was trying to protect Kevin! 
I do not believe this shit! 
After everything I did for you? In all fairness, you did it for yourself. Actually, it was me. It was me! It was all me! 
[TASER CRACKLING] 
[WHISPERS] You are so pretty. 
[TASER STOPS CRACKLING] 
Please come back. 
[TASER CRACKLES] 
SBB needs you. 
You may not actually be an SBB, but you're still one of our sisters. I was your coach! 
Your... 
Your friend. 
Not your sister. 
Page 49/63

It doesn't work like that. 
I thought Steptacular was a bad idea from the beginning. I admit it. 
But the girls really want to do it... together. 
Please, stay. 
Help us be better sisters. 
YOU SAID IT YOURSELF: there's no better feeling than helping people who need it. I... 
am not... 
the help! 
I'm pretty sure I said, "Keep walking," yet here you are. 
I came to say goodbye. 
And to apologize. 
I screwed up. 
Just for fun, you know, come in. Come in. I'd love to hear this, just for fun. How did you screw up? 
[SIGHS] 
- I lied to you. 
- Uh-huh. 
And I bailed on SBB. 
And... 
I disappointed my parents. 
You know what? Take that off the list. That doesn't bother me. 
Do you even hear yourself? 
Those are all the same problem. 
You're a user. 
I am not a user. 
You used SBB and Dean Berman 
to get into Harvard. 
And to be honest, Jamilah, 
I always thought you've been 
using Theta for years 
to prove how black you are. 
OK. 
Yeah. 
I did. 
I joined a black sorority 
because I wanted people 
to stop calling me "white girl" or "Oreo." Page 50/63

I admit that was the wrong reason. You have to understand. I... 
I love Theta. I love my sorors. You let them take stepping from us. Aisha, white people said the same thing about Tiger Woods 
and the Williams sisters. 
We said the same thing about Eminem. Races can't own things. 
I give up.

Listen. 
I don't have a job, or a man,

But I'm here 
because I believe you guys can win. So, either prove me wrong, 
or get your asses in gear, 
because we have a step show in one week. You never took off your workout clothes. - Alright, alright. 
- [BETH] Thank you. 
Page 51/63
[JAMILAH] Alright. 
I know you missed me. 
Hey. 
Listen. 
Theta missed out. 
You'd have been a great soror. 
But I'll settle for a friend. 
Let's win, sis.

Hey, can I talk to you for a second? It's Kevin. 
I haven't seen him this upset 
SINCE THEY CANCELED STAR TREK: Voyager. Is he sad about me? 
Or is he sad that his sister 
tried to sabotage his girlfriend? - I said the "G" word. 
- Yeah, you did. 
Do you think he'd talk to me? 
Get out of here. 
Yes, ma'am.

And wasting all my time 
'Cause when you're standing oh so near I kind of lose my mind... 
Look, Kevin. 
I've always been good at everything. Very little in life has challenged me. I had a clear image of my perfect guy, and it looked nothing like you. 
- Why are your apologies so mean? - No! You don't look bad. 
You look great, 
beautiful, 
tall and handsome, 
and your teeth are so white. 
Your skin is so smooth and soft, like a baby, and it's hairless. 
I have no idea how you do it. 
And you're just like... 
You're a goofball. 
You play video games online 
with 12-year-olds. 
- I'm about to ask you to leave because... - Hey, I'm trying to be corny here. I realize that Harvard 
is what my parents wanted. 
Well, what do you want? 
I don't know. 
But I know I want you. 
I know I want to give us another shot. What do you say? 
That I'm never gonna be a six-foot-four football-playing lawyer 
who knows all the lyrics to old

And that's who you always wanted, so go... Go find him and... 
Hey. 
Actually... 
don't find that guy.
