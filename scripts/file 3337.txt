The thing I love most about

Valentine's Day is the expectation of the unexpected.

That something magical could happen.

And maybe that special

someone will come back into your life and

change its course for the better.

Hey Milwaukee, Valentine's Day is

here and we're spreading the love right here on

WTMC 95.9.

Whether you're

planning a romantic night out or

wanna show someone how much

they mean to you, we've got you covered.

Keep it locked on WTMC 95.9.

Frontier realty, I want a home for you.

Ash, it's Marv.

I just got to the Emerald Springs house.

Someone drew a

Hitler mustache on my yard sign.

Hitler, can you believe that?

Have some dignity.

It's gotta be Jeff's

accent, P point messing with me.

I have half a mind of gold.

And do what Marv?

Couple of dinner?

The guy has like a black belt.

He could crush you with his thumb.

Yeah, anything going on at the office?

Only the office Valentine's Day party.

If one streamer falls on my desk,

I will stop it so far up your as*h*le.

You will be sh**ting hearts.

I will m*rder you.

Wow, someone's in a good mood.

I really, I don't

think I can do this anymore Marv.

Do what anymore?

All of it, you know?

Work, live.

It's so f*cking bleak.

You know, and I feel, I feel sick.

You're not sick Ash, you're depressed.

I get it.

It's very natural to

feel lonely on Valentine's Day.

Look, every day is an

opportunity to change your life.

If you're not

happy, do something about it.

I really don't need a

bumper sticker right now Marv, please.

I'm serious.

You've got a chef's

kitchen, top of the line appliances,

a beautiful space for

those big family breakfasts.

You know, I remember the

feeling when I bought my home.

It was like for the first time in

my life, something was truly all mine.

There was a freedom in that, you know?

Even if it's just a little taste.

You want to know my

favorite part about my job?

I get to relive that

experience, that first feeling of freedom,

again and again, from

good folks like yourselves.

It's why I want a home for you.

It's simple.

I pour everything into

it because it's meaningful.

And because it's

meaningful, I have meaning.

If you find

something you love, go after it.

What do you love Marv?

The job, of course.

Oh, God, that's sad.

Cookie? No.

Ash, I'm your boss, which

means you have to listen to me.

Hey Deborah, Cookie?

I'd love a cookie, thanks Marv.

Toby, hey! Great to see you, Cookie.

Cookie alert.

Hey Jamie.

Okay, speaking about bosses,

Cliff came by looking for you earlier?

Yeah, he say why?

No, he's in a meeting back in a while.

Hey, come on, Cookie.

Well, so the Rebers called

about the Emerald Springs house.

There's such freaks.

But they want to take a look at it.

Great schedule.

After today's open house, I

think it's going to be competitive.

Yeah.

Looks like

someone's got a secret admirer.

Who's it from?

Marv, are you alright?

I'm not feeling great all of a sudden.

I just need a minute.

Yeah, don't forget the office party.

The animal breathes again.

And for once I'm glad to see these bars.

These bars that keep me from myself.

That keep me from you.

I pass you rocks, you tip the scales.

You grind me salt, I cut your nails.

Raven?

What did you think of that last answer?

What?

The last answer.

Was the imagery too obtuse?

I think he can do better.

Your brother Knuckles wants to know

why Rose is spreading love on Valentine's Day.

He wants to see her.

Where is she?

I have no idea.

I'm told you watched

her draw her last breath.

And yet, she breathes again.

I told you, I don't know.

Your co-workers don't

know who you really are, do they?

And I'm willing to

keep your dirty little secret.

If you tell me

exactly what I want to know.

Where is Rose?

I know you have just two.

And it's not just the

cinnamon hearts I've been eating either.

You're a little rusty, Gable.

Oh, fudge.

I want a friend to your

realty. I want a home for you.

No, the house is two

stories. We can't remove one.

Thanks.

Hey, you all good, buddy?

I'm in the middle of a high

intensity yoga. Can you give me a minute?

Yeah, of course.

Listen to me. Tell Knuckles

I don't know where she is. Okay?

Not okay.

Gable, you're the man I'm looking

for. God damn, son. You have looked better.

Come on, Miles. I want to talk to you.

You have won the regional

realtor of the year. You did it.

Congratulations. I want

to come down and tell you myself.

I know how hard

you've been busting your tail.

Cliff.

Man, you come a

long way. I'm proud of you.

Thank you. This is, um...

This means a lot to me. I'm overwhelmed.

When we first met, you were

a man of drift. Now look at you.

I mean, you just keep getting after it.

Harvin.

Ah, sorry. Can I borrow

your car? My bike, it's not working.

Yeah, sure. It's yours.

Whoa, we're hugging. We're hugging.

You've taught me so

much, Cliff. I just want

you to know that.

You've been a great mentor.

You changed my life.

Harvin, you can't change a

man who doesn't want to be changed.

I'll grab the car later.

Crazy for you, my a*s.

Well, I got your panties in a bunch.

You ever gonna

move? You been there all day.

How wifey doing? What y'all

got planned for Valentine's Day?

She, uh, kicked me out again.

Man, get the f*ck off

the block. Is you serious?

Yeah.

Damn. She said that

I'm emotionally constipated.

Love Bug.

That's what you

used to call me, all right?

Yeah, whatever. f*cking love bug.

f*cking love bug.

Look, maybe you should call

her and apologize for being so...

Being so constipated. You know?

Yeah, maybe you should eat my whole a*s.

Maybe I should beat your whole a*s.

Maybe you should try to do that.

You know what, m*therf*cker?

That's what I might f*cking actually do.

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

Is that him?

What?

Hey, yo, Merlot. That

boy gave him on the move, fella.

Well, that's weird, man.

And he's probably

gonna meet up with Rose.

All right. Follow

him and find f*cking Rose.

And you know what to do.

I'll keep Knuckles in the dark.

f*cking Valentine's!

Knuckles?

My interrupting.

Sir?

The Raven's not answering his phone.

The Raven? Wait, is

this about the Valentine's cards?

Yes.

It's Rose's handwriting, okay?

That, I know.

About f*cking time.

That's why I sent the Raven.

I thought we agreed to

handle the Rose situation in the house.

So why hire the Raven too?

That the money that

she stole has been recovered.

She was a hell of a

lawyer for the organization.

And now she's just a loose end.

And we sure as

hell don't need the Raven--

She's alive and bad.

She could f*ck everything up.

She knows who's money that really was.

She's f*cking with us right now.

All these g*dd*mn Valentine cards.

Our idea of a game.

I need to find out

why Marvin didn't k*ll her.

And decide if I'm gonna k*ll her again.

Decide?

I mean, she stole from you.

We shouldn't

hesitate to k*ll her on sight.

Even--

I said I want her alive.

Happy m*therf*cking Valentine's Day.

Looks like love is--

Marvin Gaye.

Yeah.

Who are you?

It's King and I'm Otis.

Yeah, we work with your

brother and his right hand man,

Renny Merlo.

They brought us in after

your little, uh, career change.

Damn, I thought your a*s

would be a little more scarier.

But look, your

place here, it inspires me.

If a has-been k*ller

like yourself can, you know,

score a sweet

little civilian life like this,

maybe it's hope for me and O.

What you think?

You think I got a shot at?

Anything's possible.

I owe you credit.

I'm not great at it, huh?

Little funny guy, huh?

One.

Now look, you

bleeding just a little bit too much

for a m*therf*cker

who don't know nothing.

I think that you've got a little too much

for a guy who isn't running away.

Okay?

Time to listen, little man.

Listen.

Yeah.

Listen.

Where is Rose?

I don't know.

Come on, man.

Should've just told us what we got.

Now where is Rose

and why did you not k*ll her?

What are you doing?

Hmm?

What are you doing? I just opened that.

So where? This f*cking soda.

You tripping. f*ck, I

thought we could share it.

Could you ask?

f*ck. Oh, please forgive me.

Of course we can share it.

f*ck that. I'm on it.

Ooh, I got it. I got

to get your a*s over here.

Come here.

Damn.

Watch this. Watch this.

Tap team.

All right, hold on. Your

turn. Your turn. Your turn. Your turn.

Damn. I'm getting out.

Oh, f*ck.

Why?

Come here.

Oh, sh*t.

Get your roll.

Oh, f*ck.

What the f*ck? What the f*ck is that?

Ready?

Get your a*s in it.

Damn.

Watch this. Oh, watch this. Oh.

sh*t. I'm here.

Get him. Oh, f*ck you.

Come on. Come on.

Oh, sh*t.

Okay. Okay.

Don't think

you're so f*cking cool now.

Hey, where wrong

is that, you little f*ck?

Huh?

f*ck. Hey, that

could have been your head.

Tell my brother to back off.

I'm not telling your brother sh*t.

You know what? I'm

gonna tail your little a*s.

What the--

How the f*ck can I get this--

this really stuck?

This little

m*therf*cker spider monkey ninja guy.

Hey, Marv.

Rose?

What the f*ck--

I'm gonna go tomorrow.

Hello?

Hey.

Do you have an

appointment with Mr. Gable?

Mm-mm.

Mr. Knuckle, I am not answering that.

My blades are quiet, sharp, and clean.

They cut through life unseen.

No echo follows, no scream, no cry.

Just stealing flesh as I pass by.

Did you find her?

Man, we just got

that sh*t beat out of us.

Morv--and Rose got away.

f*ck.

This is so f*cked up, seriously.

This m*therf*cker

just a little bit too crazy.

And me and Owen signed up for this sh*t.

King, listen to me very carefully.

Okay, if she is taken alive,

she will tell Knuckle

everything that Kivy fixed the books

and I stole the

f*cking money, and we're all dead.

You guys are idiots.

I will find Rose

myself and f*cking k*ll her.

And I'll text you the address

so you can clean up

what is left of her, okay?

Oh, and find Kivy, okay?

I mean, he has been returning my calls,

and that bastard knows everything,

and the fucker talks too much.

All right, man, f*ck.

Oh.

All right, my boy.

Oh.

What am I wearing?

Hi, you've reached

Marvin Gable at Frontier Realty.

So sorry I missed your

call, but leave me a message,

and I'll get back

to you as soon as I can.

I want a home for you.

Hey.

It's--it's me.

Um...

There's a dead poet in your office.

Maybe you know that.

Maybe you don't.

Yeah, funny, Rose.

I need you to hear one of his poems.

It's called...

"The Dancing Bear."

My dancing bear.

Sometimes prancing bear.

So silent, so graceful.

Do you have any wisdom for me

as you sway so charmingly

inside your cage, upon your stage?

You move out here, the chains are thick.

Out here, the ringmasters are sick.

There's gray bars in the

way or so, you know, fitting.

So...

I always had a sense

that Rose might try to come back.

She had the guts to stand up to anyone.

Even my brother Knuckles.

He tried to k*ll her once,

but I interfered because I love her.

Even though she would

never look twice at a guy like me.

Oh, he does look cute in that sweater.

I mean, look at

him. He's kind, he's smart.

He is a badass, but...

he has to face his past

so we can get our lives back.

Consider this my resignation, Marv.

I just can't dance anymore.

No one's ever...

Will!

Understood my words before.

How?

No one's words have

ever understood me before.

Hey, Andy. You left the bar?

Well, I really hate that you shaved.

You were the one...

That is our nice touch.

The very Clark Kent.

I got you out.

What do you want, Rose?

A secured outcome no matter the cost.

Exactly what outcome?

I want my life back,

and I need you to help me.

That's all.

Your life back? Why now?

Well, why not? It's Valentine's Day.

I sent the whole

g*ng these cute little cards.

I learned calligraphy and everything.

You think this is a joke? What a danger.

Okay, relax. This

isn't Knuckles' territory.

You are safe.

We are safe.

We're not safe anywhere.

Do you have any idea what you have done?

You need to run tonight.

Oh, because that's how

you deal with Knuckles, right?

Running away?

I know exactly what I've done.

And I know exactly what I'm doing.

Goodbye, Rose.

Marvin, this is it.

It's now...

or never.

And I need your help.

Hey, hey, hey. I know you.

You're not the father's name.

No, it's you.

Your eyes, man. Your f*cking bedshads.

I see your face everywhere I go.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry everyone.

I'll give you a ride.

All right, Andy,

can you get Reggie some ice?

I was pleasantly

surprised to find this in your pocket.

Amethyst.

One of the best

protections against nightmares.

I'm the one who gave

it to you. Why'd you keep it?

I'm the sentimental type.

I know. I love that about you.

Come on. Let's go.

Who is that?

Look, you are being paranoid.

You saved my word.

Well, yeah. You can

barely pry it out of your hands.

Slow down, could you?

Marvin, I know, likes to go fast.

Oops.

Boop.

Rose?

Mm-hmm?

What the heck are you doing?

I want to see the real you, right now.

This is the real me.

You know, the guy's gone.

I barely came out in the pool.

No, no, no. I saw you in the bar, babes.

You wanted to hurt that guy.

Marvin, come out.

Please stop. Please stop.

You are--

f*cking stop!

There he is.

The fear I feel has

little to do with death.

For we all die.

And everything to do with not... living.

Your observations?

You...

write about death a lot.

And k*lling.

That's who I am.

That's what I know.

Am I in danger?

From me?

No.

I'm the one in danger.

Of what?

Falling.

It's one of my

listings of the cellar this week.

Pulling to the garage.

You here?

Do this sh*t.

Bros.

I like it here.

Feels good.

It's got a great layout.

A lot of space. Good life.

What?

Nothing.

You're cute.

There are rooms upstairs if you're tired.

What's your whole

deal with this thing, anyway?

After I left Knuckles, I

honestly didn't think I could be normal.

There's proof I can.

I've changed, Rose.

No, you haven't.

You're just hiding.

What are you doing, Rose?

Are you crazy?

I didn't come here to hide.

Hey, I worked hard to get to where I am.

And because of you, I

lost everything in one day.

Oh, I know exactly how

that feels, Marvin. Exactly.

Why couldn't you just stay dead, Rose?

Because it's humiliating.

No name, no truth.

You got nothing. You're nobody.

I'm nobody.

Hiding ain't living.

But if you want to live to see next week,

you'll run far away

and never see face again.

Well, I already did that.

Now I'm trying something new.

Now I'm trying something different.

How far would you

go to get your life back?

I already did.

Follow me. I gotta show you something.

No.

Look in the mirror.

f*ck face.

Kippy.

Why is Knuckles accounting a drunk?

It's all part of the plan.

Where is his finger?

Marvin, you are not listening.

I told you I want my life

back, and I'll do what it f*cking takes.

He's cutting off his finger, Rose.

Do you realize what a

dangerous game you're playing?

Look, I need a fingerprint.

Look at that.

It's his dental caps.

I'll be needing those back.

Hello, Mom.

All right.

Now I want to know what you

and Merlot got out of setting me up.

Three years ago, I

helped Merlot steal $4 million.

Of that sweet Russian money.

Money you...

were going to hide by cooking the

books, so Knuckles would never miss it.

Which, by the way, he didn't.

Because you fools put it in

the trunk of my car for him to find.

Now...

I'm a smart girl.

I can think of a few reasons

why you'd want me out of the picture.

But why, why, why

risk being k*lled stealing

money from Knuckles

just to give it all back to him?

Now that just doesn't make sense.

It's easy.

We had no intention of keeping the money.

Merlot wanted your

position as Knuckles' right hand.

Oh.

He was willing to risk it all.

And the $2 million

in the boot of your car,

well, that was enough

to put you six feet under.

Don't waste my time, Kippy.

You want to lose another finger?

Okay, okay.

Merlot has it.

He paid me for fixing

the books and took the rest.

f*cking Merlot.

He set me up.

Mm. Yeah, I think so, yeah.

Framed me and kept the

other $2 million for himself.

So, Marv...

You did drive me to a

quarry and leave me for dead.

I made Knuckles a

fortune, laundering money

from the Russians,

but as you know, I wanted out.

Marvin?

Stealing money with

Merlot was never a good idea.

You don't have to

do this. We can still go.

Of course that m*therf*cker framed me.

Rose Carlyle is dead. Don't come back.

The rule of the company is

if you steal from Knuckles, you die.

But you broke that rule.

Marv.

And defied your brother.

No.

And I'm so grateful.

But I just gotta ask.

Did you know they were setting me up?

I didn't know, okay?

You didn't know?

Yeah, I know!

I knew you were a

thief. I knew you were a liar.

And I knew my brother wanted you dead.

Oh, so you just volunteered for the job?

Yeah.

I didn't do it. Someone

else would have. You'd be gone.

And I knew if I took the job, it

was the only chance I had to save you.

I didn't want to

imagine a world without you.

On Russians.

She was there all by herself.

Valentine's Day, right?

It's not my f*cking day.

m*therf*cker took a swing at me.

Here.

What the f*ck is that?

Gotta for sending you to Valentine's.

That's why we made this f*cking stop.

Bruh, it's simple.

Ain't no fake a*s

made-in-shri-lanka teddy

bear gonna help you

get your f*cking wife back.

Get your f*cking mind together, my boy.

Oh, get a m*therf*cker

his bear back and let's go.

We gotta go clean up after Merlot.

Marvin?

What in the hell?

Marvin, you here?

I'm here to pick up the car.

Your front door's wide open.

Oh, uh...

Hi.

I'm Alvin. My friends call me Knuckles.

Cliff Cusick, howdy.

Ah, my brother's savior.

You're the one he spends

Thanksgiving with now, right?

Yeah.

Hey, Marvin comes over to Thanksgiving.

He's family.

I'm sorry, you have to

forgive me. I'm a little, uh, surprised.

Marvin never mentioned that he had a...

brother.

Jake?

No, uh...

You're not gonna have one?

I still got a little bit left.

Well, thank you, Kendall.

But where is he?

I mean, I haven't seen Marvin since

he left work and he wasn't looking too good.

What a considerate boss.

Yeah. He's family, I

told you. He's my brother.

I gotta be honest with you, Cliff.

It hurts my feelings

that Marvin never mentioned me.

Oh, well, maybe he did.

My memory's not like it used to be.

You wanna feel better?

Marvin never told me he'd play baseball.

Oh, I can assure you, Cliff,

there's a lot Marvin didn't tell you.

Rose is right. I am hiding.

I allowed my brother to turn

me into someone I never wanted to be.

I could take you to

at least a dozen holes in

the old quarry that

Marvin filled with bodies.

He was such a...

beautiful, beautiful monster.

I love you, Nick.

But I controlled it.

He was obedient, did what I said, always.

And when I unleashed him...

I could take you to the last hole.

But all you'd find is a hole.

Because apparently, he

fell in love and found a conscience.

Ever see her around?

No, sir, I don't believe I have.

You sure?

She seems like the kind

of woman a man would remember.

I don't know if Marvin

understands I'm here to save him.

Just like he saved me.

We have to face

Knuckles to be truly free, and...

I don't wanna do it without him.

God damn, Alvin.

Those are some big words.

And I gotta be honest, I...

I don't know that much

about the world you're talking about.

I'm not naive

enough to know there's gonna be

anything I can say in

this room right now that's gonna...

change my fate.

And I'll tell you what.

I believe in absolution.

I believe in second chances.

The difference between...

bodies and holes...

and families and holes...

is pretty big.

Maybe too big.

Knuckles only set me free

because I promised to k*ll Rose.

Now he will never stop hunting us.

I know I have to

face my past to be truly free.

But God damn it...

I love this new life.

From the minute he

started selling homes for me...

he was working like he

was making up for something.

You know what?

I think I will take that drink.

And when push comes to shove...

Marvin's gonna be alright.

You're a wise man, Cliff.

But...

Marvin only has one brother.

Oh. Morning, Marv.

Pinky-less. Oh.

Mm-hmm.

Oh, yeah. I appreciate that.

I gotta say, a lot of

intrigue with this whole money situation.

Proper f*cking quagmire.

Mello and I thought we were real

smart when we set up Rose the way we did.

Knuckles still doesn't know we

stole more than what he found in Rose's trunk.

But you know the rule.

If you steal from Knuckles...

you die.

f*ck me, man.

I would not like to be you when

your brother finds out Rose is here.

He finds out?

Not that he will. I

mean, I won't say anything. No.

But I tell you what.

A little bit of hush money.

Might just put both of our minds at ease.

Why are you shutting the doors?

You know what I used

to do for my brother, right?

My job.

Yeah, of course. Everyone knew.

But you don't do that anymore.

Well, Kibby, you're not

giving him much of a choice.

No!

f*ck.

Mr. Weber's. Marvin?

Don't open that door.

Please. I love this life.

Hiding ain't living.

Morning, Marvin.

Jerry, good morning.

What happened to your hand now, buddy?

I'm fine. Back

accident. Have you made a decision?

Well, we thought about this.

They don't hold hands.

We want this home from you!

Living room.

Every time. It's so welcoming.

It's me.

Yeah, I know. Where are

you? What is going on? Are you okay?

I'm fine. Listen.

Did you get my message?

No. Why?

Um, I just... I quit, is all.

Again?

I'm not happy. I need a change, Martin.

Can you quit later? I need you to

bring me the papers to the Emerald Springs house.

Wait. Right now?

Yes. Right now.

The weaver is out

here and they want to buy.

Yeah. Um, I just... I

don't think that I should.

Ashley, it's important.

Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine.

Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine.

Where is he?

sh*t!

Okay.

Are these the new

energy efficient models?

Uh...

Yes. Aren't they great?

You're gorgeous. You're perfect.

You know, just not sold on this chair.

I found your brother.

Is Rose with him?

I don't know. I'm on my way.

Be as hard on him as you

need to be. But I want him both alive.

I... I need you to stay.

Forever.

I feel that easy.

Please stay here with me. I

know that out there is all the death

and the k*lling that you write about.

But in here you can

be who I know you really are.

And we can be whatever

we want to be. We can be poets.

We can be artists. We can be kids. We want to

be... we can be poets. We can be artists. We can be creators.

I don't know a choice.

But neither do I. So I am...

I'm coming with

you. Hold. Stop walking fast.

Who do you want?

Hey, boss. How you doing?

Just get back to LKP. I need

someone there when the raven shows up.

He found Marvin and maybe Rose.

Okay. Okay.

Why don't I just call the

raven and I'll get the details myself.

Did I f*cking stutter?

The raven already did your job.

But listen.

Hey! Back away

from the car. That's my car.

Who's this?

It's Kippy.

Kippy? What the f*ck is going on, man?

I know where the flatthirsty b*tches.

They are both in Emerald Springs.

Thank you.

I gotta get the f*ck out of here.

Oh, f*ck!

Marvin m*therf*cking gave me.

God damn it.

Talk to me, ma'am.

Honey, where's my money?

Well, well, well, Rose.

My funny valentine.

You get my

message? A stupid piece of sh*t.

Spell it out clear enough for you?

Nice detective work. I

didn't know you understood.

Russian, let me ask

you this one question, though.

Do you want your f*cking money?

Come to LKP.

Come if you dare, b*tch.

I just need a moment to think.

As soon as Ashley gets here,

we'll get you squared before I go.

Rose.

No. Wait, where are you going, Marv?

What are you doing?

A vacation. I've got to help Rose.

A long vacation.

You're running away, Marv?

Can I?

Don't leave us. We need to excuse me.

Where are you?

Rose!

Ralph!

Everything okay, Marv?

Should we come back later?

Or...

No.

I want this home for you.

Marv, you better follow me.

What we doing, boss?

Forget about cleaning up, man. Rose never showed. I'm not gonna

do it. Raven, on the other hand, that m*therf*cker is flying his a*s

all the way to

Emerald Springs to pick up Gable.

Now, I need you to

beat him there and k*ll Gable.

And if it ever gets

to the way, k*ll him, too.

That's a f*cking

weirdo. I don't trust him.

What if Rose is will?

She's not gonna be.

And what about Kitten?

She's not.

Gentlemen, listen.

Listen.

It's time we tie up loose ends.

We f*ck off and we rebuild.

Raven and Gable. How

the f*ck are we gonna do that?

Fire power, man.

Lots and lots of f*cking fire power.

That'll be Ashley with the paperwork.

Marv? Really sorry?

It's just your

brother wants to talk to you.

Um, he won't hurt you

as long as you come quietly

and remember what we talked about, Roger.

Roger?

Stop being scary. Hello.

Hi.

Hello.

Who's this?

This is, uh, an old colleague.

More of a rival. Really?

A r-a-arrival.

Wow, that's exciting.

Ashley, why don't you take the

rebus into the kitchen and get started?

No.

It's okay.

Mm-hmm.

Great.

Let's go to the kitchen.

Come on. Let's... This way.

Oh.

Come along.

Hello again, Mr. Gable.

Hey, it's Cindy. Leave a message.

Back, Doug.

Hey, babe. It's me. Um...

King and I were about

to do something very dumb,

and I just wanted to

call you just in case, um...

You know, whatever.

Anyways, um, sorry if I've been...

aloof and emotionally unavailable.

You deserve better.

I will be better, and I...

I belong by your side.

I just need to k*ll some people.

It's work. It's work.

I miss you, and

that's all I wanted to say.

Thanks.

Yeah.

That was lame.

Nah, bro, that sh*t was real.

I'm proud of you, bloke.

Why'd you park so far away?

What?

I tell you what, that

sunken living room is a game changer.

Imagine the party's...

Ooh, ooh!

All right. See you later.

f*ck you.

Like walking around the

residential area with your...

with the f*cking g*ns?

f*ck, I just want to

stretch my legs a little bit.

Where is Rose Carla?

Gone.

That's too bad.

You read all this, right?

God.

Okay.

f*ck.

Okay, let's discuss this later

with Swiss cheese, these m*therf*ckers.

I think the time has come.

To death!

These guys were a

tomorrow. They will k*ll us all.

So, same team?

Marvin Gable, where the f*ck you at?)

Who's that tiny bad guy?

Don't want to hurt

anyone. We're just here to talk.

Huh?

Where the f*ck...

I'm a black belt, m*therf*cker.

Hey!

Jeff?

Marv?

Congratulations on the

regional realtor of the year award.

I'll

show him the house next door.

Looks like he needed help.

I think I got g*ns.

I know.

Sounds like a reload.

You go low, I go high.

No, Jeff, no!

That was my b*llet.

No, that's my b*llet.

No, that's my b*llet.

No, that's my b*llet.

It was mine.

Yeah, I tell you.

Gable!

Get that move, m*therf*cker!

Damn!

Oh, f*cking!

b*tches, Raven.

Beast mode!

Here, take that.

You guys--

I need to find something to try.

What the hell is going on?

Everything's fine.

Come on!

Mark.

No, no, no, no.

Chad, Chad.

How are you holding up?

Not good, Mark.

Get on your f*cking feet, Raven.

Get on the menu.

My own appetite.

f*ck you.

I'm so sorry about this.

I'll get these guys out of here as

soon as I can and get right back to your paper.

Come on.

Don't you f*cking

mention what you think you are?

f*ck you.

You little better--

Oh, m*therf*ckers, I'm on your sh*t, boy.

Ah, oh, this sh*t.

Can you do crazy?

Stop it!

Stay here and don't

come out until I come get you.

Please.

It's Mark.

Mark.

And don't worry.

I've got guys who can

patch all this up like new.

Ha!

What?

What?

Ashley, you okay?

Sorry!

No.

Stop it! Stop it!

Stop!

Stop! Stop!

Marv, please don't k*ll him.

Ash... he's a Batman.

Stop!

For f*ck's sake, what are you?

What are any of us?

You told me

to find something that I love

and to go after it.

And I have.

And it's him.

I should listen to my own advice.

Max, thank you.

Merle?

Where's my g*dd*mn money?

Rose.

Rosie, Rosie, Rosie.

My f*cking Valentine.

You know, for a ghost, you

sure have been stirring up some sh*t.

Only took a few swings

to knock the truth out of him.

You think you can play me?

Steal my money?

She knows everything, boss.

Shut the f*ck up!

You're already a dead man.

Yes, sir.

You, Merleau, and Kippy.

So what was the plan?

Start over?

It doesn't work that way, Rosie.

You steal from me, you die.

Boss, listen. She's

got access to all the accounts.

Welcome home, Marv.

Want a boba?

Look at you, Marv. You're a mess.

See, this is what

happens when you go off on your own.

I knew you'd come. I need you, Marv.

I need all of you.

A good, a bad, be everything.

Night in f*cking

shining armor, aren't you, brother?

There he is.

My monster.

Cut him down. Everyone!

It's about f*cking time.

I'm the answer to all my dreams.

You're my star.

My god, I can't stop.

I'm the one.

That's what you are.

There's no one.

I'm the answer to all my dreams.

There's no one.

You're your home I'm living for.

Your love I'll keep forever more.

You're the first, you're the last.

My everything.

You're my f*cking youth.

I'm my power.

For a million things.

I'm the one who's lonely.

You're my power.

For a million things.

I'm the one who's lonely.

Can't you see it?

You make me feel that way.

You're like a first morning loo.

For a million things.

I think there's been so many ways that.

k*ller of the day.

You're my reality.

You're my luxury.

You're the first.

You're my star.

My moon.

Oh girl.

I'm gonna enjoy this b*tch.

Never forget, dear brother.

You've never beaten me in a fight.

Not once.

And after you lose today,

this will again be your home.

Like my hat?

Cliff seemed like a good guy.

But he was never your brother.

I'm your brother.

Brother?

Your brother would use me like you did.

We're a team.

I hate seeing you like this Marv.

You belong with me now.

With you?

Never again.

All you had to do was k*ll Rose.

Goodbye, elephant.

Rose, it's me.

Merle was right.

I do know everything.

What did you do?

Well, I hand-delivered one

last special Valentine's Day card.

Along with a small gift.

A finger.

More specifically, a fingerprint.

Belonging to our

favorite Kiwi, pal, and accountant.

Granting access to

your personal finances.

Which is proof you've been skimming from

our oh-so-serious

Ruski suppliers for years.

I was able to broker a

pretty little creative deal.

Great plan, right?

My fine nurse fee.

Do you have any idea what you've done?

Marvin. Marvin!

Brother, please,

don't let Rose ruin everything.

Happy Valentine's Day, kid!

Rose! Rose! Please wait!

We did it, Marv. Now go

back to the life you love so much.

Rose, there's

something I have to tell you.

What? What do you need to tell me?

I love you. I always have.

Well, say it again.

Make me believe it.

It's like I said, Valentine's

Day is filled with the unexpected.

You're dangerous.

Whether it's finding new love...

You said you worked.

You worked.

Or the opportunity for second chances.

I told you, m*therf*cker.

Or even just giving us the reason to

express the true love

that has always been there.

As much as love hurts,

it's totally worth it.
