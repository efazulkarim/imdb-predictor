One hundred nights

Why are you so scared?

Well...

my parents don't know I dropped out of law school,

and... I'm living with a man they've never met before,

-and... -Shh.

We're adults...

about to get married and start a life together.

Can't we just do that and not tell my dad?

(quietly) Yeah!

I promise you, your parents are gonna love me.

(laughs)

I'm sorry, baby, but you blew that chance

when you had sex with me.

(laughs)

Treat you good

All the time

But there's something

-Just beyond -( phone ringing)

Is that you?

I think it's you.

It is mine.

Brad Boyd will be in the house.

Hi.

He's a natural-born lover

I'm Sienna.

Brad Boyd.

I know. Your voice is in my ear every night.

MAN: Yeah, don't forget, Brad Boyd is in the building, y'all.

Check him out...

(dance-pop playing)

(grunts)

Boy, read the signs of my body

Can't you feel me getting naughty?

Candles left the image burning

'Cause we're about to start this party

Let's communicate with our love

Touch me like you want my love

(whispers) Wow.

Babe, did you get that flower I...

got for you last night?

It was...

Um, I'm just gonna get some food on the way to work.

(alarm chirps)

(door closes)

WOMAN: Babe, can you help me?

MAN: Watch it. I got it, baby.

WOMAN: Oh, thank you.

Thank you.

Okay, what is that smell?

Is that you, or is that me?

-You, since Colorado. -Shut up.

You know, if we would've got on the flight,

we would've been here three days already.

-I don't want to hear it! -Aah!

People die on planes!

People die on trains, they derail.

How about this, how about we

invite your dad and my parents to a restaurant tonight?

And then we can tell them all

at the same time, in a public place.

How about we stick to the plan,

do dinner at my dad's house tonight

and brunch at your parents' tomorrow?

Okay. All right, that's the plan.

It's a good plan.

We can stick to the plan.

And after I rent a car, we could get a hotel

and burn some time.

Hello? -Hi, Daddy!

Hey, sweetie. What are you doing?

-No, you're not. -I'm on a train to L.A. right now.

I was gonna get to see you...

-Tell him the truth. -Um, I was thinking,

we could... maybe, um,

we could go to a restaurant tonight?

That's not the plan!

-Okay, I'll text you the address. -Okay. See you.

All right, I love you, Daddy.

Bye. -Bye, angel.

Hey, your sister's coming to dinner tonight.

I know. She called me, like, a couple days ago.

-Well... -Dad! Not at work.

Why am I always the last person to find things out in this family?

Manny called in sick, says he has shingles.

So I'm delivering the Bugatti to Mr. Endicott.

But we have a bunch of tow calls from LAPD, so...

I don't know what you want to do.

Tell Jesse or Ramon.

They called in sick, too.

Gout and scurvy.

Let me guess.

This is about the health coverage.

That's it. Give me the keys to the other truck.

-I'll tow the cars myself. -All right.

You know, you don't pedal with your feet anymore, right?

Times have changed.

And you have always been my favorite son.

Shut up.

-(air hissing) -Hey! Whoa!

Oh, yeah, cool. Cool.

You know what, I can bring this girl.

No, this other one,

I'm gonna bring this other... Hey, hey, hey, hey!

Hey, stop, stop. That's my car.

That's my car. You know what?

Just text me the address, all right?

Hey, man.

I'm here. This is mine.

I'm sorry, my man, but it's on the hook.

No, no, no, look. Look, it's not hooked up yet.

Look, you haven't hooked it yet.

Yeah, it's...

(groans)

Wait, wait, wait.

-You're cool, right? You're cool -Yeah, we're fine.

-with this. All right, great, we're good. -Okay.

-(whirring, whooshing) -Ah!

Yes!

Uh-huh.

Oh, it's on the hook.

-Like I said. -No, no, it wasn't.

It wasn't on the hook.

I got here before you had it on the hook.

You're gonna have to come claim your car.

What, you think I would trust this ride with somebody like you?

Excuse me?

What, you don't speak English now?

We're speaking English, bruh.

ese.

ese, cuz.

cuz, vato.

Vato, sabes qu? No hablo ingls. Bye.

Cool. You see this?

You see it right now? I got my hand on the doorknob.

-(speaks Spanish) -Know what? I'm gonna call the police.

-Adios, seor. -Police! Police!

I got my hand on the doorknob. You can't tow me

if I got my hand on the doorknob... you know the law, right?

-Here's where you get it. -Hey, everybody!

-I'm towing the car. -Can anybody see here?

I got my hand on the doorknob,

and he's trying to tow my car away.

El vato dice bye-bye! -She saw it. She saw it.

-Hey! -Bye.

No, no, hey, hey, hey!

This is my automobile!

Hey, hey! Do you see me?

-Bye! -Look! Look!

Stop!

I'm here!

Hey! You see me!

I know you see...

Hey, you see me with my hand on the knob, right?

You'll testify, right? Hey!

Hey, hey, hey, hey!

This is my car!

Hey.

Thanks. I knew I could depend on you.

Mm-mm.

Come on.

Get in the back.

Come on, Angie.

-No. -Angie...

You're on punishment.

Fine. Fine, you want to, uh, be my chauffeur,

no problem. Okay.

Come on, James...

I rarely get out, all right?

And when I do, it's to these radio events.

And the women there are young.

Okay, I said it.

They're young.

-And they love my voice. -As your lawyer,

I suggest you curb this habit before you wake up on the wrong side

of some pissed-off daddy's shotgun.

I'm human, Angie. What you want me to do?

-You should let me set you up. -Uh-uh.

No more veterans.

ANGIE: And what is a "veteran"?

-You know. -No, I don't.

Bitter, older women who have been messed over by so many men,

that they're twisted up like w*r vets,

and wake up in the middle of the night screaming,

trying to choke you in your sleep.

They get their little tweezers out and they're stabbing you in the heart,

talking about, "Nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, you know you did it, you know you did it."

Slow down.

You already hooked me up with... the unmentionable.

-I don't want to say her name, so... -Oh, no.

begged me to hook you up with...

Hey, don't.

-If it wasn't for me... -You know we got a rule.

-setting you up with... -Do not say that name.

-Cheryl... -Oh, why?

-Ah, man. -(chuckles)

I know, I'm working on it. I'm working on it.

(exhales)

If it wasn't for Cheryl, you wouldn't have Marcus,

and he turned out wonderful,

and that's a surprise, seeing he was raised by your crazy butt.

Luckily he had me around to watch his back.

(Angela speaking indistinctly)

You'd still be standing on the side of the road.

All true.

See...

that's why you're the only woman I need in my life.

But if you ain't got

Oh, God.

Thanks, babe. (whispers)

-See you later. -Bye.

The old-fashioned way

SONIA: Okay.

How do I look?

You look fine.

Hey, you know those cuff links you made me,

the ones with the little fishes?

-Mm-hmm. -Do you know where they are?

Hey, I looked in there.

Of course, you did.

I can't wait for you to see the car for Lucia's graduation gift.

It's the best work I've ever done.

(indistinct chatter, elegant piano music plays)

Hey... reservation for Boyd.

Just a moment.

Okay, thanks.

So... we're gonna tell them everything, right?

(sighs)

-Babe. -Yes.

Okay, now, show the twins a little bit.

-Come on, just... -All right, that's gross.

Hi, Izzy.

-Hi. -I'm hungry.

(grunts)

Iz, this is Marcus.

Marcus, this is my sister Isabel.

-Hey. -You look better than your picture.

I like your face.

Thanks, and you...

And your fingernails are nice and manicured.

-That's nice, cute. -Okay, enough.

Can you give us one real quick,

-just a minute? -Oh, yeah.

-LUCIA: What? -Have you told Dad about him yet?

No, that's why we're here.

ISABEL: This is gonna be so good.

-Mom, hi! -SONIA: Oh, my... Look at you.

Mija, you are so grown up.

MIGUEL: No, she's not.

I missed you so much.

-You look great, sweetheart. -SONIA: Beautiful

Excuse me, sir, we're having a family moment here.

Dad, um, Mom,

this is Marcus.

Hey.

Oh... oh.

Oh, this is Marcus. Ah!

You know about a Marcus?

I...

Mrs. Ramirez, it's, it's a pleasure to meet you.

Oh, thank you.

Call me Sonia.

-Oh... -And this is my dad Miguel.

Call me Mr. Ramirez.

Sir, I've... I've heard so much about you.

I can't say the same.

I missed you.

Your table is ready.

-Oh, good. -Good.

-You hungry? -Marcus.

-We should eat something. -Yeah.

It's gonna be okay.

Look, honey, I need to call to see what's taking my dad so long.

-I'll meet you. -Okay.

(chuckles)

Ah, there he is.

What's up, Pops?

(chuckles)

-Oh, I missed you. -(car door opens)

You look good.

-You do, too. -(chuckles)

Thanks.

-VALET: Here's the key, sir. -WOMAN: Hey.

VALET: Where's the ticket?

Oh, uh, Miguel, we left the wine in the car.

Miguel.

Wine in the car. Go.

Oh, I'm sorry.

I'll be right black.

(laughs)

I didn't know her folks were coming.

Yeah, I just figured you would bring Angela.

I thought this was a date thing, not a family thing.

Lucia, this is my father, Bradford Boyd.

-Brad. -Hi.

LUCIA: So nice to meet you.

So, you're the one that my son keeps talking so much about.

(laughs)

Um, this is my sister, Isabel.

Izzy.

Okay.

-And my mother, Sonia. -Hi.

-(giggles) Thank you. -MARCUS: Where's your dad?

LUCIA: He went to the car to get some wine.

Hi.

-Ashley? -Lucy.

Oh, my gosh!

-What the heck? -(laughs)

-Hi. -Hi.

How long has it been?

Like seven years.

Mom, you remember Ashley.

-We played softball together. -Yeah.

-Hi. -Hi.

Um... what are you doing here?

I'm with Brad.

-LUCIA: You are? -Yes, I am.

-Whoa, my  phone is, uh... -(phone vibrating)

...buzzing.

Uh, well, uh, can you give me a...

Excuse me for a second.

Okay, baby.

Well, this is just... I mean, this is beautiful.

-Let's sit. -Okay.

Oh, yes...

I was, uh, saving this for a very special occasion,

but, uh, I guess this will do.

(Sonia clears throat)

Hey, Dad, you remember Ashley, right, from Lucia's softball team?

Oh, yeah.

Catcher, right?

-Yeah, that's good, good. -So...

-Good memory. -Lucia invited you, too.

Actually, Daddy, she's here with Marcus' father...

his date... 'cause they're dating... each other.

-He gets it. -Yeah, okay, you just missed him.

(indistinct chatter)

Uh, waiter, uh, I need this bottle opened now.

-Not a problem, sir. -Thank you.

Oh, and... this is Marcus' father Brad.

You?

You towed my car.

There was a sign. You can't read?

I graduated USC, magna cum laude.

-Oh, you have a degree. -Marcus, do something.

-Keep your voice down. -Brother, brother?

-Hombre, really?

-Dad. Dad. Dad. -Dad.

-What is wrong with you people? -You people? You people?

-This is not the place. -Go ahead and say it.

-You want to say it, don't you? -Pop.

Embarrass yourself in front of your daughter.

-Go ahead and say it. Say-- say the word. -Hey.

-He's a jerk. -Look, Dad...

-Yes? -What's going on?

H-How do you even know each other?

-He parked at a no-parking sign. -He towed my car.

I had my hand on the knob, and he still towed the car.

How many times have we heard...

This is not the place.

-Hey, hey! -Legally you're not supposed...

Okay, let's, let's, let's just calm down and have a seat.

Please.

Please.

Uh, please, you first.

(elegant piano music plays)

No, you first.

Oh, no, no, no, no, no, you first.

-BRAD: No, no, no, no, no. -What?

-I insist. -Oh, God... I insist.

-Please. -Boys.

Sit.

Of course.

(sighs)

(clears throat)

Pop.

Just straightening my tie.

(pounds table)

ASHLEY: You know what I think?

I think it's amazing.

I think that your dad towed his car, and your dad thinks

-her dad said something r*cist. -Here you go, sir, your wine.

And you're here with me.

I just think this is meant to be.

I think it's absolutely incredible,

and it just connects all of us.

It's... I think this is fate.

ISABEL: Wow.

You know, you just said that out loud.

SONIA: Okay,

uh, let's start this night over.

We can sit and have

a lovely dinner and, uh... enjoy getting to know each other.

That's the point of this whole thing, right?

-ASHLEY: Mm-hmm. -Actually, the point of all this

is to let you know that... ow, ow.

We're hungry.

Let's eat.

Mmm, yeah.

LUCIA: I hear the gnocchi's really good here.

What are you doing?

I'm just looking at my menu.

We're getting married.

-(loud bang, dishes clanging) -What?

MIGUEL: What?

What?

Yep.

We are.

Yay.

Oh, so sweet.

Marcus is volunteering for Doctors without Borders

for a year, and he leaves in three weeks,

so we wanted to do it before that, before he leaves to Laos.

Laos, like Laos Angeles, Laos Vegas?

Just Laos.

Daddy, it's near Thailand.

Wait, wait, wait, wait, uh...

what's the rush? I mean,

unless there's something that you two need to tell us.

Oh, my God, you're pregnant.

-Lucia. -Are you pregnant? Is she?

-ISABEL: Lucy! -What? No! No, no, no.

No, Dad, I'm not pregnant.

(sighs)

That would be impossible.

Okay. (scoffing)

"Impossible"?

Mm-hmm.

-Impossi... impossible's good. -Good.

-Impossible's good. It's good. -Impossible's good. That's a...

I'm very proud of you.

We know this may all seem rushed,

but it just felt right, you know?

I-I couldn't leave without her.

LUCIA: And I...

can't just let him leave without me, so...

Wait, w-w-wait, wait, wait, wait.

You're going with him to Sri Lanka?

Laos.

It's near Thailand.

What about... what about your law degree?

Well...

it's not gonna affect it at all.

I checked. I did the research.

Foreign exchange law classes at the University of Laos?

-Shh. -Hmm.

Is there even a University of Laos?

-Yes, I checked. -Baby...

Bye.

What, you couldn't get your tow truck down here

-fast enough to tow it? -MIGUEL: Hey, Brad?

Watch your head.

Bye, you guys.

-Bye. -Bye.

You'll be hearing from my lawyer.

(laughs)

(gears grinding)

(tires squeal)

I just don't like lying.

Look, I promise, when things calm down, I will tell them.

(car door opens)

I'll see you at home.

mija.

You okay?

Yeah.

I'm great.

After the way Dad acted.

You just surprised him, that's all.

Just give him a little time.

Marcus is a really good guy, Mom.

Mm-hmm.

He wants to do really good things in this world.

And what do you want?

I want the same thing.

Then you're lucky.

(children shouting playfully)

LUCIA: Good morning.

-Ah, good morning. -Good morning, angel. Hey.

Is Marcus still coming?

-Yep. -Good.

-Hola.

Ay, mi amorcita.

-I missed you. -Come here. Come here.

(sighs)

Ay, bien.

(gasps)

(chuckles)

Ay, que brbara.

-(Lucia giggles) -Oh, my goodness.

You make me so happy.

Just wait till you meet him.

-Huh? Hey? -Hmm.

I made you your favorite breakfast, eh?

Choricito con huevos.

Got to fatten you up for your babies.

gordita.

flaca.

-(laughs) -Okay, hey, hey!

-Watch it! -That's enough!

(speaking Spanish)

Ay, Isabel.

Again, no makeup.

How do you expect to find a husband, huh?

I'm not looking.

Ah, you want to stay a spinster all your life?

MIGUEL: "Spinster."

-Huh? -Sounds better than being trapped

by some guy who expects me to cook and clean

and have babies while he sits around getting fat.

Not you, Dad.

(chuckling)

MAN: What's the rush?

At the age you at right now, you 'posed to be

lining them up like bowling pins

-and knocking them over. -Look here.

Congratulations, all right?

Thank you.

Do not listen to these fools. Marriage...

it's a beautiful thing.

I mean, once you find that combination

between trust and commitment...

-Oh, yeah. -...it's like the doors...

-Beautiful. -...just fly open...

Trusting thing.

Loving thing.

You know how much his woman trusts him?

Lauren call him

every ten minutes.

That's how much she trusts him.

(cell  phone ringing)

Well, looky, looky!

BRAD: Greg, Greg, just go ahead and answer it.

-Okay, we're cool. No, no, we're cool. -(Greg mutters)

-Answer it. -Don't move it away, man.

-Come on. The phone got GPS. -It's cool.

We don't have a problem with it. No, pick it up. Go ahead.

Don't try to act tough for us.

I'm not, I'm not trying to act tough.

-Okay, okay. -Greg, go ahead.

-It's... really, really. -Don't tell me that.

I don't want to answer the phone.

I don't need to answer the phone.

(ringing stops)

You see? There...

Phone stopped ringing.

Did I answer it? No. Why?

Because that's how I...

that's how I r... get down.

"Get down"?

GREG: Okay?

Now, as I was saying...

when two people come...

(phone ringing)

Uh... (sighs)

Greg, Greg, answer the phone, man, because she's just

gonna put you on lockdown.

-It's gonna mess up our nights. -(phone vibrating)

No, we don't have lockdown in my household.

They have marital Guantanamo.

Look, so she checks up on me every once in a while?

Ankle bracelet.

So what? You know what I get in return?

Sex on the regular.

Oh, it is so nice. Sex...

When was the last time you had sex on the regular?

"Sex on the regular"?

On the regular.

It ain't all about quantity.

It's all about quality.

Well, just because you pay for it doesn't make it quality.

(laughter)

I'm k*lling them today.

Y'all can laugh all y'all want, man.

Ain't no shame in my game, baby.

Brad, you know how I get down.

-I do. -And my girl Peaches.

And Peaches is...

She is a professional.

-Peaches. -(phone continues ringing)

If you don't pick that phone up,

you gonna be asking me for Peaches' phone number.

Okay, so what happens if you don't answer it?

What-what hap... what happens?

What... if you don't pick it up.

-Oh, well, nothing. -Five...

Um, nothing happens.

Four...

I'm... I'm a man. That's what happens.

Three...

This way, she steps off.

-Two... -She knows.

She knows who... who wears the pants...

-One... -...in this relationship.

Oh, you must have forgot what happened in Cancun

-last year. -Oh.

Hey, honey pie.

-"Hey, honey pie." -What's happening?

No, we weren't talking about you, no.

What's that song that, uh, Babyface made a few years ago?

I'm not talking in my high voice.

I'll buy your clothes

Honey, no, I'm just happy to... to hear from you.

I'll pay your rent

expect you to call... hanging out with...

I'll cook your dinner too -With the fellas. It's not...

-Hey. -About 45 more minutes left.

Soon as I get home from work

Guys, give him a break.

Soon as I get home -...what a healthy marriage we have.

Soon as I get home from work

They're clowning me. No.

Soon as I get home

Soon as I get home from work!

You see that, right? That could be you.

Nah, nah. Lucia's not like that.

Not yet.

You don't really know what she's like.

Where's all this coming from? I thought you liked her.

You saw her dad.

Saw her family.

You're just trippin' because she's not black?

All I'm saying is that you don't know the deal

until you say "I do."

And that ring on your finger, that's about the realness.

I want to make sure that you're doing it

at the right time and that you're not rushing things.

Love can't tell time.

I got to go.

-Where you going? -Pop, I already told you.

I'm meeting her family for brunch.

I miss her. I can't wait to see her.

-All right. -(chuckles)

There go another one.

I'll buy your clothes

I love you.

I'll pay your rent

You scared him away.

I'll clean your toenail shavings

Soon as I get home from work

You're scaring the white people.

(doorbell rings)

-Hey. -Hi.

-Ready? -Yeah.

-You ready? -Mm-hmm.

All right.

(sighs softly)

Buenos das.

-Buenos das.

-Abuela. -Yes?

This is Marcus.

(screams)

Ma'am.

-Are you okay? -Are you okay?

No me toque!

No me toque!

-I was trying to help. -Get up.

Abuela, come on.

-(sobbing) -Just trying to help.

I'm sorry.

Marcus.

-Mr. Ramirez. -Grandma, what do you need?

Hey, uh, I'm, uh, headed off to the store to get some eggs.

Um, why don't you join me?

-SONIA: Miguel? -Uh, sure.

We have plenty of eggs.

No, one can never have too many eggs.

(soul song playing)

Mr. Ramirez, I know we just...

Miguel, Miguel. It's Miguel.

Call me Miguel.

Miguel, weren't you...

Oh, no, no.

Mr. Ramirez.

Mr. Ramirez, weren't you and Mrs. Ramirez young

when you got married?

Yeah, we were. But I was respectful.

I talked to her father first,

so he could get to know the measure of the man I am.

Oh. I'm sorry.

I... I didn't even think about that.

Do people still do that?

If they value family.

I do.

I do, absolutely, sir.

Absolutely.

That's good to hear.

I'm sure you and your wife would have enjoyed time

to get to know me a little better.

I wish there was a way to accelerate the process

of getting to know someone, you know?

Yeah.

Uh, th-there's a grocery store.

(phones ringing, indistinct radio chatter)

It's like you were saying.

A really quick and easy way to find out who you are.

It's pretty simple.

All you got to do is put your thumb on that scanner pad, and that's it.

-Right, Turman? -That's right.

It'll run your prints for the basics,

prison record, warrants, sexual offenses.

(chuckles)

Come on, really?

Really?

Ramirez Towing is one of LAPD's biggest vendors, so...

Sorry.

You know, if I loved someone as much as you say you loved her and I had

nothing to hide, I would do it.

I've got nothing to hide.

So, for me personally, it's easy.

(scanner beeps)

(computer trilling)

See that?

You know what? You're right.

Whatever it takes to win you over.

Oh! Slow your roll before you lose your soul.

Let me walk you through it.

(scanner beeps)

Step back.

(computer trilling)

You're done.

Laos? You know, there's a lot of sick kids in America.

Why don't you help them?

Look, I know health care sucks for our poor.

But there are places in the world where kids have no access to medical care.

-(computer beeps) -Whoa. Hello.

Guys, we got a problem.

There's a warrant for your arrest

for failure to appear on a public nudity charge.

-Bill. -Yeah?

We got us a perv.

That's disgusting.

Miguel. I'm talking about you.

-What? -You got an outstanding warrant

from 1984.

What?

No, no.

I was 19.

We were having fun.

And we were drunk...

I mean, no, no, no, we were not drunk 'cause that would be illegal.

We were high, man... No, we were not high!

-I'd stop talking if I was you. -No, we were not...

Okay. I'm not talking.

Wow.

I'm good, right?

For now.

Hey, man, have a great time in Laos.

-Ah, thanks. -Yeah.

Miguel, please, do not ruin this for her.

He is in love, and he wants to get married.

What's wrong with that?

Don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about.

Look at us.

Look at us.

Just because our marriages didn't work, that doesn't make

marriage a bad thing.

Oh. So are you saying that you'd actually like to do it again?

I don't know.

Come on, why you trying... (chuckles) Come on.

You are crazy. You know that?

I'm not crazy. I just like things to make sense.

Is that okay?

Well, life doesn't always make sense, Bradford.

And love doesn't always make sense.

I don't think that's such a bad thing.

Wow, Angie.

That is so... deep.

I'm so happy that you, um,

you followed me to Los Angeles for that little tidbit of advice.

"Followed" you? Don't flatter yourself.

'Cause I needed somebody to be here and school me.

Mm.

Do a little step for me.

Mm-hmm.

One, gonna have lots of fun.

Are you trying to touch my booty?

I did?

Was that your butt? (chuckles)

(doorbell rings)

All right, I'll be back.

-Oh. -Stop.

I took care of your suspension. I brought it on the flatbed.

I even fixed the, uh, little knob there on the gearshift.

It was kind of tricky on the '65...

BOTH: ...but on the '66, they fixed them.

Wow. (chuckles)

Thank you.

You're welcome.

-Is that, is that a scratch? -What?

There's a scratch right here on my hood.

There's no scratch. There...

There was no scratch on my hood before you towed it.

You're saying I scratched your car?

-You scratched my car! -I did not scratch...

How would I scratch the top of your car?

-Hey! Pop! -I was underneath your car!

-What is wrong with you? -Wait, wait! Pop, Pop, Pop!

There's nothing there.

Look, it's a smudge.

Look, see?

-See? There's no scratch. -There's no scratch.

There's no scratch, sweetheart.

-Okay, Dad. -There's no scratch.

Look, why don't we just all go inside and relax?

-I need to use your bathroom. -Oh, sorry.

But, uh, the guest bathroom...

I'm renovating it.

You might have... to hold it till you...

till you get home.

And that's the only bathroom you have in your whole house?

That guests get to use, yes.

Mr. Ramirez, I'll show you the bathroom.

It's upstairs to the left.

ANGELA: Uh, I guess

a few years after him, I moved here

to practice entertainment law.

Angela's like my aunt.

Well, more than my aunt.

She helped raise me.

(Angela chuckles)

Okay.

(jazz playing)

(door whirring)

(water running, door whirring)

(confused grunt)

Really?

(laughs)

Oh! (whooshing)

Aw...

(door whirring)

So your mother is... is where?

Um, we were divorced when he was five.

I... I fought for custody, and I got it.

She didn't fight back.

(slurping)

(panting)

Yes.

(grunts)

Ah, come on.

Come on!

Stop!

(water stops)

Oh.

LUCIA: All righty, so,

we were thinking,

March third for the wedding.

It's in two weeks.

Nothing big, easy.

Yeah, we wanted to do something small.

Just the people in this room and her sister.

LUCIA: Yeah, Izzy would be there, of course.

-No. -"No"?

-No, no, no, no. -No?

-BRAD: Give it... -No.

What do you mean, no?

No, I mean...

-No. -What is that?

SONIA: It should be something special.

Like, it should be a traditional Mexican wedding.

(speaking Spanish) Too bad we're just one Mexican short.

-Oh, here we go. -No disrespect, Mrs. Ramirez,

but I think that both the cultures have to be represented.

I mean, we have a lot of, uh, African-American

wedding traditions that are, that are great.

And we should explore them.

Like what?

Can't believe you forgot, Angie. (chuckles)

You know, jumping the... the broom.

-One. -We could do that.

-Yeah. Yeah. -That's fun.

Dancing.

We like to do the Electric Slide when we...

-No. -...actually have our weddings.

Oh. I like... that's a nice one.

You must have your dance routines,

your... your merengues, your salsas, your...

Macarenas.

And singing.

We like to do, um...

the, um... the n*gro song.

National black song.

The n*gro National Anthem.

You know the song.

Uh...

Lift every voice and sing

-Marcus? -No.

Till Earth and heaven ring

Cantamos bien. Cntale.

Mxico lindo y querido

Okay. Okay.

-Ring with the

-Stop. -Pop.

Que digan

Que estoy dormido

-(Brad and Miguel singing over each other) -Dad!

-Dad. -Brad.

-Dad, hey! -Can you stop?

Tell him to stop, too.

-MARCUS: Pop? -No!

Brad, come on.

-LUCIA: Dad! Hey! -MARCUS: Pop.

Can you stop?

Me... xi... co

-Song... full... of... -Stop! Stop!

Stop.

Y querido -Dad!

Querido -Stop.

Querido -BRAD: Ah-ah.

Cool.

-MIGUEL: Me -LUCIA: Look,

I think that we could incorporate all of these things.

We can think about making the wedding a little bigger.

No, no, we... we can't afford that.

l paga.

l paga.

En Mxico, la tradicin es...

que el pap del novio... -MIGUEL: She's saying that, uh...

...paga toda la boda.

...or the godparents, basically... pay for the wedding.

-Mm-hmm. -But since there are none in this case,

that, uh, it's up to the father of the groom,

to pay for the wedding.

Es tradicin.

Tradicin.

-That's tradition. -Mmm.

(laughing)

Got to be joking...

I'm sorry, but... I just...

Look, if it's too hard to handle... I mean,

if you don't have the money, I mean, I understand.

It's just... try to be a man about it.

Excuse me?

No, not "Excuse me." Say, "I'm cheap."

"Can't do it."

Fine. It's handled.

I'll pay for it. Don't worry.

It'll be big and Mexican.

-(groans) -We'll have my cousins come over.

They're going to speak Spanish. you know the ones

that act so Mexican they embarrass us?

Great. We have two families.

The simplest thing is to split the cost.

Okay, hello. Hey.

Um, what about us?

It's our wedding.

What about what we want?

Four words:

"Our marriage, their wedding."

But I'm just saying that...

Repeat after me, "Our marriage."

(clears throat)

Our... our...

BOTH: "Our marriage."

"Their wedding."

-BOTH: "Their wedding." -Great.

So, I suggest we go with a DJ, instead of a band.

Oh, we could save money on that.

I got a crate full of Tower of Power records.

Dad.

I'll handle the DJ.

That's a good idea.

Okay, that still leaves the venue.

Why don't we just have it here?

-BRAD: What? -Yes!

-MARCUS: Yes. -No, no, no.

-No, no, no. -No, that's a great idea.

This place is perfect for a small wedding

-and reception. -SONIA: Yeah, and we can set

the tables on the lawn, and we can float candles in the pool.

-And release doves? -Oh.

"Doves"?

Do... Do you know that there's acid in dove droppings?

Do you know what that does to wooden lawn furniture?

It puts little bitty spots

-all over the fur... -Dad, I know how you get

about the crib, but it'd mean a lot to us to have the wedding here.

No doves.

(squeals excitedly)

No doves, all right?

(cooing)

Mom, I like these.

Mmm.

-Iz, which ones do you like more? -( phone ringing)

Hello.

(pounding)

What? Watch it, man.

You're going to break the door.

Oh, I'm sorry, man.

I think I got the address wrong.

Do you know which house is, uh, Brad Boyd?

I'm Brad Boyd. This is my house.

Are you sure?

Yeah, last time I checked.

I supposed to build an altar for Lucia's wedding.

You sure is your house?

What? What, it can't be my house?

What... what are you trying to say?

-Go ahead and say it. -Nothing, bro.

Oh, I get it. (laughing)

Se cree dueo de la casa el negrito, eh?

I was in a really serene place.

I'm doing my morning meditations.

I'm sitting out here, and you got people running

My Uncle Manny

works construction during the week,

it's going to be on his off hours.

Whoa, whoa, slow down, slow down.

That vase... that's a Bauer... it's very expensive.

God, I can't believe it.

This is ridic... Whoa!

(yelling, whimpering)

-(crunching) -Aah!

Sonia, thanks for this wonderful seating... board.

Schematic. A seating schematic.

ANGELA: All right.

Well, trust me when I say

the seating schematic is the most important

and complicated aspect of this process.

How we arrange these tables can be a difference

between a day to cherish and a hellish oblivion.

-Oh, good. -BRAD: Okay. I'll start.

Put my mom, my brother,

his wife, my two nephews, my dad

and stepmom...

from Saint Louis at table 3.

Mmm.

Oh, hey, Earlene.

You still screwing my husband?

I'm not your husband, woman!

Oh, yes, you are. We never got a divorce.

We're just legally separated.

You never got a divorce?

Baby, it's been 35 years.

I figure a statue of limitation or something.

You never got a divorce?

-Alzheimer's. -You lied to me!

(group gasping, glass shatters)

Still the other woman.

How does it feel?

-I'll show you how it feels! -(shouting)

to be tricky.

and your nephews at table 9?

he's a big mama's boy.

-Can't be far away from my mom. -Mama.

Mama!

-He's never gonna... -Why you calling your mama?

Mama.

Um, Sonia, why don't you put

your Aunt Rosita and Uncle Juan at table 6?

and the kids there, as well.

(snoring)

Oh, you must be with the black groom's family.

I know this because you are black.

(laughing)

(woman screaming)

Ay, mamita.

Oh! What was that?

Oh, no, no, no, no.

near any women.

Oh, well, in that case,

can we move my friends

Mmm.

when they drink.

So do my girls.

(raucous hollering and whooping)

Okay. What about Raymond?

I thought he was in prison.

Paroled last month.

What the f*ck you looking at, Holmes? Huh?

(glass shattering)

Mom!

Table 8, table 8.

Yeah, the officers from Rampart.

Yeah, that's good. That's good.

(g*n hammers cocking)

(screaming)

What about Marcus's mom?

Your ex.

(chuckles)

(chuckles softly)

What?

Okay.

SONIA: Oh, my.

WOMAN: This way, ladies.

Okay, thank you.

Ladies, welcome.

Oh, my God, Lucia, look at this.

Oh!

Look at this one.

Okay. Let's begin our journey with a picture.

-Oh. Okay. -That's okay.

ISABEL: Hey, Luce, I've been meaning

-to ask you... -Smile for the "before."

Is it true what they say about black guys?

-(camera shutter clicks) -Why ask a question

pinche puta?

Ay, tu madre.

tu madre dice que cllense la boca.

Spanish is such a romantic language.

-Isn't it? Yeah. -It is.

Okay. It's time to pick out some gowns.

Mija, look.

Magnificent.

Maybe.

Bravo. Stay still.

Beautiful.

You see?

bello.

-Look good? -Very nice.

Whoa.

Excuse me.

(scoffs)

Why is his white?

He has to be distinctive with the bride.

(grunts)

Oh, I see.

Sorry, but I am the father of the groom.

I'm distinct,

and I would like to have a white dinner jacket, as well.

(speaking Italian)

You cannot.

You have to stay in the black.

That's how it's going to be uniform, just like that.

Our marriage, their wedding.

Look, Pops, just wear the black tux.

It's classic.

What's the matter, Brad?

You don't like black?

Black is always classic.

You know what they say... once you go black...

MIGUEL (clears throat): Your credit goes bad.

(clears throat)

What'd you say?

Come out and enjoy the inauguration

of the most important dress you'll ever wear.

Oh.

-Careful. -(chuckles)

Take a look.

Oh.

(sighs)

(gags)

(sighs)

(woman coughing)

Mom.

What?

What are you doing?

It's so pretty.

-Mom. -Oh.

I just... I thought I'd try some things on with you,

you know, to save time.

Right?

Our marriage,

-their wedding. -That's cute.

Izzy, where's your dress?

I wasn't really feeling it.

You weren't feeling it?

Well, did you even try it on?

-Sure. -Well, what's wrong with this dress?

-I like it. -Then you wear it.

And since when do you like pink?

It's not pink. It's lavender-rose.

Yeah, whatever.

What the hell is your problem, Izzy?

You're supposed to be my maid of honor.

I never asked to be your maid of honor.

You're my sister.

Okay, that's what sisters do.

I vow to not get married young like Yesenia or Letti.

BOTH: Always pregnant or getting pregnant, never dreaming of anything better.

I know the pact.

Okay?

I fell in love.

It changes things.

But it doesn't change who you are.

You don't think Mom told herself that?

You think she's happy?

Yes.

Okay, what the hell does she do all day?

Her jewelry.

Yeah, okay, sure, if she's not taking care of Dad.

And when do you think's the last time he did something nice for her?

I'll bet you that dinner the other night was, like, their first night out

in, like, a decade.

And you saw the way she was looking at the vibrator in the lingerie store.

She probably thought it was a food mixer or something.

No, it was like she saw water in a desert.

-Okay. -(both laughing)

Stop. That's disgusting.

(both laughing)

ISABEL: I swear, you get pregnant before you're 30,

I'm going to kick your a*s.

LUCIA: Look, Izzy, I'm not Mom.

ISABEL: All right, well, I'll check back with you in 25 years.

(kissing)

("Soon as I Get Home" playing)

I'll cook your dinner, too

Ooh, baby

Soon as I get home from work

I'll pay your rent

What? (laughing)

What, why are you laughing?

My dad's friends were singing this song to me

'cause they say I'm whipped.

Really?

They just don't know what I got.

Girl, I'll treat you right

And I'll never lie or flirt

Ever mess around

Soon as I get home

Soon as I get home from work

I'm comin' straight home to you, baby

All right, keep your eyes closed

just for two more seconds.

Come on, Miguel, I've got, like, a thousand other things to do.

Yeah, I know, but I just wanted you to see Lucia's present.

Look.

(gasps)

Oh, my God.

Is this your old ride?

Yeah, sexy, isn't it?

(chuckles)

I just finished it this morning.

You like the new color?

Pink? (chuckles)

Yeah, come on, get in.

Ooh.

Aw, we had some good times in this car.

Yeah, we did.

Hmm, want to have some more good times in this car?

Yeah, yeah... oh, no, not now.

-Yeah, come on. -No, no, no.

-Nobody's looking. Nobody's here... -It's the garage.

-No, no, no, no, no. -Nobody's here.

-(unzips pants, honks horn) -'Cause... oh, hey, ho, we're...

-(both grunting) -Down here?

-That's fine. -That's not what I meant.

I meant get off, not get on.

-ISABEL: Really? -I was trying to get away from... you.

You guys are old.

-That's disgusting. -No. No. It's not what it looks like.

I'm looking at the rusty muffler from under here.

Yeah, I bet it's rusty.

MIGUEL: No, really, Iz.

Hey, hey, hey, hey, you don't touch another man's grill.

Give me that.

So, Marcus, are you Catholic?

Hmm, technically I'm Baptist,

but I'm not really into organized religion.

But he believes in God.

Right, baby?

Yeah, I just don't go to church.

(speaking in Spanish) He's a heathen.

Mami, por favor.

She's just saying that traditional Mexican weddings are

traditionally...

Catholic.

Well, we were thinking about something a little less traditional.

-Right, Lucy? -Hmm.

We were just thinking about it, just...

Like what?

Does your woman know how to cook?

No, but it's no big deal. My pops taught me.

Your, your pops taught you?

So, Lucia, your dad was telling me that you're at Columbia Law.

-Mm-hmm. -Dean's list.

ANGELA: Great school.

You plan on taking the bar in New York or California?

Oh, I don't know yet. I haven't really decided.

Hey, you know what? I think everybody's being

a little bit off mark right now,

talking about law degrees and all that.

This woman can't even cook.

What you gonna feed your children, huh?

-T.J. -Froot Loops, huh?

Spaghettis, huh, out the can?

-Quin es what?

-Come on. -What, what that mean?

You talking about my mama?

CECILIA: Can your mama make huevos rancheros?

-T.J.: Huevo what? -BRAD: Come on.

Have you called Father Paez yet?

Nope, not yet.

Lucia, it's going to take a personal plea from you

to get him on such short notice.

And if you can't, what are you going to do?

I'm sure we can get somebody else.

(speaking Spanish) So can Lucia.

Grandma, stop. We were thinking we might just write our own vows.

Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

Father Paez baptized you, and he's done all of our family weddings.

Isn't it enough that you're being disrespectful

to your faith by not marrying in the church?

Okay, I will call him. I'll call him.

(sighs)

We were supposed to come to town,

and you were going to come clean to your parents,

and have a small ceremony before heading overseas.

Now all I hear is "tradition this" and "tradition that"

and you changing everything we agreed on.

Well, I can see how you might be a little reluctant towards tradition,

given the very unorthodox way you grew up.

"Unorthodox"?

Marcus, you were raised by a single man

who dates girls I went to high school with.

It's a little unorthodox.

No, you're trying to flip this on me,

make up for the fact that you can't tell your dad

-the truth. -All right, okay.

You know, you get around your family and you act like a little 12-year-old.

-You're a grown woman. -Marcus, I don't really feel

like talking about this right now.

Baby.

Babe.

Lucia, I'm sorry.

Look, everything is just so tense around this wedding.

-You know? -Yes, I know.

I don't really want to think about this wedding anymore.

We just need to have fun.

Have fun?

That's not what I meant.

All right, sweetie, give me a good one this one.

Hey, hey.

LUCIA: Baby!

Hi.

Daddy, I invited Marcus.

He played in high school. He's really good.

What's up, Pop-in-Law?

Hey, Miguel,

Lucia said that your team needed some help, so I'm here.

-Hi, Brad. -Hey.

What? Yeah, no.

Well... we don't need any help.

We've never won a game.

I'm gonna warm up with Marcus, Dad.

(cheering and applause)

Marcus, make sure you're ready.

(spectators cheering)

LUCIA: Come on, Dad. You got this.

All right, Luce, you know where to put it.

(grunts)

-What the... -It's all right, Dad.

-Marcus. Go ahead, Marcus. -Show the old man what you got.

Come on, Marcus.

(cheering)

Yes!

(ball whooshing)

(cheering)

Go, baby!

MIGUEL: See, we're not all about the flash.

We're about the work ethic.

That's why we dominate the game.

Oh, like A-Rod and Manny?

That kind of work ethic?

Well, those guys are Dominican.

I'm sorry. What are you trying to say?

Come on, B-Squared, you got it.

-Come on. -Give me one.

(cheering)

WOMAN: Come on, Brad.

(whistling and cheering)

I got it. I got it.

Good job, Dad.

All right, everybody. Come on in. Come on in,

Come on in. Guys, come on in. Come on in.

-Okay. -Okay, look...

we're only down by one.

I just need one of you to get on base,

and I'll get us home.

-Right? -That's a good plan, good plan.

I've never seen anybody strike out in self-pitch softball

-before. -Oh, well,

the bat slipped, okay?

Hold it tighter next time. Just a thought.

Dad, you got this.

-Okay, I got this. -All right, "win" on three,

-I got this. -One, two, three!

-ALL: Win! -Watch, brother.

You're about to witness Mexican power,

-my friend. -Dad.

Oh, I don't think so.

Yeah, Mexican power. Say it.

-Hold the bat. -No, "Mexican power."

-Just hold the bat. Hold the bat. -"Mexican power."

-"Mexican power." -Don't drop the bat.

-iPoder mexicano!

Don't drop the bat!

-El poder mexicano! -Don't drop the bat!

Come on, Miguel.

All right, Daddy.

MAN: Ah, he's a joke.

-Don't pay attention to them. -Bring 'em in, guys.

-Come on in. -Here we go, nice and easy.

BRAD: You can do it. Hit the ball.

Hit the ball! Good job.

(cheering)

MAN: Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

(Miguel yelling)

(crowd groans)

Daddy, go, go!

-Go! -Come on, Dad!

(grunting)

MAN: Come on, man. Come on!

MAN 2 (laughing): He's short!

That was a good hustle, Dad.

BRAD: You got to be kidding me.

Miguel.

(stammering)

W-W-W-W-W-W-What was that?

ISABEL: It's all right, Dad.

(cheering)

Come on, Marcus. Knock it out of the park!

-One more time, baby. -Knock it out of the park!

Come on, Daddy. Give him a good one!

BRAD: Knock it out the park, Marcus!

SONIA: Come on, baby.

Bring Mama home!

CROWD (chanting): Marcus, Marcus!

-Marcus, Marcus! -You got this!

WOMAN: All right, Marcus, show the old man

-what you got. -Marcus, Marcus, Marcus!

Marcus, Marcus, Marcus, Marcus!

Marcus, Marcus, Marcus, Marcus, Marcus!

(yells)

-(Marcus grunts) -What the...

-You crazy? You crazy? -Daddy, what are you thinking!

-You okay? -Are you crazy?

-What? You want some? -You lost your mind?

-Come on. Let's go. -Oh, now you're crazy.

(overlapping yelling)

(yelling indistinctly)

(indistinct chatter)

This whole thing, it's ridiculous.

What is your problem, Dad?

What is my problem?

Brad att*cked me.

Yeah, after you beaned Marcus with the ball.

Oh, the ball slipped, and the way he fell to the floor all dramatic, I mean,

-come on. -Dad, stop.

He's not good enough for you.

SONIA: Oh, come on. How can you say that?

He went to USC, he graduated from Columbia Medical School.

Daddy, what is the problem?

If he's so special, why'd you hide him from me?

I wasn't hiding him.

We speak every Sunday, and you never brought up his name.

Why?

mija.

MARCUS: I promised Lucia

her parents would love me.

Here you go.

Guess I lied.

Dude's a little off.

You know that, right? I mean, he's a little touched.

To be honest, I'm not in love with them either.

I mean, is that wrong?

Should I be worried about that,

or the fact that none of this is going like I thought it would?

You say you want to marry her, I'm good.

You say you don't want to marry her, I'm good, too.

That's not what I'm talking about.

I just really need some advice here.

I'm your dad, but I'm not the person to ask for marriage advice from,

'cause you know how I feel about that.

You'll figure it out.

I've always let you do your thing,

and you always do it good.

Yeah, I know, I just...

sometimes I wish you weren't so...

unorthodox.

Oh, oh, okay, oh, I see.

Just 'cause I didn't make you eat that asparagus,

make you grow up really big and strong.

You still grew up big and strong.

(both chuckle)

Is that what you wanted?

Yeah, maybe.

I-I-I can see that you're head over heels for this girl.

I felt like that about your mom.

I rushed it, I ignored all the signs.

So if anything doesn't feel good...

anything...

all I'm asking is that you trust it.

Okay?

Yeah.

Here's the pitch.

High and outside. Ball three.

nearly as sharp today,

as he was in his last outing.

of the strike zone

in a long, long time.

and second in the third.

No score.

You know, when you were a little girl, I would rock you to sleep.

I would dream about the day that you'd get married...

what it would be like, what he would be like.

This is just not how I dreamt it would be.

Yeah.

Well... (sighs)

It's not your dream anymore, Dad.

It's mine.

And when I look at Marcus, I don't see brown or black or white.

Isn't that how you raised me?

(vehicle approaching)

Have a good night.

Okay.

(car door closes)

and the bases are loaded!

And we have got us a ball game.

Here comes the bride

Here comes the bride

-On the top of the cake. -BRAD: Oh, my goodness.

Is this... is this organic chocolate?

Oh, yeah. Oh, no, no.

This is from where?

-No, no, no. -Different places... what?

-Listen, I want... -Three different places?

-No, I... no, no, no, no. -Venezuela?

I want you to experience the cake like you will on the day.

The bride and groom need to feed each other.

-Oh. -That's the tradition.

That's really sweet.

-Yes. Isn't that lovely? -But we're not the ones...

Wow, that is such a great idea.

Honey.

I bet it even tastes different.

You only get married once.

That's exactly right.

-Here we go. -Yes, you link arms.

-That's the tradition. -Link arms.

Bride needs a little cake to feed to the groom.

And then, how do you turn it around to go back like...

-Oh! -Oh, no, I just...

You see what I'm saying? This whole thing is ridiculous.

But you've never been married.

Why do people who love each other shove cake

-in each other's face? -Yes, that's why they have rehearsal.

Because they love each other.

Why do we have to have cake?

-Because they love each... -Whoa!

WOMAN: No, that's not how we do it.

You're supposed to take a little piece.

-Well, that's how we do it. --Oh, it's on. Oh, yeah?

Oh, yeah, it's on.

No! What are you doing? No, no, no!

Oh, what are you doing?

Get out of the way.

-Get out of the way. -Excuse me. Stop!

-Stop! -Oh! Ow.

-Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow... -You just hurt her.

-You okay? -We need to clean up.

-Okay, this is gonna... -Oh!

Oh, my God, it's starting again?

You need to leave. I know you're getting...

No, no, no.

-Oh, God. -Okay...

Okay, not in my hair!

-Are you serious? -(laughing)

(sighs) So much more fun planning a wedding when...

you're not the one getting married.

You got to speak for yourself,

because this wedding's k*lling me...

and my pocketbook.

I hear you. (chuckles)

(slow R&B plays)

What?

You just threw that in the middle of the floor.

You know you just threw that on the floor?

-You're messing with me, right? -I am.

I do half of the things I do to mess with you.

Why do you want to mess with me?

Because...

Why do you like messing with me?

I think...

You think?

Like a fool in love, I stay

And pray you'll save your love for me

I can feel it

Even when you're not here

I can't do a thing

Oh, I'm so in love with you

So, darling

Help me, please

Have mercy on a fool like me

(sighs)

Getting nervous?

Nah.

Darling, just save your love for me

That's Brad Boyd. Coming at you live,

Hot 93.7, KZLY.

So, what's on tap for tonight, L.A.?

What am I doing tonight?

is getting married,

so I'm going to be at Le Spot

looking for a DJ for the wedding.

So, the question is:

What are you doing tonight, L.A.?

All right, caller, you're on.

Hey, Brad, it's Miguel.

for half the wedding,

I'm coming with you to see about this DJ.

(dance music playing)

-BRAD: What's up? -MAN: Hey, Brad, how's it going?

-MIGUEL: I'm with him. -Whoa, whoa.

-Brad! -Take it easy, buddy.

-This guy won't let me in. -He's okay.

-He's with me. -Sorry.

Come on.

-Hey. -WOMAN: Hey.

See this?

Yeah.

I'm going to have a drink, man.

Um... bartender.

I'm not a bartender.

This is a bar,

and you are tending it.

I'm a mixologist.

A what?

Mixologist.

Don't mess with this guy's identity, all right?

What kind of beer you have on tap?

We only serve what's on the menu.

Could I have a Hendrick's

with, uh, about this much tonic and a splash of bitters?

It's not on the menu.

-Let me know, guys. -Watch this. Watch this.

Bartender!

Hey, guy behind bar!

Sir Mix-a-Lot!

Mixmaster Flash!

Mixologist!

Yeah.

(chuckles)

I'll just have a Pink Nipple.

Make that two Nipples, please.

Wow.

Gives it that irrigated flavor.

Really?

He's serious.

-Look at that. -Ooh.

Just like a Cosmo, you know.

-What? -A Cosmo!

-Open up a tab? -We're just going to have one drink.

I think I got that fever

Ah.

Hey, mixologist.

Please fill my liquid receptacle.

When's the last time that you were in a club?

I've been married for 25 years, right?

So... 25 years!

Whoo! Whoo!

(hip-hop plays)

Yeah, baby!

Oh, yeah, rip it up.

Remember that?

And then, oh, what about this?

The Cabbage Patch. Whoo! It's the Cabbage Patch.

It's the Cab... and then the Roger Rabbit, bro.

Remember that movie? "P-p-p-please!"

Wait, wait.

Yeah, there it is. There it is.

-I can do it. -(Brad laughs)

The Matrix! Look, look... The Matrix.

I'm Neo! I'm Neo!

You can't sh**t me!

-Hey, Brad. -Yeah?

MIGUEL: I can't get up, bro.

-Oh, you got it, you got it. -Come on.

-Yeah. -Whoo!

That's a true story.

Do you guys know Duran Duran?

"The Reflex"?

I towed them... all of them.

They gave me this tie, man.

-(woman squeals) -This is a Duran Duran tie!

Yeah, man!

-So delicious... -BRAD: Miguel?

You got to chill on the drinking, man,

'cause we still got to go over here and talk to the DJ.

Oh, yeah, 'cause that's why we're here.

-Yeah. Hey, hey, hey, hey. -DJ...

-DJ... DJ Spin... -Yeah, DJ, man!

-Spin-Sane. -There he is!

The Spinster!

Yeah, I'm Spin-Sane.

But I ain't no DJ, gramps.

I'm a turntablist.

(Miguel and Brad laughing)

You got... exactly, man.

It's a whole new world out there, bro.

See, he... isn't a DJ.

He's a turntablist.

Turntablist. (laughing)

And that guy over there...

-mixologist. -Mixologist.

And I am not a Latin.

-No? -I am a Latinist.

So, add a "ist" at the end.

For shist, my nist.

'Cause what are you?

I'm a... radiologist.

You're a doctor! You're a doctor!

I always wanted to be a doctor.

Like father, like son.

-Doctor! -BRAD: Whoo!

-Whoo! -MAN: What the...

(Miguel laughing)

MAN: Hey, man!

-Yo, cool, cool, cool. -No, that's funny.

-Come on. It's funny. -Chill, man, chill.

-Wow, look at his face. -It was a mistake.

-He's like a mountain. -He's been drinking a little bit.

-Hey, you're a mountainist. -Hey, we gotta ch...

-Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh! -Whoa, whoa, whoa!

He wants to dance!

He wants to dance. (singsongy)

Brad!

Ooh! Ooh!

(phones ringing, murmuring in background)

MAN: Captain, line two.

CAPTAIN: Oh, thanks.

You should have the wedding here.

You can't seem to stay away.

MARCUS: You were supposed to just go in there and see the DJ.

Why couldn't you even do that?

It's not my fault.

I told you he was a little touched.

He went crazy loco on me in there.

Too many Nipples.

-LUCIA: What? -Look, for the next

couple of days, I just need you to be my dad.

After the wedding is done, you can go back to being Brad Boyd.

-Hey. I'm always your dad, all right? -MIGUEL: Yeah.

And I've always been your dad.

-Jesus. -MIGUEL: Hey, watch your mouth.

I get to act crazy and be drunk,

'cause I raised you your whole life.

And then he comes around and tells me that he's going to marry my daughter...

and take her to Timbuktu.

Oh, yeah, and not bring in a paycheck.

He's going to be living off of your lawyer checks while he sits around

just doing whatever he does.

Are you saying that your daughter is too good for my son?

No. No, I'm not.

But I am asking you, Marcus, straight up,

man to man,

would you respect a man

who doesn't pull his own weight?

No, sir, I wouldn't.

(birds chirping)

(sighs)

I'm going to tell him tomorrow.

I promise.

Whatever.

(sighs)

Do you want to be like your new buddy, Brad,

and hang out at the clubs all night long,

picking up on the young girls?

You know, Sonia,

I forgot Valentine's Day,

and I'm really sorry.

The other day,

my daughters made fun of me.

What do you mean?

They didn't know I was listening,

and they made fun of the woman I've become.

They're our children. That's what they do.

No, no, no. I used to be a cool chick.

I was fun.

I was fun. Don't you miss that?

We're not kids anymore.

No, I know.

I know we're not kids anymore, Miguel,

but when did I stop being a woman?

I'm a wife. I'm a mother.

But you don't see me as that girl that you used to pick up in your ride.

And we would just drive,

with the top down...

and then we'd park.

And listen to music all night,

till the sun came up.

But we can't do that anymore, 'cause I got to go to work.

Why is it, when I asked you the other day how I looked,

you said, "Fine,"

but whatever car you're working on looks "sexy"?

I dropped out of law school to be a volunteer teacher.

We think that's noble, he's not going to.

It's going to k*ll him.

Baby, he was drunk and pouring his heart out.

What was I supposed to do?

Stand up for me.

You just stood there and watched as I drowned

to save yourself.

I know about disappointment.

You know how I feel about my mother.

Babe... it wasn't like that.

Look, when you tell me you love me, I need to be able to trust that.

When you say you'll never leave me, I need to be able to believe it.

If you can't stand up to your dad

for our relationship... for me, then-then what are we doing?

Why are we doing this?

What are you saying?

You don't want to do this?

You don't want to get married?

I don't know.

You don't know?

Well, let me make it easy for you.

(sighs softly)

SONIA: Lucia, what's wrong?

-The wedding's off. -SONIA: What?

Wait a minute.

What do you mean, our wedding is off?

No, Mom, not our wedding... my wedding is off!

The wedding's off?

"The wedding's off."

You want to go toss the ball, angel?

No, Dad, I don't want to toss a ball!

And I'm not your angel.

-Lucia, calm down. -Would your angel have

-dropped out of law school? -(Sonia gasps)

You dropped out of law school?

And I've been volunteer teaching

at a charter school for immigrants for three months.

And I love it.

Imagine that, Daddy, I love what I do.

Oh, and I've been living with Marcus.

And yes, we were having sex.

Hey.

Hey.

(chuckles softly)

Uh, I was in the neighborhood, so I thought

I'd drop off the invoice from the caterers.

Okay.

Oh, great.

Great.

Thanks.

Can I come in? (chuckles)

I got some, um, just a couple things I'm gonna take care of.

Brad? Brad, um, I think the omelet's burning.

I'll be right there.

I'll be right there.

Angie?

Angie?

Angela, you're my best friend.

I don't want to mess that up, all right?

There's no woman that means more to me than-than you mean to me.

(sighs)

(car door opens)

(slow ballad plays)

She appeared -(engine starts)

In the distance

Like a prayer

I had uttered

She appeared in my life

Like a dream

Only half remembered

She entered my heart

Stayed a while

She entered my heart

Stayed a while

Made me this smile

Then gone

Gone from my life

Yeah

Her love was like a burning flame

Of desire

Desire

If I could do it all over again...

I would call you after my first semester...

and tell you that, even though I know how hard

you worked to put me through law school,

it just didn't feel right.

I'm sorry, Dad.

How it feels to be loved

I just hope that you can forgive me.

Just gotta learn

MIGUEL: Remember when you were nine...

and you melted that stick of butter on the brand-new VCR

with the Duran-Leonard fight tape still in it?

You were so scared when I came home.

And I told you,

"Even when I'm mad at you...

"I still love you."

I'll always love you.

Oh.

(sniffles)

(music fades)

I made one mistake. One.

What, did he just forget all the times that I was there for him?

Through med school, when his mom would call.

Los hombres son tan estpidos.

He doesn't want to marry me.

He said, "I don't know."

How many times did we scream at each other growing up?

Two hours later, we're best friends again.

Only difference is now we're grown-ups.

Got to apologize first.

Nunca.

We never apologize.

That's how we dominate their brain.

Okay, get up. (laughs)

-Put this on. Come on. Let's go. -What are you doing?

Being your maid of honor.

-Aw. -Shut up.

Stop it. Go. Get up.

She was... she was beautiful.

She was... classy.

(chuckles softly)

Adventurous.

(soft jazz playing)

But she never really loved me.

Five.

Know how I knew?

How?

She never laughed at my jokes.

Pop, your jokes are corny.

That's not the point.

If your lady loves you, she laughs at your jokes.

It was a sign, and I just totally ignored it.

Lucia laughs at my jokes.

That's 'cause Lucia's your friend.

Got to pay attention to the signs.

Five.

(engine stops)

-Wait. Wait. -What?

(whispers) What's the plan?

My plan was to get you here. And you're here.

-Wait. Izzy, wait! -What?

What if he won't come out?

What if he doesn't want to talk to me?

Then he doesn't deserve you.

Come on.

I don't want to.

Come on.

You know...

Angela laughs at your jokes.

Yeah.

Ten.

(domino clacks on table)

(panting softly)

What kind of woman (singing loudly)

Would leave you standing in the cold?

Don't do that. (whispers)

Must have been a silly one

To sacrifice a pot of gold

Abort! (whispers)

-(distant yelping, howling) -Abort.

You're the kind of man

Who needs someone who's always there

(singing in distance)

What is that?

Just need some tender love and care (in distance)

I give good love

I'll buy your clothes

(distant yelping, howling)

I'll cook your dinner, too

Yes, I will

Soon as I get home from work

I'll pay your rent -Stop.

Your...

You're gonna get us mauled out here.

Dogs love me.

Coyotes.

Oh.

Oh, my God. (chuckles)

What are you doing?

Marcus, I'm sorry.

For making you feel anything less than the most important person in my life.

I love you.

And if you still want me, we could just...

we could go to Vegas,

tonight, and get married.

And we could just forget about all of this...

the wedding and the, and the families,

and the traditions and...

Just, just you and me...

Your family would k*ll us.

I don't care anymore.

Babe...

(R&B song playing)

I don't want you to ever feel like you have to sacrifice your family for me.

Never let you go

I wanna talk to you

I love you.

Always?

Always.

I'll never let you go

Told you.

You

Show me who I am and what I'll be

You

Better know this love runs deep

(music fades)

You say that I'm too slow

To go the way you go

SONIA: She's not here, she left with Isabel.

I'm looking for you.

What, Miguel?

Come here.

That's really, really shy

But I'll take

You know what I realize about this car?

What?

It's grown.

It's sexy.

Just like my wife.

(chuckles)

It's like you two were meant for each other.

(gasps)

(laughs)

Oh, God.

Than keeping your love true and strong

(moans softly)

I love you.

I love you more.

I can be cool

Go ahead. Have fun.

(shrieks)

I can be cool

(engine starts)

It'll only take a while

(music fades)

(music grows louder)

Hey, baby.

Want to come have fun with me?

Yeah.

(giggles)

Wow, this is a nice car.

Yeah.

How do I look?

Perfect.

(laughs)

(dishes clattering)

(quiet chatter)

You guys need to take this ball out and play on the grass, okay...

-Okay. -...before you break something.

That goes by the pool on the right...

-By the pool. -Hey, yo!

Yo, don't mess the pot there, all right? (mutters)

Is that my Brian Smith?

Hey, you need to cover that, that's very, very expensive.

Yo, bro, you got a plunger?

Fancy toilet.

Ayudame, por favor. Ayudame, por favor.

I think you have the wrong house.

Me no English. Sorry.

This is the wrong... hey...

Sir, where's this go?

Um, let me, uh, let me help you.

-This goes over here on the table. Thanks. -All right.

Right here.

(excited chatter)

Oh, what is this?

Oh, it's a wedding cake.

Wedding cake!

comprende?

-Ma, Ma, she speaks English. -Hmm?

Oh.

Who are these people?

Excuse you?

You see, this, uh, this is exquisite cake.

No.

I... I chose it myself.

The chef... he worked three hours on the marzipan just to get

-the right molding and design. -Yes, three hours.

A mi me vale madre.

My Lucia is going to have a traditional Mexican wedding cake.

Honey, you all know you're across the border?

-(clamoring) -I'll handle it, Ma.

Yo no me voy a comer esta mierda.

Hermoso. -It's a beautiful cake.

The kids are gonna love this cake.

-Yes! -It is beautiful.

You want cake?

Yes.

You want cake?

-Yes. -Yeah!

(yells)

Oh!

I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

Oh, we can do it, baby!

We can go there!

(screaming)

Oh, no!

Wait. What, what...

-No, baby! No! No! -I will snatch this...

No, we got to give it to Jesus!

Come on. Give it to Jesus!

(whooping)

(indistinct shouting)

Gracias, amigo!

(both speaking Spanish)

What is this? What is this?

Ay, mijo, pues el chivo para la birria.

Oh, my God.

It's a, it's a dish called birria.

-It's for Mexican celebrations. -Oh, no, no, no.

-You need to get this thing out of here. -Yes, I know.

Hey, no, no!

We are not gonna k*ll a goat

-in this man's backyard! -Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

No goat-k*lling in my house!

-(clamoring) -Whoa!

-Hey, hey, hey! -They'll eat anything!

iFelicidades! A la doa tambin, eh?

Not in my house!

-You got to get him! -Go!

(both grunting)

No!

MAN: There's a goat in the bathroom.

(glass shatters, kids shouting)

What now? (whispers)

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey, watch out, watch out! What's going on?

-Who did this? -He did!

(goat bleating, shouting outside)

-I'm so sorry. -Can you take care of your kids, please?

Get the boys, please.

(bleating)

(door whirring)

-Get them outside. -Thank you, Brad.

-You see that little line right there? -Yeah.

-Off limits. -Brad...

-Don't come in my house. -They just hyper, Brad.

I'm sorry.

Nice.

Family.

-I know. -You understand.

I understand.

(goat bleating, clattering)

-BRAD (whispers): Can you see it? -No.

Look at this mess!

He tore your bathroom up.

Can't believe it! Look at this!

Where's the goat?

I don't know. I...

Maybe he got out.

(pills rattle)

What?

(quiet knocking)

(shrieking)

What the heck? Go!

Hey! Hey, Miguel! Miguel! Miguel!

Stop running!

Just let him finish!

Then he'll go to sleep!

(clamoring)

(goat grunting heavily)

-(goat bleats) -Down!

(clamoring)

-MIGUEL: The goat! -The goat!

Look at this.

You know what, they do some kind of ritual around here.

When I saw that goat there was something off.

-Yeah. -I ain't never seen no goat go...

I never seen anything...

All Spanish weddings have goats?

This is ridiculous.

Got to pray.

This is terrible.

-Look at this. -Oh.

Got to pray.

ISABEL: It's all right, Luce. We're gonna fix it right now.

No worries.

GOAT (bleats): Call me.

-Totally got it. We're all helping. -WOMAN: Yeah.

Everybody's helping.

Why is there a goat here?

-Who brought a goat? -Ta did!

Ta, you brought a goat?

TIA: I bring it for the barbeque.

Marcus, you're not supposed to see me! It's bad luck.

(goat bleating)

This is a disaster! (laughs)

(laughter)

WOMAN: All right, everybody, let's get this cleaned up.

We've got a wedding.

Okay, enough.

Okay, gum.

Okay.

(exhales)

I made you these.

Oh, Mom.

-They're gorgeous. -Mm-hmm.

Thank you.

Something new.

-Thank you. -Mm, you're welcome.

Okay, now,

I want you to come...

(sighs)

...and look at this beautiful woman.

(chuckles)

And don't you ever forget it.

Okay.

Are you sure?

We could bounce right now.

(laughs)

You know...

I'm sorry for every wrong word I ever said about your mother.

I'm sorry for every wrong thing that I ever said about marriage.

'Cause the truth is...

if Cheryl were here right now, I would thank her.

Tell her that I don't have any regrets.

'Cause she gave me you.

I'm so proud of you, son.

All right, GQ.

Hi, Angie.

Hey, Brad.

-(grunts) -(sighs)

You ready?

Ready?

MARCUS: Thanks for standing in for my mom, Angela.

Hey.

Hey, you two.

He looks so handsome.

("Wedding March" playing)

MINISTER: Please all rise.

You ready?

-Yeah. -Okay.

Please all be seated.

Um, excuse me.

Sir, I know this is long overdue, but...

-What is he doing? -I don't know.

May I have the honor of your daughter's hand in marriage?

Oh.

Baby, you don't have to kneel.

You can just stand.

Oh.

Thank you for that.

But, uh, you're her choice.

Which makes this my choice, as well.

Welcome to the family, Marcus.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Who gives this woman to this man?

I do.

(clears throat)

MINISTER: Oh, yes.

(clears throat)

And, uh, who gives this man to this woman?

I do.

-(quiet murmuring) -Mm-mm-mm.

Lucia, I am so happy that Marcus found you.

Thank you for being my son's best friend.

Thank you.

You have a beautiful smile. (whispers)

Break.

(crowd chuckles)

(scattered murmurs)

(smooth jazz playing)

Sit...

(clears throat)

(chairs creaking)

Sorry.

(Marcus and Lucia chuckle)

Hold each other's right hand and repeat after me.

I, Lucia, take you, Marcus...

...to have and to hold from this day forth.

For better, for worse.

"For better or for worse."

May we have the arras?

Symbolizing mutual protection in the material world.

Now may we have the veil?

Which brings them together into one.

May we have the lasso?

This lasso symbolizes eternal love.

What God has joined,

no one may divide.

(clears throat)

You may now... kiss the bride.

(cheering, applause)

May I present to you Marcus and Lucia,

husband and wife!

Yo s que te mueres

Cual palido cirio

-The one on the... -On the left.

Angie, can I talk to you for a minute?

-Can I just... -Excuse me.

Can I have a glass of champagne?

-Talk to you later, TJ. -I was...

Ladies and gentlemen,

Marcus and Lucia!

(cheering, applause)

(slow mariachi song playing)

Whoop!

-Hold on. -(laughs)

Hold on.

(techno music playing)

This is the rhapsody, this is

The rhapsody, this is the rhapsody

These are the rappers, get acquainted

This is the rhapsody

This is the rhapsody, this is the rhap

This is the rhapsody

This is the rhapsody

Hey!

(men chanting in Spanish)

They're saying you're whipped!

Oh!

No, no, no, no!

(cheering)

(mariachi band playing)

Hey!

(rhythmic yelping)

En la sierra morena

Cielito lindo

Cielito lindo

Why is she doing? Mija, are you crying?

Porque cantando se allegre

Don't worry.

Cielito lindo, los corazones

And if you don't know, now you know!

(R&B music playing)

If I give you my love

Whoa, whoa

Angie, please.

One dance.

When I give you

DIANE: All right, he's looking.

Don't turn my son down. Go on.

One dance, Brad.

One dance.

Oh, baby

Oh, baby, can't you see?

You're the only one

Make me feel so free

When I give my love

I want your love in return

Come on, Brad. (scoffs)

Angie, don't.

I'm sorry.

Got to get us past this, because... I love you.

Don't you waste my time

No, no

I love you.

Ooh, oh, oh, oh

Whoa

What happens when the music stops?

Let's just make sure that the music never stops, okay?

I love you.

Why now, Brad?

After all these years?

'Cause love can't tell time.

Now, can you handle that?

Can you handle that?

Oh, baby

Oh, baby, can't you see?

-That's nice. -Yeah.

You're the only one

Make me feel so free

When I give my love

I want your love in return...

(music fades)

(slow R&B music playing)

You have a good kid.

Yeah.

And Lucia's lucky to have him.

We're family.

"We're family."

-To the kids. -To the kids.

(mariachi band playing "Soon As I Get Home")

What kind of man

Would leave you standing in the cold?

Must have been a silly one

-Elbows down. -All right.

That's right, Holmes. That's right, Holmes.

Then lean, ese.

Yeah, I give good love

I give good love

TJ: Real dope!

Play some music we can dance to!

("September" by Earth, Wind & Fire playing)

Do you remember

The 21st night of September?

The mind of pretenders

While chasing the clouds away

Our hearts were ringing

In the key that our souls were singing

As we danced in the night, remember

How the stars stole the night away

Oh, yeah

Ah, ah, ah

Ba de ya

I love you.

Say, do you remember?

Ba de ya

Dancing in September

Ba de ya

Never was a cloudy day

Ba doo-da, ba doo

Ba doo-da, ba doo

Ba doo-da, ba doo, ba doo-da

My thoughts are with you

To see you

Only blue talk and love, remember

How we knew love was here to stay

Now, December

Found the love we shared in September

Only blue talk and love, remember

True love we share today

Ba de ya

Say, do you remember?

Ba de ya

Dancing in September

Ba de ya

Golden dreams were shiny days

The bell was ringing, uh-huh

Our souls were singing

Do you remember never a cloudy day?

Yow

There was a ba de ya

Say, do you remember?

Ba de ya

Dancing in September

Ba de ya

Golden dreams were shiny days

Ba de ya de ya de ya

Ba de ya de ya de ya

Ba de ya de ya de ya de ya

Ba de ya de ya de ya

Ba de ya de ya de ya

(acoustic intro playing)

(hip-hop beat begins)

Hmm, soft lips glistening

Got me listening to your every word

Though I don't speak a word of Spanish

Beginning to blur

Though you're not an item to be won

But a dream too lavish to be slept on

So I uncock my w*apon

To your feminine charms

And ask you to dance with me

Though some say I got two left feet

I still glide to the beat

Sliding with diggin' motion

Overdosing from the ocular potion

Emotion crashing like the ocean

Tide rising, splashing

Our silhouettes enclosing into passion

Sweat glistening

Shh, yeah

I'm listening

On this hot Spanish night

Your eyes are like candlelight

I wonder will it be all right with you

If we could glide our way to the moon

De Padron pepper

Sweet like churros, but way better

Let the world go

Let's toast the full-bodied red wine

Sip it slow and let it breathe

As the perfume unwinds

Grapes plucked from a vintage vine

Deep into your intense eyes

And cause and effect

Let me pause for a sec

And I don't want to fall in my step

Entrusting, you got all my respect

Call me collect, my  phone's on roam

And your vocal tone

Hot Spanish night

Your eyes are like candlelight

I wonder will it be all right with you

If we could glide our way to the moon

Hot Spanish night

Your eyes are like candlelight

I wonder will it be all right with you

If we could glide our way to the moon
