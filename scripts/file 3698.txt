After Midnight By Andrew Helm 
Page 1/29
Gentlemen, let's give it up for the Candy Cat Club's featured dancer - Duffy. You're beautiful. 
Thanks, baby. 
Be polite all you want, kid. 
The only thing it's going to 
get you is the poor house. 
Sorry. 
Next up on our stage, please 
welcome the seductive Sasha. 
All right. One for the money 
two for the show. 
You have no clue what I'm 
about. 
All you know about me is what 
you see on the stage, okay? 
And don't you ever think you 
can put your hands on me again. Stripper drama. 
Hey! Slow down, honey. Okay? 
Not now, Rikki, okay? Just 
leave me alone. 
Okay. Well, listen, enough of 
the attitude. 
All right. I am only trying to 
help you, Duffy. 
Well, if you really want to 
help me 
then just leave me alone for 
awhile 
because I'm a little freaked 
out right now 
and I don't want to talk about 
it. 
So what the hell's up with you? Just let her be, Tina. 
Because she's queen bee I'm supposed to just mind my own business. 
What a concept. 
I will mess you up. 
Come on, Tina. 
You don't want the cops coming 
down here again like before. 
Okay. One more incident like 
Page 2/29
that and you're through. 
She thinks she's some kind of 
big shot. 
Always draining every guy's wallet before anybody else gets a shot at them. She even took my best customer. 
There ain't a dollar bill left 
out there. 
Do you want to talk about it? 
Talk about what? 
Well, all that screaming I 
heard a couple of minutes ago. 
No, I don't. 
Okay, well... I'm here if you 
need me. 
I know, Zoe. I get it, okay. 
Whatever. 
It's really coming down out 
there. 
Weather man says it's going to be raining cats and dogs until tomorrow afternoon. Gary's always wrong. He's not 
even a meteorologist. 
That's why I watch Channel 
Eight weather. 
Is the copy in the prompter? 
Done. Only breaking story right 
now. 
Murder in Tinseltown. 
Well, what got dropped? 
The piece about the cat that 
plays the piano. 
I liked that one. 
Turns out he was faking. Ten 
seconds, everybody. Here we go. 
Five, four... 
Good evening, I'm Constance Turner and this is a Channel Six overnight news break. Police are searching for clues 
tonight 
in the shooting death of a young 
dancer outside a downtown strip club. The shooting victim was shot 
execution style in the club's 
Page 3/29
back parking lot just after 
midnight. 
Police released these photos of 
the shooting victim. 
Twenty-six year old, Ann Turner, who worked as a dancer at the Candy Cat... police.. What's going on with her? 
... are hoping that anybody... 
I don't know. 
...any... 
police hope that anybody who has 
seen anything will contact them 
and... and we will be back 
right after the break... 
Spring is just around 
the corner... 
Constance, it's Doctor Hubbard. 
I just saw what happened. 
If you want to talk about it I'm here. Hey, you okay? 
Yeah. I just lost my place. And 
I... I... just that... 
I'll be fine. Let's... just let 
me finish it. 
You sure? 
Yes. We're almost back. 
Okay. 
And it looks like the rain will 
continue through tomorrow afternoon so if you have any weekend travel plans, make sure you give yourself extra time. Okay. Good. Morning crew's going to be here soon. You did a good job. Thanks. 
That story about the dancer? 
Did you know her? 
She was my sister. 
Wow. 
You know, she was the wild 
child of the family, you know. 
She was willful and headstrong. 
She was always just so 
determined to do her own thing 
no matter what it did to my 
Page 4/29
parents. 
Look, I feel like I'm prying 
here now. 
No. It's all right. Look, I am sorry. I should have told someone. 
I understand. I mean this has to be incredibly difficult for you. I... I... I should have reached 
out to her more. 
I should have been a better sister and she did not deserve this. 
Look, tell you what. This has 
been a big shock for you. 
Why don't I give you a ride home and we can talk about it, okay? 
Come on. Come on. Come on. 
Thanks, John. 
You're welcome. Watch your step. So, maybe I should contact the 
police. Tell them who I am. 
No. Police can wait until 
you've rested. 
There's nothing you're going to say now that's going to make a difference. Maybe you're right. 
I am right. Besides the world's 
going to know soon enough. 
And I just... I just wish it 
didn't have to be you. 
You're going to get through it, 
okay? 
And people will stop caring as soon as the next big story comes along. Guaranteed. Well, isn't that the problem, John? That people always just stop caring. That's the way it is, Constance. And sometimes that's the way it should be. I'm going home. I can drive 
myself. 
Hey? You going to be okay? I 
can follow you. 
I'll be fine. And if I'm not, 
maybe that's the way it should be. Look at that. Rain's all cleared up. 
Page 5/29

Told you that Doppler stuff was overrated. A couple of sausage. Here we go. 
And voil. Your breakfast, mademoiselle. I appreciate you coming by but 
you didn't have to. 
Says you. I talked to Rebecca 
and I told her what happened. 
She said you could take some 
time off if you need to. 
I... I don't know how to say 
this, John, 
but I am capable of making my 
own decisions. 
I don't need anybody acting on 
my behalf. 
I know it was well intentioned, but I stand on my own two feet. I always have. Okay. I... thought I was 
helping. So I'm sorry. 
I know. 
Just, now, I am going to be linked to Annie's story and I have to face that fact. You know everything's going to change and if I hide it's just going to make it worse. Maybe. For awhile. I do have 
some sleeping pills 
or something stronger if you 
need it. 
No. No, thank you. I... I 
just... I don't take anything. 
I didn't say you did. 
Why are you trying to help me? 
Because you're my friend and 
I'm worried about you. 
Fair enough. 
So, I got some errands I got to do. So I will see you at work tonight, I guess? Of course. 
Okay. Take care. 
Doctor Hubbard? Yeah, can I 
come by? 
I saw your broadcast last night. 
I became concerned about you. 
You're not the only one. I guess I'm just Page 6/29

kind of walking in my sleep right now. Did you take anything? 
No. No. I wouldn't. You're my sponsor. I would have called you. 
I know. But I'm also your friend. 
And you're right, you should have called me. I'm sorry. 
So what do the police know? 
I got a call this morning from 
some detective 
but they don't sound that interested in the death of a stripper. 
I'm sure that's not the case. 
I didn't tell anyone. You know, 
that I had a... a sister. 
Even John was surprised. 
John, your producer. 
Yeah. My producer and well, 
he'd like it to be something more. Um... how do I put this? 
I... I don't want you to get 
involved with a man right now. 
Look, you've come so far in 
reconciling your family issues 
and I would hate for you to lose 
sight of what's really important. 
Your sister was a big reason 
for all of this. 
But she's dead. 
Death is not the end. 
For Ann to truly get out of your life, you have to be willing to let her go. You're so Zen. That's why I 
like you. 
Look, I'm just a counselor. 
It's okay, Doctor. It really is. 
Okay. Well, then do me a favor just call me more frequently just for my sake, okay? Okay. 
Yeah. 
The Candy Cat welcomes... 
...the southern belle who's a 
blonde bombshell. 
Let's give it up for Britney. 
Page 7/29
Would you like a dance? 
No, thank you. 
Are you looking for a job? 
There's an opening. 
I have to go. I'm sorry. 
Help me. 
Hey, how you doing? You know I tried to return your call a few times 
but it went right to voicemail. 
Anything wrong? 
No. I just wanted to tell you I'm going to take a few days off, like Rebecca offered. Good. Give you time to clear 
your head. Be good for you. 
And also, one more thing, I 
need you to do me a favor. 
Anything. What? 
Do you still have that police 
detective friend? 
Yeah. 
Do you think he could get me a 
copy of Ann's file? 
I just want to find out what 
they know. 
I'll tell you what I'll do. 
I'll see what I can find out 
but you gotta promise me... 
...you'll leave the police 
work to the professionals. 
Got it? 
Sounds like you're telling me 
what to do again. 
My God. What am I doing? 
I'm just going to go in there 
and ask a few questions. 
There's nothing wrong with 
that. I'll be fine. 
The Candy Cat welcomes... 
...the sexy Zoe. 
Hey. 
Hi. You're new here. 
I just came to get a drink. And 
I saw you looking at me. 
You remind me of someone who 
Page 8/29
worked here. 
Someone very pretty. She got 
killed. 
Did you know her well... the 
girl that got killed? 
Well, you never really get to 
know the girls, do you? 
But Duffy, she was great. 
Some of the other girls just want to shake you down for tips and dances but Duffy... she liked to talk. 
She did? I mean what did she 
talk about? 
Hello. Are you here to apply 
for a job? 
You want to come over to the 
bar and talk to me? 
Yes. 
Okay. My name is Rikki. 
Connie. 
Come on. 
Bye, Connie. 
Well, I do have to say that you 
have a... very nice look. 
And... we are kind of 
shorthanded at the moment. 
Yeah, I heard about what 
happened. 
Did you know her well? 
Who, Duffy? Yeah, of course I 
did. 
And I take a very personal 
interest in each one of my girls. I mean I... I have to. 
Why is that? 
Well, because I'm like their 
Mother Hen. 
I've been there, done that and 
these girls are like lost souls. They're like kids that have foster parents that don't care whether they live or die. I guess they're really lucky to 
have you. 
Don't fool yourself. I am no 
Page 9/29
pushover. 
You do junk, you rip off my customers, you steal from me, and there will be hell to pay. Tow the line or else? 
That's about the size of it. 
So, what do you think? 
You want the job? 
Yes. Please. 
You've never danced before in 
your life have you? 
No. I just really... 
I need the money. 
Boy. Amen. Don't we all, 
sister. 
Look, I got a big empty hole in tomorrow night's roster so if you want to show up, you want to shake it a little bit. I don't tell the girls how far they can go with the guys. But one thing directly affects the other, if you know what I mean. 
I know what you're talking 
about. 
Okay, have your start paper filled out and also what I need from you is your stage name. Stage name? 
Yeah. All the girls have stage names. No one uses their real names around here. Um... Ann. 
Ann? Ann? Okay, well that's 
kind of dull. 
Do I fill out my 
paperwork here? 
No, you can take this paperwork 
to the dressing room. 
It's just down the hall and 
introduce yourself to the girls 
and I'm sure you will all get 
along just fine. 
Thank you so much. 
Thank you. 
Thanks. 
Hi, I'm Ann. 
Hi. Hey, do you know anything about these, like, clasp fastener thingies? 
Page 10/29
I can't get this one to pop 
like the other one 
and it's just, like, not as 
hot, you know? 
Try squeezing it first. 
It works! Thanks. 
You just started? 
Tomorrow. 
Have you ever done anything 
like this before? 
No. Does it show? 
Well, you're still standing there 
like you're afraid to sit down. 
Just take a load off. 
Right. Thanks. 
Hey, aren't you scared to work 
here? 
You mean what happened to that other dancer? Did you hear anything about that? 
It's a robbery. Maybe. 
Maybe? 
Yeah, maybe. 
Duffy didn't make very many friends here. Especially not with Tina. 
And she really didn't like Misty. 
She was real jealous. And then this... Britney! Why don't you just shut your mouth about things you don't know anything about. Some of our regulars aren't 
exactly gentlemen. 
I don't know. I've been thinking 
it's a good time to retire. 
Or just move. I hear they always 
need good dancers in Canada. 
It's way too cold up there and 
who you going to dance for? 
Lumberjacks. I mean it's got to be better and safer than this place. 
Well. I'm up. 
Gotta go. 
Good luck, Ann. See you 
tomorrow. 
Thanks. 
You're sitting in my station. 
Page 11/29
You new or something? 
I'm Ann. 
Great. Don't even think about 
looking at any of my regulars. I will seriously mess you up if you do, got me? 
Sure. 
Tina, don't be so mean. She's 
never even danced before. 
I know. And those creeps eat 
girls like her for lunch. 
Okay. I'm up after Zoe. See you guys later. 
Tina, can I ask you a question? Get away from me. 
Who are you? New girl? 
Ann. 
Ann? 
That was Duffy's real name. 
I don't know anything about 
that. 
She made somebody really mad. 
And that person was you? 
No. Not me. I'm Pax. Bartender. I make it my business to know 
all the dancers. 
Bully for you. 
I'm not a bully, baby. I'm a lover. Can't wait to see your act. 
Damn. 
Where you going in such a 
hurry, darling? 
Sorry, I don't start until 
tomorrow. 
Come on. Come on. I got a 
little secret for you. 
You hear anything about... 
about that dancer that was 
killed... Duffy? 
Why? Do you know something 
about it? 
Well, I know a few things. I 
know who killed her. 
Who? 
Page 12/29

Well, maybe you and I should 
talk because... 
how much is it worth to you? 
You don't know anything. 
Hey, I know that you're the 
girl from "T.V." 
No, I'm not. 
Well, sure you are. See, I'm 
good with faces like that. 
Yeah, see, you painted it up 
different but it's you okay. 
All right. Yeah. Hell, maybe I can get a couple of bucks for a, you know, a reporter working undercover 
as a stripper. 
Rusty, damn it. What the heck 
are you doing here? 
You know you're not supposed to be taking photographs. Get out of here. I'm going. All right, I'm going. Yeah. Go. Go. 
You okay? 
Who's there? 
Hey. 
I was going to knock you out, 
kid. Sneaking around like that. You shouldn't have taken that 
reporter lady's picture. 
It's not polite. 
You're not a nice man. 
Why don't you mind your own 
business? 
Get the hell out of here before I kick your ass. 
Yeah, run away. 
Feel better? 
I'm fine. Just a little amped 
up. 
Maybe you can get your doctor to prescribe you something for that. No pills for me. I'm alert and that's how I like it. 
Good. Because you were right. 
My detective friend called me. Page 13/29

Said they don't have any real 
leads on your sister's case, 
so they're going to treat it 
like a robbery gone bad. 
But it wasn't. 
Yeah. I'm sorry. He did say 
though that... 
he'd call me if anything 
changed. 
All right. Thanks. 
Anytime. 
Tired? 
No, not really. Why, what you 
got in mind? 
This. 
I think I thought... 
I thought this was what you 
wanted, right? 
Yeah, it is. But... 
Do you got a problem with that? No. 
She's... she's... 
Hey. Hey, hey. You okay? 
Yeah. 
What's going on? 
I just had a nightmare. I'm 
fine. 
Okay. All right. You sure? 
I am so sorry I gotta run. 
We got development meetings all day into the night. 
Are you going to be okay? 
Yes. I am taking it easy per your instructions and I feel better already. Good. 
You call me if you need 
anything, okay. 
Okay. 
Hey, Sam. I've been thinking 
about you... yes. 
Yes. I will. Soon. I promise. 
Okay. 
I'm afraid I don't have any 
good news for you. 
Page 14/29
There really hasn't been any 
change since you were here last. Nothing at all? 
I wish I had something more 
reassuring to tell you 
but there really isn't anything else to say. 
The trauma is beyond any treatment that I've been able to prescribe. We keep waiting for some kind 
of breakthrough 
and hoping it will happen but I just don't know when. 
No signs, no anything for 
months. How can that be? 
The mind is an amazing thing. 
Sometimes it hangs only by a 
thread. 
We really don't know why she's not responding. 
But I do believe that she knows that you're here. 
I really thought that after the operation... 
We removed glass fragments from the brain. 
But the impact from the 
collision, 
it caused damage in other areas that we're unable to determine. At least your other sister came out of it okay. 
They always say the drunk driver has the best chance of survival. I know your other sister feels terrible about what happened. 
She should. She caused it. 
She's lucky she didn't kill 
anyone. 
Really? Julie's as good as 
dead. Now Annie's dead, too. 
I'm sorry. I didn't know. 
It doesn't matter. Can I see 
her now? 
Page 15/29
Of course. 
Hey. Mind if I come in? 
So, I just spoke with Doctor Miller and he says you're doing great. And it won't be long before you're up and running around again. 
Doesn't that sound fun? 
Julie, I hate to bring you bad news because I don't... 
we don't need anymore in our 
lives right now. 
But there is something very important I need to tell you. Annie's dead. Somebody killed her. 
It happened a few days ago and nobody knows who did it. 
You know it might have been one of those 
psycho customers at the club 
where she dances at or... 
or it might have been a drug 
deal gone wrong or... 
well you know Annie. 
She's always up to something 
funny. 
Anyway, the police aren't 
interested 
so I'm working at the club 
myself to uncover the truth. 
I will find Annie's killer. And when I do... 
I just wish I danced better. 
I hear the tips aren't bad. 
I'll be back as soon as I know something. 
I love you. 
I owe this to you, Annie. 
No matter what happens 
I will find who did this to 
you. 
I promise. 
Why do you always look so 
worried, Sam? 
It's my job to look worried. 
Page 16/29
What's with the new face? Are 
you going out tonight? 
Just wanted to get out of my own skin for a little bit, I guess. It... it reminds me of your 
sister a little bit. 
Really? 
Yeah. By the way, how are you 
doing with that? 
I'm trying really hard to work through this with her. 
What do you mean? 
I have seen her. 
You mean you've been down to 
the police station 
so you can identify the body, 
right? 
That's right. 
Look... I saw Ann every so 
often... you know. 
Why didn't you tell me? 
She was going through a lot of emotional stuff about Julie and... well, you understand, I... 
it's... 
it's really not appropriate for me to talk about it anymore at this time. Julie? 
Why does everybody hide things from me? 
Well, I didn't expect to see 
you back here. 
I always follow through on my 
promises. 
That's surprising. 
That so? 
Especially when it comes to 
women. 
Are we that predictable? 
You're all seeking your daddy's approval. 
You're crazy territorial. 
And you all think you're good 
girls. 
Page 17/29
But deep down you got a dark 
jacked up, 
twisted side that just loves 
guys like me. 
And what type of guy is that 
besides nauseating? 
I'm a wolf, baby. 
In wolf's clothing. 
You got that right. 
Who's the new bitch? 
That's Ann. She came in 
yesterday. 
Well, she's sniffing around my man and I don't like it. 
Whatever, Misty. Who hasn't Pax tried to bang around here? 
I don't care about that, Skank. He's mine now. 
Good. He's a mega-loser. 
I'm going to kill you, you know that? 
Try it. 
Misty, you're up. 
I hope she dies. 
I am so glad to see you here. 
Thanks. 
I'm a little bit nervous. 
You know what, I've got a great idea. Why don't you watch Misty? She is one of our greatest 
dancers. 
But... do yourself a favor, try not to get on her bad side. 
Well, actually, I don't even 
think she has a good one. 
Please welcome to the stage, 
the lovely Misty. 
No. There's no way I can dance like that. Maybe if I... 
Look, you're here, right? Trust me. These guys... 
they are all going to fall in 
love with you. 
I'll go get ready now. 
Page 18/29
All right. You're going to do 
good. 
New girl seems all right. 
Yeah. She asks a lot of 
questions, too. 
What the hell were you doing 
with that new girl? 
Just my job. 
You know what happened to your 
last "new" girl, right? 
What the hell is that supposed 
to mean? 
She's dead. And now this one. 
You ready? 
No. 
You'll be fine. 
This... this just isn't me. 
Yeah, we've all said that before. And you can tell yourself it's all about the money. But the fact is, there's got to 
be a small part of you 
that really enjoys it or else 
you won't be any good at it. 
How is that? 
Well, it's the freedom. The 
attention. 
The feeling of being desired by 
someone when you're on the stage 
with the lights on you just 
doing your thing. 
That makes sense, right? 
More than you know. 
Good. Because you're up next. 
And now the Candy Cat is proud 
to present our newest dancer. 
Let's put our hands together 
for Ann. 
Guys, be gentle. It's her first 
time. 
Bravo. 
And don't you tell me you had 
never done that before. 
Yeah. Nice. Now, you've just got 
eight more hours of it to go. 
Page 19/29
Anyways, I'm off early tonight. Got me a date. I hope he's a nice guy. He won't be. 
He'll take advantage of you 
just like all the others, 
you brain dead floor mat. 
Do you have to be so mean to 
everyone? 
Yes, I do. Mind your own 
business. 
I work here now. Get used to it. Don't challenge me. Don't ever challenge me. 
Where did you get that necklace? It's mine! 
It's not. It's... 
What do you mean it's not mine? You stay the hell away from me, you freak. I mean it. 
I will kill you. 
You know, with the cops looking for a murderer 
you might want to lay off that, "I'll kill you," routine for awhile. Here's an exotic treat from the far east... 
east Los Angeles. Let's give it up for Tina. 
Hey. Not bad. Not bad at all. 
Could use a little polishing 
but that's okay because you've got something... 
you've got something so natural that you can't teach. 
Thank you. 
You're welcome. Are you ready 
to make some money? 
Because I have a gentleman over here who would 
like a private dance with the 
new girl. 
Actually, I don't... 
okay. 
Good. Come with me. I'll 
Page 20/29
explain how it works. 
This is Julian. He is one of 
our best customers. 
I guess, Rikki. Thanks. 
He's harmless. 
So, you want a lap dance. 
Yes. Yes, please. Mostly 
just talk though if that's okay. What do you want to talk about? Um... why you're here. I mean, why you're really here. 
I don't really know what... 
You're Constance Turner from 
Channel Six. 
You do the overnight news. 
I don't. 
It's okay. It's okay. I'm not 
going to say anything. 
And neither is Rusty. The guy 
who took your picture. 
How did you know about that? 
I stole his phone. 
Why? 
I don't want him messing up 
what you're doing. 
Are you working on a story? 
Maybe I can help you, right. 
I hear a lot of things around here. How well did you know Duffy? 
She was my favorite. She gave 
me things. 
What type of things? 
I'd rather not talk about it. 
It's kind of private. 
So what do you want to talk 
about? 
I'm not comfortable talking here. A lot of people overhear things. If you're interested, call me. Maybe we can go out for dinner. I mean... my treat. 
All right. I'll call you. 
You did really good tonight. 
Is it okay if I go now? 
Page 21/29
Yeah, of course. We're closed. 
And by the way you did a really, really good job tonight and I hope you stick around. Goodnight, all. 
'Night, Tina. I'm going to have 
Pax walk you out to your car. 
No, thanks. I'll take my 
chances. 
Okay. 
Hey, Quinn. 
Hi. I didn't expect you tonight. 
Have you seen John anywhere? 
I thought he was with you. He said he had to help you with some things about your sister. Think you'll be back soon? 
They've got me doing the 
overnights but you know 
I'm only happy when I'm out in 
the field. 
Yeah, don't worry. I think I'll 
be back soon. 
Good. Hey, do you mind 
taking a listen to some copy? 
I'm trying to make things sound less stodgy but I don't think I'm very good at it. Yeah, sure. Go for it. 
Okay, good. 
Police report another murder downtown as the body of Russell Barnes 
was found in the back alley not 
far from the Candy Cat Lounge, 
the scene of a gruesome murder 
just days ago. 
I'm sorry, Constance. I 
totally forgot. 
What happened to the guy? 
He was strangled. 
Are you ok? 
Whoa, what are you doing here? 
Where have you been? 
Just now? I was taking care of 
some business. 
Quinn said you were with me. 
Quinn's a bubble head. Now, 
Page 22/29
what's going on with you? 
I've been seeing Ann's life. 
Like I don't know how. 
I can't tell you how, but all I know is that police aren't doing anything. Did you go to the Candy Cat? 
One of the dancers had her 
necklace. And a gun. 
You know that place is 
dangerous. 
I had to for Ann's sake. 
Ann is dead. 
Now, you know how crazy you 
sound right now? 
I thought you understood, but I see you don't. 
Yeah, no kidding. 
Hey, there's been another 
murder downtown. 
Another dancer at the Candy 
Cat... Tina somebody. 
Suffocated. 
My God. 
You stay away from me, okay. 
You're dead! You're dead! 
You're not the delivery guy. 
I know. 
I'm calling the police. 
Go ahead, kid. Call them. 
I'm sure the police would be 
very interested about 
your involvement in a string of murders at the Candy Cat. 
I'm not involved with that. 
This says you are. 
How did you get that? 
None of your business. And what my business is is keeping Constance safe. So are you seeing her or ever 
have anything to do with her, 
it's not going to happen ever 
again. 
Did she... 
Did she send you here? 
Page 23/29

I'm looking out for her. 
You see, she's mine. Not yours. And if I ever have to come back here again for anything 
I'm going to hurt you. 
I'm going to hurt you very bad. Do you understand? 
Yes. 
Good. 
So you stay away from her and you stay away from the Candy Cat. 
And maybe you won't be the next victim. 
Don't hurt Constance. 
Hey! You stay away from her or I will eat your face! 
You got it? Do you got it? 
Yes. 
Good. Lock your door. 
A lot of bad folks out there. 
This is Doctor Samuel Hubbard. I'm not in the office at the 
moment but please leave a message. If it's an emergency, please 
hang up and dial nine-one-one. Doctor Hubbard, it's a friend 
of Constance Turner. 
I don't know what you've been 
telling her, 
or what kind of thoughts you've been filling her head 
with but she's in a very bad 
way right now. 
And I'm holding you personally responsible, 
you got that? 
I can't believe this. 
I have worked so hard to make 
this place what it is 
and somebody is killing all my people. 
Didn't you talk to the police 
yet? 
Yes. I've talked to them twice. Page 24/29

Twice. 
I need somebody to find the son-of-a-bitch and just freaking bury him. 
Maybe I can help you. 
Maybe you can. You hear a lot of things that go around this place, don't you? I do. 
All right, great. Then why don't you tell me and start from the very beginning. Somebody came to my apartment 
today. 
Hey, junior. Thought I'd find 
you here. 
You run this place? 
Who are you? 
I want Constance. Would she 
happen to be here? 
I... I'm sorry. Who? 
Look, I'm real sorry about what's 
been going on in your club. 
But Constance... she's sick and 
her coming here doing... 
well, whatever it is she's doing, 
it's making her paranoid and delusional. So I came by to tell you that 
she has to get away from it. 
Really? Because every time I see her here she's open, she's free and she's happy. So if there's anybody that she probably needs to stay away from... it's you. 
You want a lawsuit? You want a Channel Six news story about what a dive... 
what a dump this place is just 
keep talking. 
You know, I should probably tell 
you that I have been threatened 
by much bigger and better 
people than you. 
So why don't you do us all a favor, turn around, walk out my door and never come back again. Unless, of course, you want a 
lap dance from your girlfriend. 
You got no idea who you're 
messing with, lady. 
Page 25/29
And you have no idea who you're 
dealing with. 
Holy cow, Rikki. That was 
badass. 
Everybody's a tough guy until 
they meet my little friend. 
I brought you an ice cream. 
It's your favorite flavor. 
What do you say? 
All right, then. 
You know, I really 
shouldn't be eating this. 
Once you start dancing naked 
you've got to watch your weight. 
Things have gotten very 
complicated, Julie. 
People keep getting killed and I don't know if they're the right people or not. I mean one of them's got to be guilty, right? I mean what are the chances? I... I just... I don't know 
what to do anymore. 
I'm afraid to leave you alone. 
I mean what would become of you 
if something happened to me. 
I can't leave you alone with 
these strangers. It just wouldn't be right. You've got to know that... 
know how much I love you more 
than anything. 
I love you this much. 
No. I'm sorry. I'm so 
sorry. 
Don't cry. I am so sorry. 
You have one new message.. 
Doctor Hubbard, it's a friend 
of Constance Turner. 
I don't know what you've been 
telling her, 
or what kind of thoughts you've 
been filling her head with 
but she's in a very bad way 
right now. 
And I'm holding you personally 
Page 26/29
responsible, 
you got that? 
Yeah, I got it. 
So, you can see how everything has gotten so complicated that the only real solution is to make sure that every "I" is dotted and "T" is... is crossed. Now, that creates more 
complications, of course, 
but I feel confident that I 
will rise to the task. 
I mean so far so good, right? 
What's the matter? 
No more words of advice. 
No more telling me every move 
to make. 
No more spying on me. No? 
Well, good. 
Because I have had it up to 
here with everybody 
just treating me like I'm some 
kind of child, 
I mean... sorry I'm rambling. 
So, I've got some things I have to tidy up 
so if you'll excuse me I have a late show to get ready for. 
There's someone here to see 
you, Julie. 
I don't know what you're 
expecting 
but this girl hasn't spoken 
since she was operated on. 
I understand that. But this 
point I don't have a choice. 
Julie, Constance is in big 
trouble... really big trouble. 
And I want to help her but I 
can't find her. 
Do you know where she is? 
Julie, if you know anything 
you've got to try to help us. 
Thank you. 
What are you doing here, 
Page 27/29
Constance? 
What does it look like I'm 
doing? 
I'm picking out my costume for 
tonight's show. 
The club is closed. There's no 
one here. 
They'll come. They always come. They'll come to see me. 
No one's coming, Constance. 
And stop calling me Constance. 
She's such a drag, man. 
Who are you? Annie? 
You're funny. 
All that money I paid you to straighten me out and you still don't know who I am. Where's Constance? 
I don't know. 
Maybe she's dead. Maybe I 
killed her. 
Annie, you need help. Let me 
help you. 
Help me? Like you helped my 
sister? 
I don't think so, Sam. 
You're fired. 
My God. 
Constance? 
Did you kill me, Julian? 
Kill you? I didn't kill anybody. You're the only one left. 
How do you explain that? 
I think you killed them, 
Constance. 
I think you killed your own 
sister. 
And then you killed everybody you thought was responsible for what she'd become. Don't call me Constance! 
Why not? 
Because Constance can't live 
with what she's done? 
My name is Annie. 
Annie! Say it! 
Page 28/29
All right. Annie. 
Okay, now what? 
First round's on me. 
Sorry for dragging this out. 
I'm usually a better shot. 
What the hell is going on 
around here? 
I knew I was forgetting someone. Yeah, everybody's a tough guy 
until they meet my little friend. My Gosh. Come on get up. 
Get up on your feet. 
You're ruining my carpet. 
Thank you. You saved my life. 
Well, maybe you should stop 
hanging out at joints like this. You might live longer. 
I swear I'm swearing... I'm 
swearing off strippers. Okay. 
I just want a real relationship and make it last. 
Sorry. Come on.
