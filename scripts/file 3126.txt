Smegma. It's a noun.
(CLEARING THROAT)
"A malodorous, opaque,

You've your space

Still don't have an answer.
Do you think I'm like her?

No, no, no, sweetie, no.
Not like that.
What I mean is, you're smart and funny,
you don't take people's crap.
Well, statistically, if you have a parent
that committed suicide...
Clare, she was a good woman,
but she had a rough childhood.

You farted and you blamed it on me
and everyone called me McFarts
until, like, the sixth grade.
I'm sorry.
Are you really?
Yeah.
Then apology accepted.
But maybe in the multiverse,
it never happened.
Or it did happen and you farted,
blamed it on me and I got called McFarts.

You dig on multiverses?
Yeah, I mean, the theory that,
you know, another you exists

CLARE : Yeah, I don't know anything about it.
And I can't...
I can't really read what it says, but...
Can you open it?
Well, it looks like a
version of a Chinese Wish Pot.
They're pretty common actually.
You take a piece of paper,
write down your wish,
put it in the pot,
and wait for it to come true.
Let's see. This one.
It's heavy.
Okay, it promises to grant seven wishes.
And there are rules.
"Lay your hands upon me."
I guess you have to be touching it
to make a wish?
"Abandon, lose, or sell me
and all your wishes will be undone."
GINA : Huh.
Yeah, and what does... What does this say?
That is not a word. It's a name.
"Lu Mei"?
"The legend of Lu Mei."
"In 1910, bubonic plague swept through
mainland China.
Lu Mei and her family were suspected
of being infected
so they were quarantined in a train car
where they died of heat stroke
and dehydration.
Lu Mei was the only survivor.
Local legend says she took the only
valuable thing the family owned,
a music box, and went to a temple
to pray for revenge.
She prayed for seven days and seven nights
and on the seventh night,
a Yaoguai answered."
"Yaoguai"?
A demon of the Chinese persuasion.
GINA : If you believe in that sort of thing.
It says, "Lu Mei became very wealthy
and her enemies were vanquished.
In 1922, she died.
Suicide.
Opium."
Romantic.
RYAN : So...
what do these numbers mean on the bottom?
I have no idea.
A mystery.
Um... It also says,
"When the music ends..."
something happens.
Like?
I don't know.
It could be a few different things but
my guy Mike at UWA, he's pretty smart, so
I will let you know what he says.

Why do you keep asking me that?
Why don't you answer?
Has it played any music yet?

"A blood price."

the blood price is paid."

Ah, she's, uh...

That wasn't it.
# This path is difficult we travel on #
# Knowing when it's time to move along #
# No we can't stay in the same place #
# Where the light fades away #
# A little every day #
# Take the good and hold it near to you #

- DAD : Clare.
- Oh!
What's going on?
Nothing. I just...
Um...
I think that someone's following me.
- What? Since when?
- Um...
Since I got the music box.
(KNOCKING)
Mrs. Deluca, are you home? It's Clare.
Mrs. Deluca?
Ugh!

Hey. What's up?
- GIRL 1 : So cute.
- GIRL 2 : Beyond cute.
I don't know, Clare.
Why don't you go ask your new friends?
I mean, seriously, I don't get it.
Why is everyone so into you lately?
You're not that special.
Truth.
Hey.
What's wrong?
(SIGHS)
I need to talk to you guys about something.
I don't know what's going on and...
I don't know what to do.
This is it?
Don't... kick... that!
Don't do that! Okay?
Will someone say something?
All right.
I mean, have you ever heard of coincidence?
- Oh, my God!
- That's all this is, Clare.
Coincidence.
JUNE : Yeah, Clare. I don't know.
I'm telling you,
I don't think so. I really don't.
You wanna know what I think, Clare?
Yeah.
I think you're a selfish bowl of bitch sauce.
If I had seven wishes,
you know what I'd have done?
I would have wished for world peace
and I would cure cancer.
I mean, you've used four whole wishes.
- Five wishes.
- Five whole wishes already.
And you didn't wish for anything
for me and June.
Nothing. We're your best friends.
Come on! Like, you didn't think, like...
"Oh, well, I know Meredith wants
an internship at Everest Games
- and June wants to get into Brown."
- You don't believe in this anyway!
- So?
- Guys, are you serious?
Do you think that if...
if I believed this from the very beginning
that I wouldn't have wished for my mom to...
over you guys? I...
JUNE : It's okay. Say it.
Nothing.
Nothing. I just... I don't...
think that I should be wishing anymore.
I think you should throw it away.
Doesn't that make the most sense?
- Just get rid of it.
- Yeah.
It says if I get rid of it,
all of my wishes will be undone.
But if you really think people have died...
aren't you a bad person if you keep it?
(PHONE BEEPS)
Yeah. By "bad person"
June means, "psycho bitch."
MEREDITH : Oh!
Nauseating Norma's outside,
and I'm so over this conversation.
Just throw it away.
You'll feel so much better.
I mean, it hasn't really worked.
I still feel miserable.
JUNE : Toss it and it's done.
You won't have to worry about it anymore.

Junie and I are still alive, dude.

Just ignore her, Clare. So, did you do it?
Did you throw it away?
Yeah, right after you guys left.
- JUNE : Cool.

Yeah. We'll be right back.

CLARE : Ow.
What's this?
Nothing.
Let me see your phone.
Now, or I'm out.
They're just pictures of you.
You're even cute when you're sleeping.
(CHUCKLE)
You've been spying on me.
- Well, yeah.
- What is wrong with you?
Are you mad?
Yes, I'm mad.
You're smokin' when you're mad.
I think maybe that we need a break.
I don't.
I was just trying to be nice.
Paul, I'm breaking up with you.
- I gotta get out of here.
- Clare, wait.
This isn't over. Clare!
(OMINOUS ORIENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)
Where is she? It's about to start.
(SCREAMING)
What? No.
Hey, what happened?
Junebug almost just got barbecued
and I saved her.
MEREDITH : Hey, got ninja, right?
Ow-wah.
(FIREWORKS EXPLODING)
Wait, guys. I just got the first clue.
- Okay, let's go.
- Come on, let's go.
Hey, buddy. It's Dad.
I got a gig outside town so
I'm gonna be home around midnight. Okay?
I love you.
- (LOUD BANG)
- (TIRE SCREECH)
Shit!
- MEREDITH : Come on.
- JUNE : Are you sure?
Yeah, of course I'm sure.
Look.
- What goes up, must come down.
- CLARE : Yes.
You get it? Alright.
Come on, guys, let's get this selfie.
Boom. Five down, five more to go.
Saxon's goin' down tonight.
- All right, where to next?
- (PHONE BEEP)
Oh oh oh!
- Holy... ballsack.
- What?
Malformed Molly's in the building.
Twenty-sixth floor. I gotta go.
Are you kidding me?
Don't hate. Don't hate.
Meredith! Come on!
Clare! Just give me five minutes, alright?
And when I'm back,
Monster Mutant Master. Right here.
Dammit.
I didn't do it.
Do what?
The box. I still have it.
I couldn't throw it away.
That's messed up, Clare.
I know.
I tried, I just... I couldn't do it.

(HEAVY BREATHING)
This is your fault.
All your fault.
Hey, come on.
No.
Come on. Let's get you outta here.
Come on.
You know the number on the box
that we couldn't figure out?
Well, I did.
It's a military ID number belonging to
an airman by the name of Arthur Sands.
That's him.
He was stationed in China
at the end of World War ll.
A few years later he opened up a
very successful car dealership in Jersey.
He lost his best friend in a freak accident.
Here's the kicker.
That's him six months later.
Oh, my God!
After his suicide,
his wife was institutionalized.
She swore a music box
had destroyed her family.
In the last five years or so...
the box resurfaced again in Cleveland,
with a man named Lawrence Hart.
He wins the lottery, marries his high
school sweetheart and has two daughters.
A perfect life.
Until people around him start dying off.
His daughters drowned,
his wife died in a car accident
and Hart lost his mind.
He barricades himself in his house and
that's where he dies, in a massive fire.
You know what's weird?
What's left of his estate is
a few blocks from your house, Clare.
There was another phrase on the box
I don't think you saw.
It was a warning.
"After seven wishes,
the Yaoguai claims the soul."
(SCREAMS)
That's its final price.
(PHONE BEEPS REPEATEDLY)
- Hey.
- What?
How many wishes have you made?
I've made five wishes.
Jesus, Clare.
What the hell is wrong with you?
I'm sorry, but...
"But" how is there a "but?" People are dead!
It was just nice to be normal for a while.
That's your excuse?
What'd you wish for, anyway?
- That nice house?
- No.
Oh now, bullshit! People are dead, Clare.
You can't just wish that away.
You can't take that back.
I know, and I said I was sorry.
I didn't know that any of this would happen.
Know what I wish?
I wish I never met you. That's what I wish.
It's my fault.
And I know that I have to get rid of it.
Will you please help me?
Please, Ryan?
(SIGHS)
Okay, let's do it.
Okay.
(METALLIC CLANG)
(YELLS)
Bitch!
(PANTS)
She was my best friend, Clare.
I'm sorry.
(FAINT TINKLING)
(SCREAMS)
What are you doing here?
PAUL : Why haven't you answered my texts?
You need to leave right now.
What if I said...
I don't want to live without you.
And I don't want you...
to live without me.
Please. Just, just leave.
- So, we're done?
- Oh, my God!
Yes.
(GASP)
I love you, Clare.
(SCREAMS)
RYAN : Where is it?
CLARE : What, what do you mean?
I don't know.
It's...
I don't know. It was right there last night.
It was right in there. I...
Oh...
What does that mean?
I...
Maybe it's done with you.
Maybe it's over.
Well, what now? What would I do? What...
You move on with your life.
You can do it.
That's easy to say, Ryan.
No, it's easy to wish.
I liked it. I liked having it.
It made me feel special.
Is there anything you wished for
that you can't live without?
- No.
- See, you don't need it.
(DOOR BELL RINGS)
Dad?
What's going on?
Well, it was fun while it lasted.
It's unbelievable. I mean, who forgets
to pay their taxes for ten years?
Your mother's crazy Uncle August.
Well, here we are.
Home sweet home.
# You're a curse #
# A disease, and I caught it #
# Like a drug, slowly pulsing #
Happy birthday, Clare.
# And I don't want it anymore #
# My feet on the dash, take a drag #
# I go round #
You've gotta be fucking kidding me.
# Wondering why you don't gain #
# I'll stay this way for longest way #

Mmmm, hot.

You stole it?
You couldn't get rid of it.
You saw what it did to Meredith.
I'm just trying to protect you, okay?
Okay, so you think that you can control it.
You think you can, Clare?
Really?
Are you crazy?
Why would you bring it here
in the first place?
'Cause I have two little sisters at home.
Give it back. Right now.
After everything that's happened?
Yes, June.
What's wrong with you?
No! Clare, no, stop it. Clare!
You see what it's done. This is a bad idea.
- June, go away.
- Stop, listen to me! Just stop!
Clare, come on! No, no, no. Clare, come here.
- Just give it to me, Clare. Stop.
- Let go, June!
- Let go! Let go!
- RYAN : Clare?
- RYAN : Clare!
- JUNE : No!
June?
June? Is she going to be okay?
What is wrong with you?
Clare?
- Go away!
- I thought we were done with this.
I'm not ready yet.
You can't keep it. You know that.
- You have to get rid of it!
- You don't understand.
I'm not ready yet!
What about everything we talked about?
I won't wish anymore, okay?
Okay, it'll be fine. I just won't wish.
I'm gonna hang on to it for a while.
Clare, please, you're not hearing yourself.
You can't control it. It's controlling you!
Go away! Okay?
Please go away.
I have two wishes left
and if you do not go away,
I will use one on you,
I swear I'll use it on you.
Go away!
You can't keep running from this!
I know, I know what to do.
(PHONE RINGS)
I know, I know what to do,
I know when to... Okay.
Okay.
(PHONE STILL RINGING)
If I had... No.
If I just don't make any more wishes,
everything will be fine.
(HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER)
Everything will be fine.
DAD : Clare? School just called.
(PHONE RINGS)
DAD : Clare? What's going on?
Get down here!
Okay.
I have two wishes left.
I have two wishes left.

I wish my mother never committed suicide.
Oh, God.

Mom?

I missed you so much!
You missed me so much? What?

I know how to beat you!
I wanna go back!
I wanna go back before I got you!
I wanna go back.
My final wish is I wanna go back
to the morning my dad found you.
I wanna go back right now!

MEREDITH : I'm not awake right now.
- What do you want?
- Nothing. Hi.
I just wanted to, you know, hear your voice.
Seriously? You don't need a kidney
or some ridiculous words of wisdom?
- No, I just, no...
- Alright, you know
- I'm gonna go back to sleep, okay? Night!
- Okay, okay.
Dad!
- Hey!
- Hey. What's all this?
Um, nothing. I just... um I was just
wondering if I could go with you guys.
You know, like old times.
- Yeah. Get in.
- Awesome.
Sure, it'll be like old times.
Be our good luck charm.
MRS. DELUCA : Aw, you look so nice.
(SINISTER RUMBLING)
Clare, you find anything?
I found...
I found these. I don't know
what you could use them for.
Maybe around the house?
I don't know, they're kind of neat.
- Yeah, I can do something with these.
- Yeah?
Hey, Carl. Check it out.
Told you my kid has an eye.
You always were my good luck charm.
You gotta come with us again.
Yeah, maybe I will.
I have to get to school,
but have fun today. Love you.
Love you too, buddy.
- CLARE : Yeah, thank you so much.
- CARL : You got it.
RYAN'S FRIEND : Let's go buddy.
CLARE : Ryan! Ryan, hey.
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Uh, sure.
Okay, um...
First off, I just wanted to say, um...
I'm sorry for the whole McFarts thing.
Wait. What? Really?
Yeah. Um...
But you know what, maybe in the
multiverse, that didn't happen.
- Hold on, you dig on multiverses?
- Yeah.
And, also, maybe in the multiverse,
we're really good friends.
Maybe... we're even dating.
Well... have we done it?
No, not yet.
I have also met your cousin, Gina.
Hung out in her loft and everything.
Okay, you're freaking me out right now.
Yeah, good.
'Cause I need a favor.
Okay, this is gonna sound crazy but...
please don't open this.
Just... just bury it. No shortcuts.
Uh... okay.
What's in it for me?
Dinner, if you want?
And maybe we could talk more
on this whole multiverse thing?
Yeah, and you can tell me how you
know my cousin and that she has a loft.
- Done.
- Cool.
Dude!
(LAUGHS)
I'll see you around.
(TIRES SCREECH)
(SHOUTING, SCREAMING)
I didn't see her.
I just didn't see her.
