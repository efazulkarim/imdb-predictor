BEDTIME STORY FLASHBACK: INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

We reveal MOM playing the part of the woman spy. Cool and
casual as she scopes out the comers and goers while military
troops patrol the area.Snethen sees him: GREGORIO CORTEZ,
Secret Agent of the Basque Regime stationed in South America.
Tall, rugged, with a THIN MOUSTACHE. He stops at a chauffeur
holding a sign: "HOMBRE." .
MOM (V .O.)
She tracked her target down at an
international airport on his way back
from a mission in Chile. She followed him
to his hotel •
. CORTEZ rides the.HOTEL ELEVATOR. Mom follows, taking another.
We're on her unreadable expression as she rides the lift.
MOM (V.O.)
But when the moment finally came to carry
out her mission ••• She found that she
couldn't go through with it.
CARMEN (V .O.)

Why?
MOM (V.O.)
He was different from what she expected.

Cortez reaches into his own jacket. Mom looks doomed. He
pulls out a picture of HER. She gives him a vulnerable look.
He pushes the Lobby button on the elevator and waves goodbye.

MOM (V.O.)
But unexpectedly honorable. And it made
her realize that years of working with
detached emotions had taken its toll.
She wears a confused expression as she floats through the
lobby, leaving the hotel in a daze.
MOM (V.O.)
So they kept contact. Began to talk. On
the phone mostly. A few lunch dates, very discreet. After all they were from
different sides, and could never be seen
together.
They eat alone at different tables in an outdoor open patio
food court. They speak to each other through their wristwatches. Sharing laughs, jokes. They toast each other from
across the patio without looking at each other. Just
listening to the sound of each other's voice, and enjoying their distant company.
MOM (V,O.)
Dinner ¢ates followed, all over the
world, wherever their mutual travels took
them.
They stand at opposite ends of the Eifel Tower, looking out
over the romantic city below. Laughing and talking softly.
MOM
They fell in love. And decided to do
something that was considered very
dangerous in those times. Something
insane and almost unheard of.
CARMEN
What?
MOM (V.O.) They decided to marry.
CARMEN (V .O.)
Wow.
MOM (V.O.) Oh yes. On her wedding day she felt like
she'd rather brave a thousand deadly missions than go through what she was
about to.attempt.
She paces nervously in the back room of the wedding house.

MOM

Marriage is a mission so complex that
only the most courageous, and slightly insane need apply.

She's so worked up that she karate chops a huge nearby
statue, breaking it into several chunks. She checks her hand.
Nothing. Nervously, she puts it back together.
MOM (V.O.) . There is such an amazing series of
obstacles that one must navigate in order
to keep a marriage together, much less a
family ••• that it frightened even her: a
hardened and experienced secret agent.
The Wedding March begins. She places the statue's head on
it's knees, straightens her wedding gown and marches outside
and down the aisle quite fast. Someone in the crowd motions
for her to slow down. She does, poising herself as well.
MOM (V.O.)
But when she saw him standing there,
without any sign of doubt whatsoever •..
So assured of his decision, so enamored
with what they were about to do •••
A majestic yet tasteful outdoor wedding, overlooking a
cliffside into the ocean. At cliff's edge is the wedding
dais. HE waits for her. Smiling. Standing beside him is his
best man FELIX and second best man DONNAGON.
MOM (V.O.)
She took his hand- and looked deep into
his eyes.
They share this amazing moment of absolute clarity.
MOM (V.O.) And said the two most dangerous, most
trusting words you can say to anyone.
We see her mouth the words.

Angry military choppers fly close overhead. The wedding party
is covered-with red laser targeting beams. Everyone scrambles
as the wedding is overturned by the torrential winds. We see
this accented in still B&W wedding photographs.
MOM (V.O.)
Most of their guests were also secret
agents, and didn't want to be recognized.
Guests cover their faces with napkins while making their
getaways. Stumbling and scattering.
MOM (V.O.}
The cake was a mess, the decorations •••
everything was shot.
Mom grabs two small fanny packs from under the cake table and
straps them on hers and her husband's back. They make a
running leap off the huge cliff.
MOM (V.O.)
Their flair for showmanship came in
handy, allowing them to make a quick
getaway to their Honeymoon Boat.
Their fanny packs explode as red, heartshaped parachutes
emerge- allowing them a graceful landing into a decorated
speed boat. The Pastor is getting roughed up by a mysterious
man at cliff's edge but manages to yell his pronouncement of
"Man and Wife." The mysterious man turns angrily at the

Your new secret identities. Floop thought you'd be his most popular toys. He could
see you in theme parks, lunch boxes,

Minion picks up the sculptures.
MINION
You should be so lucky.
Minion distorts them even more. Twisting the clay into
HIDEOUS CREATURES. He then connects them to the wires that
are attached to the domes over the parents heads. He clicks
a few switches on the machine. It screams to life.
