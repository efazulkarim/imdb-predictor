[quiet dramatic music]

[man 1]

The shipment is already in transit.

[speaking foreign language]

Let's just say that might have

regrettable consequences.

[phone beeps]

I wouldn't. Open your safe.

I'll pay you a lot of money to walk away.

Shut up. Open the safe.

- Who do you work for? CIA?

- Hurry up.

[safe beeping and unlocking]

[henchman speaking in Japanese]

k*ll her!

[grunting]

[tense music playing]

[speaking in Japanese]

Someone!

[speaking in Japanese]

Don't walk! Quick!

[speaking in Japanese]

The woman's up there!

[speaking in Japanese]

Up there! k*ll her!

[speaking in Japanese]

Catch that b*tch!

[g*nshots]

[water splashing]

[airplane flying overhead]

[door unlocks]

[man] Come on.

We both know how long these things take.

We need get it through customs.

Now, I'm working

on getting another shipment.

But without the support

from the consulate at the UN

we have no chance

of that happening on time.

I know, but we don't have time for that.

They're in the middle

of a malaria outbreak.

I'm working on another shipment,

but we have to get

what we have through customs now.

I'm gonna call you back.

Hey, you.

Are you early or am I late?

Hey.

- I missed you.

- I missed you, too.

Happy anniversary. Come see.

- Wait, that's too much.

- When we went on that wine run,

it was in the shop next door.

I saw you looking at it.

- My turn.

- No, no, no.

I need a redo gift.

I'm embarrassed. No, no, no.

My... My... My gift.

Big in Japan.

[chuckles]

I love 'em.

They're my new favourite pant.

Although I do think that year two

is cotton. Three is leather.

[Avery] Oh, you're so much better

at this than me.

Try this.

Wow. You really cracked out

the good stuff.

You're too good to me,

you know that?

Ain't it great?

And this is the last piece.

- Ah! How cute.

- They need a home.

Think about their little tails wagging.

Their hot breath on you in the morning.

No, no, I can't. I can't be trusted

to keep something alive.

I almost k*lled the both of us

with that omelette I made.

Well, they only eat kibble,

so you'll be fine.

Don't worry. We'll build up to it.

Let's get you fed.

No. Can I please just take you to

dinner? My treat. I got to redeem myself.

I love the pants.

I'm gonna wear them to dinner.

- Okay.

- Let's go.

[Avery] Hm. This is an interesting route

to the restaurant.

- [David] Oh, really?

- [Avery] Yeah.

Feels like it's almost intentionally

out of the way.

- That's just in your head.

- Obviously, I have Alzheimer's.

Okay. I'm on to you. Sneaky way

to the proposal spot. Romantic stroll.

You really want that puppy, huh?

I have no idea what you're talking about.

- I resent all these accusations.

- You're the sickest person.

Do you remember that dinner we had

- with that German doctor we met in Iraq?

- Mm-hm.

He and I are going to New York

in a few weeks to raise some funds

and recruit some doctors.

And I thought you could come.

Finally take a proper holiday.

An actual vacation together.

It's been so long. I would love that.

Great.

It'd be great. You could show us

all your old college stomping grounds.

First kiss. Your first everything.

[Avery]

We're gonna need a longer vacation.

[David laughing]

[Avery] Besides my glory days,

what else is on the touristy menu?

[David] Well, I'm still working out

some of the finer details.

- [Avery] Which are?

- [David] Like the Chelsea Hotel,

champagne, clothing optional.

[Avery] Mm, okay.

Now you're piquing my interest.

[music playing on speakers]

- [Avery] Babe, is my phone out there?

- Yeah.

- You feeling all right?

- I am tired.

Trip took it out of me a little bit.

Why don't you stay home

from work today? Work from home?

I mean, bed. I mean...

I mean, let's just go back to bed.

That sounds so good.

I'd almost k*ll for that.

- Do you have plans this weekend?

- Not set in stone.

Okay. Don't make any.

- Bye.

- Bye.

[people chattering]

[knock on door]

Hey, how was the trip?

Views were incredible. Some of

the people could have been friendlier.

Hm. And the client?

Oh, I left him speechless.

- Hmm.

- Hmm. Oh.

Hey, a token of my appreciation.

For everything.

Ave, you shouldn't have.

- Oh!

- Don't worry. It's a knock-off.

It's beautiful. Thank you.

Thanks. How's Maggie?

Homesick. Lucky you married

a European. How are you and David?

Great. Except my anniversary gift

was a disaster.

Why didn't you tell me

there was some kind of gift list thing?

There is?

Next year's fruit.

Hey, don't beat yourself up.

You're doing fine.

Every marriage takes effort,

especially in our world.

You got plenty of time

to work out the kinks.

I tell you what. Why don't you let David

and I take you and Maggie for dinner?

Maybe she can share

some marriage pointers with me.

Oh, I'm sure she's got a whole bunch.

I'm proud of you, Ave.

We've come a long way

since Kandahar.

[door buzzing then unlocks]

- Blake.

- [Blake] Yes, sir.

We have lots to discuss.

[people chattering]

Pull up the files Avery got from Japan.

- Yes, sir.

- Let's go private and fire it up.

Pull up the intel in Kenji's black book.

Business firms

used for w*apon shipments.

Officials he was paying off.

t*rror1st networks he was supplying.

But the drive had a lot more than that

on it. Kali fulfilled a contract for him.

He's been deviating from his M.O.

for the last year.

Pull up the Triad file.

When you were in Japan, this went down

in Krakow, courtesy of the Russian mob.

Looks like the Triads were encroaching

on their customers.

Guess who's responsible?

Kali did another hit for the Russians?

Why is a top assassin solely taking

contracts for the Russian mob?

He also put a b*llet in the head of

two undercover agents in South Africa.

Maybe this will help us identify him.

That would be one hell of a coup.

Good work, Agent Graves.

Finish your report,

and take the rest of the day.

Thank you, sir.

- Pull up Kali's file.

- [Blake] Yes, ma'am.

[Avery] Arms dealers, drug runners.

All low grade targets.

Why are you deviating?

- Hi, neighbour.

- Hey, Abby.

Missed you at the gym

the last few days.

- Business trip.

- I'm jealous.

Hey, where did you go?

Someplace fun?

- Hi, Avery.

- Niklaus.

Missed you at the gym.

Hey, you and David want to come over

for dinner this weekend?

We have plans.

Don't be a stranger.

Hey, I'm home.

[quiet suspenseful music]

Honey?

Hey, I've been thinking

about our New York trip.

I've got a few ideas.

[gasps]

[phone ringing]

Who is this?

[unknown voice]

You're home early, Agent Graves.

Where's my husband?

Located in your sister CIA black site

is detainee number 0912749.

Hidden in his fake tooth is a file.

You are going to steal it for me.

You have nine hours to get me what I want

if you want to see your husband alive.

I want proof of life.

Once you have the file.

No. Proof of life or he's already dead.

And this phone call is over.

[David] Avery...

- [groaning]

- [gasping]

David, listen to me!

[unknown voice]

There's your proof.

You touch him again, I will break

every bone in your f*cking body.

There's a phone booth in an alleyway.

It will ring at midnight.

If you don't answer it

with the Canary Black file in hand,

your husband dies.

Failure to comply, as well as

any involvement from your agency,

will result in his execution.

[phone vibrating]

- Hello?

- [Avery] Sorina, it's me.

- I need a favour.

- f*ck your favours.

A favour is a ride to the airport.

Not the usual bullshit you ask me to do.

You're a hacker.

Don't pretend just because you got

a real job, you suddenly have morals.

I'm at work.

Call one of your agency hacks.

No, this needs to be off the books.

Are you gonna do it?

Or am I telling the Russian FSB

about the time you hacked their servers?

Good.

I need you to ping the location of

the last incoming call to this cell phone.

Hang on.

The phone's a burner.

It's on the south side.

But I need more time

to triangulate the exact location.

As soon as I have it,

I'll text you the address.

So, are we good?

[Avery] Hurry.

I sent you home early so you could

at least pretend to have a life.

You know me.

[typing on keyboard]

09... 749.

Come on, please.

[cell phone beeping]

[dramatic music]

[cell phone ringing]

[cell phone ringing]

Yeah.

[unknown voice] You're not following

my instructions, Agent Graves.

Well, that's a character flaw of mine.

[unknown voice] You think I didn't know

that you'd try to trace the call?

You just stepped on a pressure

activated expl*sive device.

Take a step and you lose your life.

- I'm listening.

- Then do exactly as you're told.

Your psych file is quite a read,

Agent Graves. "Psychologically astute.

"Prone to self-reliance,

"she's uniquely suitable as a lone wolf

due to her lack of a family unit

"and comfortability with high pressure

situations and covert identities.

"And a case history

of zero failed missions."

If anyone can get me the file, it's you.

So now that we've bonded, I'm assuming

you're gonna disarm this b*mb.

[unknown voice] There is a price

for disobeying instructions.

You're expendable.

Show me progress

and get me Canary Black.

Get to work, Agent Graves.

Tick tock.

[phone beeps off]

[suspenseful music]

[suspenseful music builds]

Bouncing Betty, you as*h*le.

[expl*si*n rumbling]

[loud expl*si*n]

[pedestrians screaming]

[coughing]

[dramatic music]

[car engine starts]

[brakes screech]

[indistinct chattering]

[key reader beeps]

[door buzzes]

Can I help you, Agent Graves?

I need to talk to Agent Maxfield.

Service w*apon.

Security protocol.

No outside weapons on site.

[door buzzes]

Maxfield.

What can I do for you, Agent Graves?

I believe detainee CPD0912749

has actionable intel

related to the case I'm assigned to.

I highly doubt that.

He's way above your pay grade.

An arms dealer tried to bargain with intel

he says he received from your detainee.

What intel?

He said it involved

an assassin named Kali.

I need to know what his connection is.

What did this detainee do exactly?

He got his hands on a top secret,

sensitive compartmented information file.

The scope of this breach is deadly.

What's he doing here?

Enjoying fewer rights

than if we took him to Guantanamo.

You don't get answers

by asking politely with a lawyer present.

We renditioned him here after we

caught him trying to get to Odessa.

You guys probably have baggage then.

Might be faster if I go in by myself.

I'll be in the other room... monitoring.

[door shuts]

Mr Stoica.

I recently met with

a friend of yours in Japan.

Kenji Nakajima.

I don't know who that is.

Well, he knows you. According to him,

you backchannelled a meeting

because you had something to sell.

He didn't want g*ns.

Pull up Agent Graves' file.

[Avery]

He wanted cash and lots of it.

I can help you,

but this is a two-way street.

I heard the two of you discussed a file.

Canary Black.

Is this Agent Maxfield's idea?

Look around.

I'm the friendliest face in here.

So why don't you tell me about the file,

and then I can help you.

f*ck you, you American c**t.

[Avery] f*ck you!

sh*t!

[choking]

I'm taking that file.

[groaning]

Where is it?

What the hell are you doing?

You don't pull that sh*t on my detainee.

Improvising.

We good?

[shouting] You just k*lled your career,

Agent Graves!

[Maxfield]

Fix him up.

- [woman on phone] Go ahead.

- Get me Station Chief Hedlund.

Okay.

[shouting] She has the file!

Lock it down!

[alarm beeping]

[CIA agent 1]

Hey, stop!

[CIA agent 2]

Graves, down...

[CIA agent 3]

Don't move! Don't move!

Agent Graves, only way

you're leaving here is on a stretcher.

- Put the knife down.

- Not happening, Maxfield.

Read the room.

Open the door. Open the door.

[dramatic music]

f*ck!

Hunt her down. She's a threat

to national security.

[plane engine rumbling]

[quiet dramatic music]

- Redirect the plane.

- [man] Yes, sir.

[computer alert beeping]

What the...?

[cell phone ringing]

Deputy Director Evans.

Yes, sir. Just came over the wire now.

Yes, sir.

Agent Maxfield, I put you in charge

of finding Canary Black,

and it was right under your nose

the whole time.

I need a blow by blow

of what happened. Who is she?

My best, sir.

Her father worked for the agency.

Her mother was from the UK.

Both deceased. She was groomed

since she was 18.

Aced Langley,

passed the Wintertide programme

and pulled the Omar Jaziri job in Iraq.

There's no way that she's a traitor, sir.

That's exactly what she is right now.

You mark my words, Hedlund,

she's going in the ground

and you're the one

that's gonna put her there.

Yes, sir. What file are we after?

Canary Black.

It's a top-secret master list of blackmail

material for all government personnel.

We built it to keep track

of pressure points

foreign governments might use

to flip our people

into spies.

Legal, illegal, everything.

From the highest office

in the land to, uh...

Well, you, Hedlund.

That affair you had four years ago.

It's on the list.

If our enemies get their hands on this,

it will jeopardise

the very office of the president

and every department below it.

You have carte blanche to contain this.

[quiet dramatic music]

[typing on phone]

[phone dialling]

[groaning]

[Avery]

I'm taking that file.

I don't understand.

She played you, Hedlund.

You're just too close to her to see it.

Where would she go?

She's a ghost if she wants to be.

- And her husband?

- Doesn't know who she is.

David Brooks, civilian.

Works in logistics and finance

for Doctors Without Frontiers.

A British national.

He's the only family she's got.

Besides you.

Okay. Bring him in.

Scrape her husband's phone calls, texts,

e-mails, credit cards,

and get me a map of where he's been.

- [CIA tech] Yes, sir.

- She has to trust someone.

[dogs barking in the distance]

Sir, his cell has been

off the grid for hours,

and he has an ATM withdrawal

in Vienna.

There was also a flight

booked this morning

under his name and Miss Olga Mirav.

That's one of her aliases.

It leaves Vienna in three hours for Rome.

He's on the run with her.

- Get me teams stationed at both airports.

- [CIA tech] Yes, sir.

[cell phone ringing]

Honey, this isn't the right time.

It's me.

Someone kidnapped David.

They want the Canary Black file.

But there was no file.

This could be Kali.

Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

I won't be home till late.

If I could know the contents,

maybe I can figure out who has David,

but it's beyond my clearance.

You know,

you really should get some rest.

This file is the only chance I have

of saving him.

Hey, don't worry about the dishes.

I'll do them when I get home.

Go to my house. See for yourself.

Yeah.

I am not a traitor.

Love you, too.

[phone beeps off]

- Everything okay?

- Yeah. Yeah.

It's the wife.

A bit under the weather.

[quiet melancholic music]

It's okay, Maggie.

I'm sure Jarvis will sort it out.

[dramatic music]

I have a set...

of keys.

[Maxfield]

Downstairs.

Ever consider the husband

was taken and the file is a ransom?

All this is a setup.

If that were the case,

she would have brought us in.

Rule number one

for a kidnap and ransom.

Tear this place apart.

- [people chattering]

- [upbeat pop music]

[speaking in French]

You weren't answering your phone.

[speaking in French]

So you show up in person?

[speaking in French]

I need your help. Please.

I don't conduct business here.

I don't have time for decorum.

I'm f*cked.

By who?

By whoever's blackmailing me.

And now my own agency, which is nice.

- And you're looking for safe passage?

- Information.

Get me a list of every foreign agent,

assassin and intel broker

- that's currently in town.

- That's expensive.

I have the cash in my safe house.

I'll pay you when it's done.

Also, I need you to go shopping.

Avery, coming here you're burning

a bridge. I hope it's worth it.

[quiet suspenseful music]

[door unlocks]

[g*nsh*t]

[phone vibrating]

[unknown voice]

Any sign of her?

I'd ask him,

but there's a hole in his face.

[unknown voice sighs] Well, well, well.

Aren't we ambitious, Agent Graves?

Looks like I chose

the right woman for the job.

Just trying to crack that glass ceiling.

[unknown voice] I took the liberty

of cashing out your rainy day fund.

Consider it a tax for jerking me around.

- Bring me the file.

- Your intel was wrong. There was no file.

[unknown voice] Are you sure

that's the game you want to play?

Look, the tooth was empty.

Either you got it wrong or he ditched it

before they caught him.

Hello?

[phone beeping]

[David groaning]

Listen to me. Listen to me!

I don't have it, but I can get it.

I just need some time.

[unknown voice] Stoica had the file,

which means you have the file,

which is why your agency is after you.

It's 8:00 pm. That gives you four hours.

- No, I need more...

- [busy signal]

[typing on keyboard]

[text notification beep]

[tram bell rings]

Jesus Christ, Avery,

this is one hell of a mess.

I couldn't involve you.

You know that's impossible.

I had no choice.

They have my classified psych file.

They know everything about me.

Everyone's looking for you.

Deputy Director himself is flying in

to oversee the hunt.

Your house was clean.

David's made transactions in Vienna.

He bought two tickets, one with

your alias and we can't find him.

- Because he's been kidnapped.

- It's not the way it looks.

Of course, it's not how it looks.

It's how they want it to look.

They're setting me up to take the fall.

What the f*ck is Canary Black?

It's a blackmail list.

The kompromat on everyone

in government with security clearance.

I'm on that list, Avery.

Even if you did have the file,

you couldn't make the exchange,

you know that.

- But, David...

- I know.

People like us need people

like David and Maggie.

- I can't lose him, Jarvis.

- We'll find him.

[tyres screeching]

You've just got David k*lled.

They were gonna k*ll you.

I won't let that happen.

On the ground, now!

Get the f*ck off me.

- Give me the file.

- I never had it.

Let's go.

[dramatic music]

[cars accelerating]

Did you already make the transfer?

Who were you working with?

Who's the buyer? How did you know

about the file? Answer me!

I'm gonna take pleasure

in breaking you down, traitor.

How patriotic of you.

[tyres screeching]

sh*t. sh*t.

[CIA agent]

Maxfield, we got company.

Get us to base camp.

Protect the asset at all cost.

[CIA agent]

They're boxing us in.

Get us out of here.

[device beeping]

[expl*si*n]

[device beeping]

- [Maxfield] Don't stop!

- [CIA agent] Car in pursuit.

Requesting immediate backup.

[g*nf*re]

[grunts]

[car alarm sounding]

[quiet dramatic music]

[grunting]

[dramatic music builds]

[knife swishing]

[masked assailant]

Give me the file.

Niklaus. Where's David?

Niklaus, where is he?

[choking]

Who are you working for?

Niklaus, give me a name.

[phone camera clicks]

[phone vibrating]

[Abby]

Rurik, are you okay? Rurik, answer me.

[Evans] By carte blanche, I didn't mean

create an international incident.

I have to temper the blowback

on this now with my counterpart.

It's one woman, dammit.

Just find her. We're going to the NSS.

Her husband never showed

at the airport in Vienna.

Like I said,

maybe she's been compromised.

More like her accomplices were worried

we snagged her

and her husband is in hiding.

I'm not buying it.

She betrayed you.

If that's not something you can handle,

then I can talk to Deputy Director Evans

and have you relieved.

Consider the angles.

And consider why the hell

none of these people have files.

Sir, police just found another body.

I'm pulling up the image.

That's Avery's neighbour.

Then we've got a sleeper cell

in our outfit.

Your outfit.

[shouting] I want to know

who the hell these people are.

Rurik is dead.

I should have been there.

Soldiers die. That's the job.

- You've failed.

- We stopped them from getting her.

And now she's back on the run

with the file.

Once we get the file...

you'll have your revenge.

Thanks for the quick turnaround

and the gear.

Be thankful that I even showed.

I'm told Deputy Director Evans

just flew in to personally deal with you.

Good timing.

Do you have a list of names for me?

What's that? A tip?

My safe house was torched.

I don't go out of pocket for anyone.

They have a knack for dying

before paying the freight.

I can tell you who orchestrated

the assassination attempt

on the French ambassador last month.

I wouldn't be very good at my job

if I didn't already know that, would I?

I can give you access to a drop box for

a Russian cell operating out of the UK.

Give me the Rolls Royce of intel

or find yourself another patron saint.

Kenji Nakajima's dealmaker

on the UN Security Council.

Pierre Delacourt.

His cut is routed through

his wife's Panamanian shell corporation.

The Kruger brothers are here.

Vanya Stover, Stavros the Greek, Kali.

Kali's in town?

That's the rumour.

They say he owes.

The Russians said that.

If anybody's capable of this, it's him.

There's not a debt in the world

this file couldn't pay off.

What about this guy?

He called himself Niklaus,

but his name's Rurik. Austrian.

He and his wife were my neighbours

for the past eight months.

His name is Rurik van Klaus.

Private contractor.

He worked in Chechnya,

Libya, Ukraine.

How does the CIA not have him on file?

Ghosts live longer.

I picked up your shopping list.

Don't call me again.

- [aide] Deputy Director Evans?

- Yeah.

Sorry to keep you waiting.

Director Breznov will see you now.

- Okay, let's go. Wait here.

- Yes, sir.

[knock on door]

Thank you for seeing me

on such short notice.

As you know, we have an issue

that needs containment.

You have a rogue agent

on foreign soil. My soil.

It's your turf.

We want to handle this diplomatically.

Your agency had a gunfight

in the middle of the city.

I have dead bodies, burned out cars

and zero patience

for your version of events.

You'll find we're very generous

to our friends.

And this agent. What did she do?

She stole top secret information.

What exactly do you have in mind?

We work together to hunt her down.

In the light of bilateral cooperation

and preferential treatment,

I accept your offer.

But when she's caught, I want to be

the first one to interrogate her.

[tram bell ringing]

[gentle piano music playing

in the background]

[speaking with British accent] Hello.

I'd like a room for two nights, please.

And preferably

the west side of the third floor.

Can't get enough of that view.

- That shouldn't be a problem. Miss?

- Olivia Oxley.

[dramatic music]

[phone vibrating]

[dramatic music]

Stop f*cking interrupting me then!

Keep up appearances.

Anyone asks,

it's a pre-scheduled meeting with Breznov

regarding international

intelligence protocols.

- I'll be working from my room.

- Yes, sir.

Goodnight, sir.

[dramatic music]

[muffled dialogue]

You're wearing a mute mask.

[muffled] Help! Get in here!

Scream, shout. It won't matter.

It controls the decibel level

of your voice.

Stoica didn't have the file.

Nor did I betray my country.

[muted]

What do you call this?

Last resort. Somebody kidnapped

my husband to get it.

If that's true, then I'm telling you

we can handle this together.

There's more than one life

at stake here.

No one knows what's at stake here

more than I do.

I don't think you do.

You turn over that file,

you're both dead. I promise you.

You have the file

and you're gonna give it to me.

I get my husband back.

You get your little file back.

Password?

Agent Graves,

keep your emotions in check.

Use your g*dd*mn head.

I'm giving you one chance to walk away.

I assume you've heard

of the Wintertide programme.

The PSYOP stress test.

What about it?

I survived it.

You want to know what they found?

That you're a crazy b*tch?

We're not really using that word

to describe women anymore,

especially in the workplace.

There's been a whole thing.

What they found is that I have

an extremely high tolerance for pain.

Are you willing to find out how much pain

you can take, Deputy Director Evans?

I'm your g*dd*mn superior.

How dare you threaten me?

I appreciate the bravado

as much as the next girl.

I will hunt you

to the ends of the earth for this.

I'm having kind of a shitty day, sir,

so I'm really gonna need the next words

out of your mouth to be,

"My password is..."

I, Nathan Evans,

do solemnly swear to support,

defend the Constitution

of the United States

against all enemies,

foreign and domestic...

[howls in pain]

Jesus f*cking Christ!

Password?

Victory, Maker, Charlie,

3-0-9-1.

[screams] God!

Keep this up, I'm gonna move on

to something you're really gonna hate.

Archer, Dexter, Travis, 2-2-3-8.

Like I said,

foreign and domestic.

Now you're just pissing me off, sir.

This is a remote detonator.

I'm gonna ask you one more time

for your password.

If you lie to me again, I'm going to

blow your f*cking head off.

[muted shouts]

Canary Black is Armageddon.

You'll destroy the world as we know it.

[detonator beeping]

Password?

Bravo, Delta, Zulu, 5-7-2-3.

It won't do you any good. You can

only access the file on a secure server.

[computer beeping]

You're a smart one.

[typing on phone]

[phone vibrating]

- Hello?

- Sorina, I have one more job for you.

I need you to find the nearest

secure server with CIA access.

This is the last time.

[phone ringing]

Jarvis speaking.

Jarvis, I need your help.

This is gonna put you in a bad spot.

That's gonna be tricky.

The anvil's dropping. About earlier...

I need the blueprints

for PLK Technologies.

The defence contractor.

They have a military contract

with the DOD.

It means they have a secure server

to send top secret material.

You realise what you're asking?

They'll trace it back to me immediately.

- It's treason.

- You're the only one I can ask.

I'll see what I can do.

[Avery]

This could be Kali.

Yep. Yep. That's the deal. Payment

for any intel leading to her capture.

You've always believed in me.

Believe in me now.

Hey. Thanks for showing up.

Like I had a choice.

Let's just get this over with.

What's the plan?

Go in and shoot up the place.

Not if I can help it.

Ten minutes. In and out.

The drone is a prototype.

Autonomy sucks. Still has some glitches.

I'll bring it back.

Just give me a warning.

Are you trying to steal industrial secrets

or something?

I left my purse inside.

Lock decoder. Earpiece.

- Are you ready?

- One minute.

Come on, Jarvis. Come through.

[phone notification beep]

- Let's go.

- Okay.

[drone whirring]

[quiet dramatic music]

- Com check.

- Loud and clear. Take me up.

- You hanging in there?

- Save the jokes.

[Avery]

Come and get me in ten.

Come on, come on, come on.

[door beeps]

[beeping]

[muted]

sh*t. Oh, sh*t.

Oh, Christ. Help!

[suspenseful music]

[muted yells]

[beeping]

Somebody get in here now!

I don't know why he's not answering, sir.

I'm almost at his room. Did he leave?

- No, ma'am.

- [knocking]

- Open the door.

- [door beeps]

- [Evans, muted] Hey!

- Director Evans!

Get the mask. Get the mask.

- Get this b*mb off of me!

- [woman] f*ck.

Your badge was just used to access

a secure server at PLK Technologies, sir.

It's Agent Graves!

She's stealing Canary Black.

k*ll access to the server. Inform PLK

Technologies they've been breached.

Server room breach. Lock it down.

[alarms blaring]

Change of plan.

Get that drone in the air, now.

Uh, okay.

Just... Just give me a second.

[drone whirring]

It's a big building.

Where am I going?

[Avery]

I need that drone on the 34th floor.

Eastside hallway window.

[agent] Freeze! Don't move!

- [yells indistinct]

- I need that drone, now!

[grunts]

[Sorina]

sh*t.

sh*t.

No, no, no, no, no, no.

Avery!

[groaning]

Avery, are you alive?

Uh... barely.

Sorina, meet me where we first met.

Uh, yeah. Yeah. I'll be there.

- Oh, my God. Are you okay?

- No.

Wait, hey! My car!

Hey, come back here!

Stop, you crazy b*tch!

Oh, my God. I'm so fired.

She broke two of my fingers,

strapped a f*cking b*mb to my neck.

I want her dead.

No, I'm coming to you.

Our girl just broke into secured facility.

I want everyone and everything

in their places standing by.

You're crazy.

You know that, right?

Get your laptop.

I need to know what's on this.

Hurry. I'm running out of time.

Do you know how much that drone cost?

I'm so f*cked.

Holy sh*t.

That's not a blackmail list.

It's a virus. It looks like it corrupts

and encrypts all internet traffic,

locks down all the devices connected to it

and the result will be full system crash.

No e-mail, credit cards, communication,

military satellites.

It's a doomsday virus.

Is it targeted?

Yeah. One for each country.

It uses country code

top level domain targeting,

ISP and IP geotargeting

and geofencing.

So could you target a specific country

without it affecting your own?

Looks that way.

But to use that option...

Would stop the world from spinning.

Can you encrypt it for me?

The people who want this, they'll use it.

I need to be sure they can't.

I can't guarantee that.

Time's up.

- Come on.

- A programme like this, if it's launched,

there is no way to undo it.

Forget you saw this.

What the f*ck?!

My drone and my laptop?!

I need your phone.

This doesn't sound like Kali's MO.

[car engine starts]

[text notification beep]

[fast-paced dramatic music]

[Avery] Get the f*ck out of the way!

[groaning]

[discordant dramatic music]

- [speaks Russian] Are you okay?

- No. Sorry.

- [phone ringing]

- I'm sorry.

[phone continues ringing]

I'm here.

[dial tone]

I'm here.

Come on. Please, please, please.

I'm here. Please call. Please, please.

[groaning, taser clicking]

I want every agent, private contractor

and informant on the case.

- Tear this city apart and find her.

- We're working on it, sir.

SIGINT is scraping all mobile

and electronic traffic in the city,

and we're running facial recognition

profiles with CCTV.

Why don't we know

who she's working for, huh?

Pull up a list of all foreign operatives

in the country.

Her investigations for the last year

are all about Kali. Right?

Is that who she's working for?

[Jarvis]

There's nothing to suggest that, sir.

Sir, it's the director.

Sir. No, sir. We are...

That is correct, sir.

- [speaking in Croatian] Ready?

- [speaking in Croatian] Yes, sir.

I've decrypted

the Canary Black files

and pre-loaded

the requested country file.

Let's go live.

As the world becomes more connected

through technology,

so too comes our need to work together.

Our shared enemies are becoming

increasingly sophisticated

and have a deep understanding

of the blind spots of global policing.

[static noises]

[Breznov, distorted]

Ladies and gentlemen.

I'm here to ask you

a very simple question.

Do you want your country to survive?

You need to see this.

There's a potential threat.

[Breznov] We live in a world

where bullies thrive...

The weak kneel to survive.

But tonight, you are all equal

and must kneel together.

Care of the United States government,

I have in my possession Canary Black.

It's a geo-targeted computer virus

that will end internet use as you know it.

We had nothing to do with this.

[Breznov, distorted] There's a file

for each and every one of you.

Stock markets will crash.

Government institutions will freeze.

Chaos will be inevitable.

The ransom for saving your country

is 1% of your nation's GDP.

The cost of non-compliance,

however, will be far more expensive.

As an example of my determination,

please direct your attention

to the country of... Singapore.

[dramatic, eerie music]

You have each been sent an account

in which to pay the required amount.

This is non-negotiable.

You have one hour to comply.

[speaking in Croatian]

The entire world will be hunting us.

[speaking in Croatian]

Can they really pay in an hour?

[speaking in Croatian] The more time

we give them, the more exposed we are.

Prepare to steal a trillion dollars.

Pull up the Singapore satellite feeds

and country analytics.

What's going on?

They just unleashed Canary Black

on Singapore.

If someone doesn't pay, the world

stops turning or he starts World w*r III.

That's one hell of a blackmail file.

It's more than that.

We built Canary Black

as a pre-emptive first strike w*apon

to counter the increasing threat

of cyber warfare.

It's a digital nuke

in the cyber arms race.

It's the highest level of clearance.

Even the president

doesn't know about it.

We also built a US file inside it,

in case of a civil w*r,

a coup or an invasion.

There is no workaround,

you understand?

We need to find out where the hell

this broadcast is coming from.

Where's Station Chief Hedlund?

[dramatic music]

[indistinct voices]

[rats squeaking]

Her eyes, there was her eyes

Her eyes, her whole heart...

Drop your g*n... slowly.

[g*n clatters on floor]

[henchman]

We have a tourist.

Station Chief Hedlund.

This is an unpleasant surprise.

Breznov. You're behind this.

- Is he alone?

- Yes.

Where's Avery? Is she alive?

If you're alone,

that means you're helping her,

which means CIA is not aware.

- Is she alive?!

- You should know better, Hedlund.

Don't get attached

to people you can't save.

The agency will hunt you to the grave.

You've grown old, my friend.

You're stuck in the Cold w*r,

while I'm fighting a digital one.

Cold w*r. Digital w*r.

Only the assholes change.

[groans]

k*ll his phone and dump his body.

- [slap]

- [groans]

Consider me impressed, Avery Graves.

Breznov.

I have Canary Black, and now the world

will pay for your weakness.

You've made me a very rich man.

You're a bleeding-heart nationalist.

This can't just be about money.

And you are an arrogant American

with a saviour complex.

The reign of the global superpower

is over.

You all treat the rest of the world

like servants. But for no longer.

If you release those files,

millions of people will die.

Collateral casualties

in a w*r without b*ll*ts.

You're blaming the wrong person, Avery.

It is the United States who built Canary

Black to be used one day, and it pays.

No, no, it doesn't have to be.

Let me see David. We had a deal.

I consider myself a man of my word.

How did you find me?

By looking in the gutter.

My father was a patriot.

He used this space to interrogate men

sent to k*ll him.

This has always been a place

where tyrants come to die.

[door thuds]

David.

Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

[muffled groan]

No! You don't need him.

We had an agreement.

- We had an ultimatum.

- f*ck you!

Make it last.

sh*t...

You have a lot to talk about.

Your programme is taking us all

to the brink of collapse.

This is not our programme.

It's an act of sabotage

against my country.

[speaking in Spanish]

It's an extinction-level event

for our economy.

What do we do?

[phones ringing, clamour of voices]

[speaking in Russian]

They should pay for everyone's ransom.

...wants an answer.

[henchman speaking in Croatian]

South Korea paid 10.7 billion dollars.

10.4 billion dollars from Mexico.

China, too, 180 billion!

[speaking in Croatian]

I want total silence!

Mr President.

I'm working on it.

Yes, sir. In light of the danger

I have to recommend again that we pay.

It'll buy us time

to figure out who's behind this.

Mr President.

[dramatic music]

[groans]

This is for Rurik.

[groaning]

[dramatic music builds]

David Brooks doesn't know

how to do that.

[David] I'm sorry, honey.

I didn't mean for this to happen.

Who the f*ck are you?

Your husband.

Tell me the truth or I swear to God,

I'll shoot you myself.

Breznov knows about Canary Black

because I told him.

It was the only leverage I had.

My source said that

Stoica still had the file on him.

We had to make you believe that

I'd been kidnapped so you'd go and get it.

This isn't answering

any of my questions.

I botched a job for the Russian mob.

They saddled me with a $20 million debt

and snitched my identity to Breznov.

But the plan went to shite

because there was no file

and Breznov said he would k*ll you.

You're Kali.

No, then...

Jesus Christ.

So everything is a lie.

No. No. Not our marriage.

Our whole life together was totally real.

I'm sorry. I was trying to protect us.

I will deal with Breznov

and I will make this right, I promise.

f*ck you. Find a way to cut their internet

feed. I'm gonna stop Breznov.

My Treasury Department made a transfer.

Brazil and Sweden have paid as well.

Same with Italy, Egypt and Greece.

We have no choice.

[suspenseful music]

[speaking in German]

We have to transfer the money.

Otherwise, we might not have

a working country in eight minutes!

[speaking in Russian] We can't allow you

to be known as the president

that destroyed his country.

Pay it.

[speaking in Russian]

No matter what happens,

I will not let the US get away with this.

[speaking in Japanese] We must protect

our country at all costs.

[speaking in Croatian]

1.4 billion from Morocco.

Japan is in. 40 billion.

They're ghosting the system.

It could take days to find out

- where the source of the feed is.

- You got minutes.

China and Russia elevated their alert

status. The EU is doing the same.

Everyone is pointing the finger at us.

Find me Agent Graves! Where's Hedlund?

M.I.A. Phone's off.

We're pinging his cell for a location.

His cell is currently located

in the Gretsch neighbourhood.

Also, his computer logs show

he accessed the PLK building blueprints

right before it was broken into.

This entire station is compromised.

I want a full tactical team

to hit that location, now.

- Let's move.

- Should we inform Breznov?

Let's contain this ourselves.

[melancholic music]

We're at 940 billion.

The EU. The US.

They all paid.

Ready the files for China, Russia,

Germany, France, the UK

and the United States of America.

It's time to level the playing field.

[loud electrical sparks]

- What the hell is going on?

- [in Croatian] It must be overloaded.

[henchman]

Check the breaker.

[indistinct voices]

[henchman]

Come on, hurry.

[Breznov]

Make it operational. Quick.

[speaking in Croatian]

Guys, flip the breaker switches!

Has the breaker tripped?

[indistinct speech in Croatian]

[indistinct speech in Croatian]

[henchman] We need to make sure

the lines are connected.

[indistinct speech in Croatian]

[Breznov]

How long until it's operational again?

[henchman] I don't know yet.

- We need to turn on the backup batteries.

- [henchman 2] I'm on it.

[Breznov]

What's taking so long? Hurry up.

[speaking in Croatian]

How long will this take...? Hurry.

[henchman]

You go that way.

[indistinct speech in Croatian]

- [speaking in Croatian] How much longer?

- [speaking in Croatian] Ten seconds.

[grunting]

[Breznov]

Seal this room.

[Breznov speaking in Croatian]

Launch the files!

- Launch the files!

- I can't! The routers are down!

- We need to get upstairs!

- Grab the laptop, move it!

[Breznov, in English]

Somebody k*ll her!

[speaking Croatian] Go!

[henchman speaking in Croatian]

Come on!

[henchman speaking in Croatian]

Go, go, go!

I'll cover you. I'll sweep the area.

[fast-paced dramatic music]

[music builds]

[Breznov]

Come on, come on.

[Breznov speaking in Croatian]

Open the door, hurry!

[Breznov, in English]

Move, move, move.

[henchman speaking in Croatian]

Come on, come on!

[loud clatter]

[groan]

[Breznov speaking in Croatian]

Go! Go!

[indistinct speech in Croatian]

[Breznov speaking in Croatian]

Get online.

[henchman speaking in Croatian]

Help me! Breznov!

Breznov. Please.

[speaking in Croatian] Get to that

computer or I'll shoot you myself.

I don't suppose I can bribe you

with billions of dollars.

You're the only woman in this world

who would turn down that money.

You're putting up a better fight

than your husband ever did.

[groaning]

[grunts]

[computer beeps]

[Avery groans]

You f*cking b*tch.

Will you f*cking die?!

Not my f*cking time.

[squish]

[dramatic music]

[Avery grunts]

[computer beeping]

Honey...

Avery...

Are you okay?

I'll live.

So... where do we even start?

Listen, if I could go back

and undo everything I would,

except loving you and you letting me.

We can start over. On our own terms,

with no secrets, no lies.

We can fix this.

We have each other, just like always.

Do we? I'm not so sure.

I loved you, David.

Go, go, go!

What are you...? No.

- [Avery] Some things are beyond fixing.

- [David] No.

[Avery]

This is one of them.

We can get through this.

Just give me one more chance.

Avery.

We don't get a happy ever after, David.

[tactical team]

Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

Drop your weapons!

Drop your weapons!

- [Maxfield] Stay down on your knees.

- [tactical team] Drop your weapons!

- [Maxfield] Stay where you are.

- [tactical team] Don't move!

I love you.

- David!

- [Maxfield] Stay down!

- [g*nf*re]

- [Maxfield] Don't move!

- [team member 1] Hands, hands!

- [team member 2] Stay down!

[handcuffs fastening]

[thud]

[Evans]

You know what this is?

Every oath of allegiance you broke.

The estimated damages caused,

the crimes you committed.

You got your co-conspirator

mentor k*lled,

your co-conspirator husband k*lled.

You took the entire world

to the brink of w*r.

A bad luck charm for anyone

that crosses your path.

And when we dredge up

your husband's body,

he'll be buried in a landfill

like the trash he is.

You... have no country.

You have no rights.

You do not exist anymore.

I own you. And for the rest

of your miserable life,

I'm gonna make sure

you remember that. But first...

I'm gonna return the favour.

God... g*dd*mn it.

[Evans groans]

Seems you require medical attention.

That will be all, Deputy Director Evans.

Who the hell are you?

You should be receiving a call

right about now

that will explain the situation.

Do close the door on your way out.

[phone vibrating]

[Evans]

Mr President? Yes, sir.

Quite the tempest you've stirred,

Mrs Graves.

Who are you?

My friends call me Elizabeth.

I'd like to offer you a job.

You've proven your skills to be exemplary.

And I hire only the best.

I'd like you to join MC6.

I don't know what that is.

Well, that's because until tonight,

we didn't exist.

I suppose I should thank you for that.

We're tasked with handling

only the most critical missions

on the highest scale of the threat alert

beyond the capabilities

of the other agencies.

Now, I can make all of this

unpleasantness disappear.

Unless, of course, you'd like to rot

in prison for the rest of your life.

That's assuming they can contain me.

Is that a yes?

We could use you.

The world needs saving.
