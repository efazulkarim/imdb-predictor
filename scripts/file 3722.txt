What time did you get 
in last night? 
Late. 
You were snoring. 
Hmm. 
I don't snore. 
You do when you're stressed. 
He goes back to school today. 
They'll catch who did it. 
He could have been killed. 
Probably some stoned kids 
being stupid with daddy's gun. Looks good to me. 
It's tragic. 
I don't know when that happened. Oh well. 
Hey. 
Don't worry. 
I'll talk to him today. 
I wish he'd talk to me. 
He's been so quiet. 
Teenagers don't talk 
to their parents. 
They have a code of silence. 
He'll be fine. 
Last call 
for flight 306... 
Hey bud, you awake 
in there? 
Funny. 
Funny, dad. 
Hey, uh... so, is gramps 
gonna have a open casket? 
Closed casket. 
Why don't we just roast him? 
Oh, that's lovely. 
It's called cremation. 
And no, he's going to be buried next to your grandmother. 
I think that gramps would 
like to have a viking funeral. Viking? 
Yeah. 
I mean, he loved that stuff. 
Page 2/37
Like, you just, like, 
put him on his boat and... 
And light it on fire and, 
you know, 
send it out into the ocean. 
Hey, there's an idea. 
That's one way to get rid of 
your boat. 
Hey, drive him to school today? I was planning on it. 
Love you. 
Love you too. 
You working late? 
I hope not. 
You need to start thinking 
about that eulogy. 
I know, I will. 
I'm ready when you are. 
Oh, shit. 
Dad, it- it doesn't matter, 
really. 
Dad, come on. 
Alright. 
I have an idea. 
What if I kept the boat? 
Yeah, why not? 
You live in the boat and I use your bedroom as 
my second office. 
- Fine with me. 
I'm joking. 
Come on, we're gonna be late. 
You ok? 
Yeah. 
See you later. 
Hey, uh... 
Anytime you wanna talk, 
we're here for you. 
Ok, bud? 
Yeah, I know. 
Thanks. 
Thanks, dad. 
See ya later 
sir, let's see 
Page 3/37
some identification. 
Badger, tower one. 
We have confirmation target 
has left the nest. 
Roger that, tower one. 
We're ten clicks away. 
Badger, target has picked up 
the package. 
Wait a sec. 
Shit. 
Tower one, badger, 
we lost the link. 
Badger. Tower one, abort? 
Negative, tower one. 
Third time this month. 
Every time I'm back... 
Re-acquiring a link. 
It's gonna be tight. 
Tower one, badger, 
we're back up. 
Target 
traveling north towards 
the main straightaway. 
Speed, altitude, 
heading all good. 
Targeting. 
Target locked and we are 
on the straightaway. 
Tower one, badger, 
are we clear to fire? 
Badger, 
tower one, Roger that. 
You are clear to fire. 
Take the shot. 
Three, two, one. 
Rifle. 
Impact in ten seconds. 
Holding target. 
Five, four, three, two... 
Splat. 
Tower one, badger, 
partial hit on target. 
Confirming kill. 
Wait, I think- I think 
Page 4/37
i see movement. 
Wow, would you look at that. 
That's one tough dune coon. 
Tower one, badger, 
kill is not confirmed. 
Repeat, kill is not confirmed. Permission to fire 
second hellfire. Over. 
Affirmative, badger. 
10-4. 
Still locked. 
Three, two, one. 
Rifle. 
Are you gonna be allowed out 
of the house this weekend? 
I'm busy with the funeral. 
Oh, Christ. 
I'm sorry, I forgot. 
It's ok. 
Have you ever written 
a eulogy? 
Yeah, actually I have. 
For my uncle stu's funeral. 
It did not go well. 
Why, what happened? 
I don't- just- ok. 
He was kind of a miserable guy and, you know, he took it out 
on his wife and his kids 
and everybody, 
including me, so I said fuck it, I just got up there 
and told it like it was. 
It was fucking hilarious. 
So... 
Were you born an asshole, 
Gary? 
Quite possibly, yeah. 
Look, you're gonna be fine. 
Your dad was a stand up guy. 
Yeah, but how do you condense 
a man's entire life 
into five minutes? Huh? 
There's probably an app 
Page 5/37
for that, right? 
You, like, download a template, put in his name 
and then boom, it writes it 
for you? 
Might even give the speech 
for you, huh? 
Great, thanks. 
I don't know, ask Ellen. 
Women are good at 
this kind of shit. 
She's doing too much already. 
Well, don't ask a guy. 
You know? 
We- we bury that shit for, 
like, 20 years 
and then deal with it 
in therapy later. 
- Guess what. 
- What? 
Hey. 
We're opening a new office, 
right on Campbell street. 
Really? 
Yeah, right next to the college. Think about how good our 
lunch dates would be then. 
Yeah, I think our... 
Our lunch dates are working 
pretty good right now. 
I've been thinking. 
What? 
How about a weekend away? 
It can be a work thing. Right? Like a conference or a workshop. Whatever you want. 
I don't know. 
What do you mean, 
you don't know? 
I don't know. 
Either we have something 
or we don't. 
Of course we do, Ted, 
but a weekend away 
Page 6/37
is a whole... 
Wake up next to me, Ellen. 
Spend an entire day with me. 
I thought we agreed no pressure. Right? 
I mean... that was sort 
of the deal. 
Yeah, that was the deal. 
That was also three months ago. Ted... 
Ted. 
Ted! 
Hey, Ted! 
You were very clear. 
Come on, please. 
Ted, come on. 
Please, don't be mad. 
Promise me you'll think 
about it. 
I'll think about it. 
I promise. 
State department 
spokesperson Daniel winters 
said this in last night's 
emergency press conference: 
"Due to the latest release 
of hacked NSA cables, 
substantial damage 
has been done. 
We believe that these government personnel have been put 
at potential risk 
because their names have 
been compromised 
in this release. 
We will find those responsible and they will be dealt 
with accordingly." 
In international news, 
the us launched air strikes 
against an Isis stronghold... 
Oh, oh... 
Woah! 
Don't hit the slide, guys. 
Page 7/37
Oh, here we go. 
Remember my rule, 
no hitting the bench. 
Let's go! 
Ok. 
I got it, I got it. 
There you go. 
Alright yeah 
throw strong. 
Come on, son. 
Yeah, alright. 
Let's do this. 
I haven't seen you around 
here before. 
I'm... I'm visiting. 
Visiting, huh? 
Yes. 
So, you waiting for someone, 
or...? 
Yes. 
You're meeting them here? 
No, I'm just enjoying 
the sunshine. 
It's a lovely day. 
Hey, come on, 
remember what I said? 
Catch it with your hand. 
Geez. I tell ya. 
It's a park for kids, mister. 
I like it here. 
I like to watch 
the children playing 
with their mothers and fathers. Right. 
News flash, buddy. 
In this country 
we don't like strangers 
watching our kids. 
Especially strangers like you. So why don't you get lost? 
Why don't you go to a mosque and read that little book of yours? I meant no offense. 
Well, I'm offended. Ok? 
Page 8/37
So beat it. 
Sorry if I ruined your day. 
Any time now. 
"Confirm visual, I repeat, 
confirm visual. 
Hey. 
You ok? 
Yeah. 
I thought you were gonna 
be here earlier. 
Yeah, traffic was a bitch. 
You uh... can have 
the dresser. 
Catch. 
How's the eulogy coming? 
Harder than I thought. 
You want me to write it? 
No. 
No, I said I would and I will. He dropped bombs on Hitler. 
Yet he died barely able 
to hold a crayon. 
I'm not ending up in 
a place like this. 
There's no guarantees in life, big brother. 
Hey, if I end up talking 
to the walls, you shoot me. 
I mean it. 
Hey, did you see this? 
Charlie gave it to me. 
He was saying how Shane would 
visit a couple times a week. 
You raised a good kid. 
Huh. 
I'm surprised he found the time. You didn't know he visited pops? Sure, I knew. 
I just didn't think he visited that often. 
You sure didn't. 
Hey. 
Neither did you. 
Yeah. 
Page 9/37
Well, I guess we both dropped 
the ball there. 
Listen, I know we don't talk 
a lot, 
but I just want you to know that I'm here for you. 
And I'm here for you. 
That's what dad 
would have wanted. 
Come on, give your 
little brother a hug. 
Come on. 
Come here. 
What are we gonna do 
with all this stuff? 
I'll take care of it. 
You sure? 
Yeah, I'm sure. 
Yeah. 
- Hey. 
Yeah? 
Hey, dad. 
How was school? 
It was ok. 
Any updates? 
Nope. 
What game are you playing? 
Um, bullet catcher iv. 
I uh, I saw your uncle today 
dad, uh, do you mind? 
I'm online here 
with a couple players. 
Sure. 
What? 
I... nothing. 
Shit. 
Can I help you? 
I said, can I help you? 
I was, uh, I was passing by 
and I saw the sign. 
Oh yeah? 
I'm sorry, I didn't mean 
to intrude. 
Are you really interested? 
Page 10/37
Yes. 
I am interested. 
I... I put an ad online, 
must have been a month ago. 
To be honest, I forgot the sign was still there. 
Yes, I uh, I read 
the ad actually. 
Great. 
Want a closer look? 
Please. 
"Amazing... 
Grace. 
Grace. 
Grace. 
"Amazing grace". 
Are you a sailor that keeps 
the name of the boat? 
Amazing grace is a perfect name. If I buy this I will 
re-paint it. 
May I ask why you're selling it? When my father couldn't 
manage it on his own anymore 
he gave it to me. 
He's a generous man. 
He was. 
He passed away recently. 
The cabin is in good shape. 
There's beautiful mahogany 
wood down below. 
She's much faster 
than you would expect. 
So uh, one day you just decided to jump into the deep end? 
The deep end? 
Yeah, looking at buying a boat like this, you know? 
Out of- out of the blue? 
It was a boat from the blue, 
yes. 
Well, uh, just so you know 
I'm asking 16- 
16,000 
Page 11/37
$16,000? 
Yes, $16,000. 
Are you firm on that price? 
What do you have in mind? 
Perhaps we can sit down 
and discuss a price 
that works for both of us? 
Yeah, why not? 
I'm Neil wiston, by the way. 
Imir. 
Shah. 
Beth, Ted's been calling 
every 20 minutes, I don't 
know what to do. 
A weekend away? 
We're talking serious risk. 
Right. 
I know, but I think I'll lose 
him if I don't go. 
And that doesn't set off 
warning bells? 
Ok, I got it. 
You don't think I should go. 
Honey, listen to me. 
Right now you and Ted 
have a thing. 
If you go away with him, 
it's not a thing anymore. 
It's a different thing. 
Don't go down that road 
unless you're absolutely sure. Are you there? 
Yeah. 
Ellen, are you ok? 
Hey! 
Hey! 
Come here! 
Get back here! 
You get back here! 
You little fuckers! 
Nooo! 
Hey! 
Oh my god. 
Beer? 
Page 12/37

Thank you. 
I wasn't sure if uh, alcohol 
was allowed. 
Haram. 
Haram, right. 
And it's been a long time 
since I was in a mosque. 
Oh, so you're not a 
you're not a practicing 
uh, not a practicing one, no. 
Ah. 
This must be your son. 
That's him. That's Shane. 
How old? 
16. Smart kid. 
Takes after his dad. 
May I ask what you do 
for a living? 
I'm in it. 
Um, computers. 
Jesus Christ, my laptop! 
Shit. 
I hope this wasn't my doing. 
No, no. 
I'm uh, trying to write 
my father's eulogy. 
It's driving me crazy. 
Were you and your father close? Yeah, I like to think so. 
I need a good opening. 
Once I get that, then 
the rest will follow. 
Maybe you should start 
with a childhood memory. 
Speak to who 
your father was, 
not what he accomplished 
in his life. 
Oh, I got plenty of 
sailing stories. 
My brother Dave and I spent 
every weekend on the boat 
when we were kids. 
There. You've got your opening. Page 13/37

May I make another suggestion? Sure. 
In my humble opinion, 
allow the story of your father to have true meaning. 
True meaning? 
I was taught the dead live on 
in three ways. 
Through their good deeds, 
through the charity other 
people give in their name 
and, most important, 
through the knowledge they 
leave behind in this world 
that benefits others. 
Wow, that's beautiful. 
Thank you. 
I hope I was helpful. 
Yeah, you were. 
My wife, I uh, I gotta give her a hand. 
Do you mind? 
Of course. 
What happened? 
Baseball. 
Kids. 
Jesus. 
- I know. 
You ok? 
Yeah, I'm fine. 
You should have called me. 
I'm fine, really. 
Hey. 
Hello. 
I'm imir shah. 
Um, you must be Shane. 
Yeah. 
Um... my dad around, or...? 
Yes, um, he's outside. 
Greeting your mother. 
I'm here to talk about 
buying the boat. 
That was my granddad's boat. 
I know. 
Page 14/37
You sure you wanna buy it? 
You don't think I should? 
Well, I don't know, I mean, 
it's just an old boat. 
Hope it doesn't have termites. Hello. 
Hi. 
Ellen, Mr. shah. 
Mr. shah, I hear you're 
interested in the boat. 
I am. Please, call me imir. 
It's nice to meet you, imir. 
-Pleasure. 
I'm just gonna put these down 
and grab a drink. 
Would you like something? 
-No, thank you. 
He already has a beer. 
I also have real masala 
chai tea, if you'd rather. 
That sounds lovely, 
thank you, Ellen. 
Great. Sure. 
Do you need a hand? 
No, I'm fine. Thank you. 
You really do have 
a beautiful home. 
Thank you. 
Yeah, we're uh, 
we're working on it. 
You're coming home from work, 
is that right? 
Yeah. 
She teaches at the uh, 
community college. 
What do you teach? 
I teach, um, comparative 
cultures. 
You're an anthropology teacher. Ethnology, actually. 
You must have read Levi Strauss. You know his work? 
I was under the impression 
his ideas were central 
Page 15/37
to ethnological methodology. 
Well, in structuralism, yeah. 
A bit out of fashion these days. Why, are you an 
anthropologist? 
Unfortunately, no. 
I'm a computer engineer. 
My father threatened 
to pull me out of Oxford 
if I switched disciplines. 
Oxford? 
God, I'd love to study 
at Oxford. 
It's not nearly as glamorous 
as the brochures and films 
make it seem. 
We should probably get back 
to the business at hand. 
Um, I'll take it. 
That boat. 
I accept your price. 
Are you serious? 
Yes. 
What was the price? 
Sixteen. 
Great. Great. 
I uh, don't want to change 
your mind, 
but I thought we were 
gonna negotiate. 
Well, you seem like 
honest people. 
I'm sure what you're asking 
is a fair market price. 
Thank you. 
That's nice. 
That's nice, yeah. 
Cheers. 
Cheers. 
Thank you. 
I hope you enjoy it. 
This tea would not be 
out of place 
at a cafe in Karachi, Ellen. 
Page 16/37
It tastes like home. 
That's sweet of you. 
I'm glad you're enjoying it. 
Imir's been helping me write 
dad's eulogy. 
Really? 
I'm surprised he mentioned it 
to you. 
Hey, I was surprised, too. 
What can I say? 
Imir enlightened me. 
What was it you said? 
Start with a childhood memory? Something that speaks 
to who dad was, 
not what he accomplished 
in life. 
There's my opening. 
A sailing story. 
But it's gonna have 
a life lesson. 
Something dad taught me. 
Ok. I got an idea. 
Why don't you stay for supper? Honey, I'm sure 
we can talk some more. 
-No. 
I'm sure he's got other plans. As it happens, I don't. 
I would love to share a meal 
with you. 
Great. Great. 
Yeah. 
We'll celebrate 
the sale of the boat. 
I'll fire up the Barbie. 
What do you want? Steak? 
Um, actually I don't eat meat. What else do we have? 
Salmon? Do you like salmon? 
I do, yes. Thank you. 
Ellen? 
-I'll have salmon, too. 
And if you're doing a steak, 
Page 17/37
do one for Shane. 
Surf and turf it is. 
Pearly whites. 
A lot of money in braces. 
Hey, mom. 
Oh, hey honey. This is Mr. shah. He's buying our boat. 
Yeah, yeah. 
We met earlier. 
Hey, what time's dinner? 
It'll be ready in about 
a half hour. 
Cool. I'm just gonna go out 
for a bit, so... 
Ok. 
That's Shane. 
He doesn't seem very happy, 
does he? 
Oh, I don't know. 
I think 
he has a face my teenaged 
daughter would sometimes make. Right, well... 
Teenagers, right? 
I mean, his grandfather 
just died, 
so that's probably part of it. Oh, of course. I'm sorry. 
No, it's... 
Do you mind if I use 
the loo to wash my hands? 
Oh, god, yeah sure, but the 
one down here doesn't work, 
of course. You'll have to go 
upstairs. 
It's just down the hall. 
Thank you. 
What's this? 
David gave it to me. 
Did you know Shane was visiting dad twice a week? 
No. 
He didn't say anything. 
I'll see you in Valhalla, 
Page 18/37
gramps! 
Where's Shane? 
I don't know. 
He said he wanted to go out 
for a little bit. 
I'm gonna put a tracking device on that kid. 
Can't you track him 
with GPS? 
I hear a lot of American parents are doing this. 
Yeah, I was actually joking. 
But yeah, I do know 
some parents 
have this new tracking app. 
Paranoid parents, 
which we're not. 
Don't give him any ideas, 
please. 
So where... where exactly 
are you from, imir? 
Karachi. 
Mmm. The city of lights. 
How long have you been 
in the states? 
I just arrived. 
I'm starting a new contract. 
Oh yeah? What do you do? 
Systems integration. 
I'm a programmer. 
Listen, I uh, I don't wanna 
change the subject, 
but maybe we could discuss how you plan to pay for the boat. 
I- I can... arrange a bank 
transfer tomorrow 
if that's alright. 
I don't see why not. 
Yeah. Perfect. 
Hey, bud. Glad you could 
make it. 
Sorry, dad. 
Hey, actually is it ok if I just eat in my room? 
Page 19/37
No, that's rude. Sit down. 
Neil. 
Growing boys eat like 
their limbs are empty, hmm? 
What's the American term 
for it? Chow down? 
Yeah. 
It's a... military expression. Hmm. 
For eating. 
It's work. 
Excuse me. 
Yeah? 
Bad timing? 
My steak's getting cold. 
What do you want? 
Play nice. 
I'm doing you a favour, here. 
Security briefing at 07:00 
tomorrow, ok? 
Attendance is mandatory. 
Security? 
Why? What's up? 
It's the leak. 
Head office is flipping the fuck out over the gun sight videos. Some Geneva convention bullshit about non-military 
combat missions. 
How does that affect 
the program? 
Because if the press finds out we're contractors 
they're gonna shut us down. 
It wouldn't be the worst thing in the world. 
Just... I'll see you tomorrow, ok? 
Yeah. 
Sorry about that. 
Was that Gary? 
Yeah. 
What'd he want? 
One of the servers is down 
Page 20/37
so I'm in early tomorrow. 
What a shock. 
Honestly, if we made time 
and a half for all the hours 
he works overtime 
we'd be rich. 
It's 9-5 one day, it's graveyard shift the next. 
It's completely crazy. 
Can I be excused now? 
You may. 
How about I get us some dessert? Some cheesecake, huh? 
I've never had American 
cheesecake. 
I hear it doesn't even taste 
like cheese. 
Hey, Shane. 
Go help your mom 
with the dishes. 
Are we saving this for anything? We're gonna toast the sale 
of the boat. 
Perhaps we should include 
your grandfather in the toast. Yeah, I like that idea. 
You have a big heart, imir. 
If it wasn't for dad, 
we wouldn't be standing here, 
would we? 
I suppose not. 
Pop grove. 2012. 
That was a good year. 
First and last time I won 
my fantasy six football pool. 
In 2012 I had been working 
abroad for two years. 
I hadn't seen my family 
in all that time. 
That's tough. 
It was. 
We would video chat 
but it wasn't the same. 
I missed this. Family meals. 
Page 21/37
Nine hacks of classified files, four attacks on NSA firewalls. We should have picked him up 
at the Seattle airport. 
It's not my call. 
Rover, this is canary. 
We have a match 
in your vicinity. 
Hey, stop here. 
The house belongs to 
a private contractor. 
He works for us. 
Are you kidding me? 
A toast to new friends. 
To fair weather sailing 
on the water and off. 
Fair weather sailing? 
Hey, don't interrupt. 
I'm just getting started. 
He is not famous for his toasts. -Yeah, no kidding. 
Watch out. 
To everyone's health. 
Including financially. 
And lastly, to my father. 
For as long as I can remember 
he loved the sea. 
And he loved that boat. 
Imir, we're passing on a piece of wiston family history to you, and I know we've only just met but I think my dad 
would approve. 
Because you're a good man. 
Thank you. I am honoured. 
Cheers. 
Cheers. 
Cheers, everyone. 
Cheers. 
Why don't you give me 
your plate. 
So imir, it must be so hard 
to be away from home, huh? 
When do you get to see 
Page 22/37
your family again? 
Soon. 
The last time I shared 
a family meal, 
my daughter was about your age. Nazarene. 
She was having some trouble 
in school. 
See, before we moved to Karachi she had never been 
in a co-ed school. 
She had never been 
around boys her own age. 
And the other girls knew this, and they would tease 
her and shame her. 
-My god. 
I tried to talk to her 
but nothing I said made 
any difference. 
I felt like I was helpless. 
Like I had failed as a father. I think- I think all parents 
feel that from time to time. 
Yeah. Perhaps. 
A few days later they went 
to miranshah 
to visit with some relatives. 
I couldn't go, I had to stay 
in the city for work. 
Miranshah is in waziristan, 
right? 
On the Afghan border 
where the Taliban are? 
Among other things. 
But yes, the Pakistani Taliban. Hmm. 
So there's two different types of Taliban? 
It's complicated. 
It is complicated, isn't it? 
Yeah. Yeah, it is. 
We want the world to be 
black and white. 
Page 23/37
Good guys, bad guys. 
So often in the real world 
that's not the case. 
You see, uh, waziristan 
is a tribal area. 
Very conservative, 
very religious. 
They treat their women 
like cattle. 
I'm sorry, have you been there? Can't say that I have, no. 
But I was in New York 
a week after 9/11. 
Seemed pretty 
black and white to me. 
Dad, can I have another 
glass of wine please? 
Sure. 
-I don't think it's a good idea. No, it's a celebration, Ellen. Come on. 
My wife is very well-respected in my family and my community 
and we built a very happy 
life together. 
Yeah, of course. 
Of course. 
What's her name? 
Fatima. 
It's beautiful. 
She was. 
There's no beauty in death. 
I'm so sorry. 
Wherever she is, 
she's with nazarene. 
They died together. 
Oh my god. 
What happened? 
It's uh- I don't think 
we should 
no, it's alright. 
Um, they were struck 
by a missile. 
That's... awful. 
Page 24/37
It was awful. 
So, I mean... who fired 
who fired the missile? 
A drone aircraft 
belonging to the CIA. 
That's horrible. 
Were they just... 
Just in the wrong place 
at the wrong time? 
Yeah, must have been. 
They weren't the only ones. 
I ask you, what is 
the right place? 
The men they are attempting 
to kill 
are constantly surrounded 
by civilians. 
So, I mean, did the CIA, 
did they think that 
the civilians were Isis? 
I don't care what 
they thought. 
Only what they did. 
Well, whatever... 
Whatever it was 
they were trying to do, 
the- the us government does 
not fire indiscriminately. 
Well, perhaps the CIA 
has a different definition 
of "indiscriminate". 
Well, yeah, 
I mean... mistakes happen. 
But i- I think it's easy to um, you know, 
take things out of context. 
I mean, sometimes we don't know the bigger picture. 
Perhaps the bigger picture 
is that, 
in the border regions, 
civilians have been living under the threat of these bomb strikes for a decade. 
Page 25/37
Children are afraid to go 
to school. 
Public gatherings of any kind 
are avoided, 
all because America thinks 
it's above the law. 
I- I don't understand. 
Why is the us firing missiles 
into civilian territory? 
I mean, that doesn't seem 
very good question, Shane. 
Maybe Neil has the answer. 
No, you know 
listen- hey, everyone, 
i don't think we should 
let's just not get into 
this right now, please. 
No, hey, it's just discussion. Ok, but I think it's enough. I think it's enough. 
Look. I can't- I can't even 
imagine how you feel, 
and we are all so sorry 
for your loss. 
Yeah. 
We are. Of course. 
Of course we are. 
Thank you, Ellen. 
And I'm sorry, this is 
it's not a topic of conversation for your dinner table. 
I've been wholly inappropriate. Today's just not a good day 
for me. 
It's the anniversary 
of their deaths. 
Ellen, why- why don't you go 
make some coffee? 
Yeah. Ok. 
Would you like some 
more tea? 
Um, actually coffee 
sounds good. 
Ok. Give me a hand? 
Page 26/37
Yeah. 
Oh my god. 
That was... are you ok? 
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. 
He's obviously distraught 
and dad's obviously had 
too much to drink. 
It's a bad combo. 
Mom, I mean really, we're just talking, it's not a big deal. 
No, you know what? 
We're done talking. 
Ok? We're gonna serve this 
coffee and call it a night. 
Now get me the cream. 
Fine. 
So what happened 
to the CIA guy? 
Happened? 
Nothing ever happens 
to them. 
He simply continued on 
with their work. 
I gotta take this. 
So, the military, 
they just allow that? 
Talk to me. 
Alright, I checked the logs. 
We flew a sortie into miranshah. One year ago today. 
What was the target? 
Some al-quaeda bomb-maker 
in the middle of town. 
Hellfire strike outside 
his house, right? 
You see, Shane, some drone 
pilots aren't even soldiers. 
They don't come within 1,000 
kilometers of the battlefield. They work in their 
secure cubicles, 
essentially playing 
a video game. 
The only difference 
Page 27/37
is in this video game 
the victims are real. 
Do you remember 
any collateral damage? 
Possibly, but we didn't have 
boots on the ground 
so if there was a body count 
we couldn't verify it. 
They come home to their families after a long day of murder 
and put their children to bed. It's so easy to divorce 
what they do 
from real life consequences. 
I didn't know that. 
Some coffee? 
Thank you. 
Cream and sugar? 
No, it's fine like this. 
Ok. 
Could this information 
have come out in the leak? 
Wait, is that what 
you're worried about? 
Ellen finding out? 
No, not her. 
Ok, then who? 
Just answer the question, 
will ya? 
I don't know, maybe, 
but it's a stretch. 
Why? What- what's this about? 
Nothing. 
I'll call you in the morning. 
Listen, we should probably 
go over the spec on the boat 
and the registration. 
Can I see you in my office 
for a minute? 
I don't know what kind of game you think you're playing 
but I want you out of 
my house right now! 
Will you threaten with 
Page 28/37
physical violence if I refuse? Trust me, you do not want 
to go there. 
I must admit, you're not 
what I expected, Neil wiston. 
I'm calling the police. 
You won't do that. 
Oh yeah? Why not? 
Because of what I've got 
in my briefcase 
sitting in your kitchen. 
And this detonator. 
Do you know how much 
high explosive 
is in a hellfire missile, Neil? Almost 20 pounds. 
I googled it. 
Ah, damnit. 
Canary? 
Oh, shit. 
It's rover. 
Code red. I repeat: Code red. 
Target has a possible 
explosive device. 
In a few minutes it'll be 
exactly one year 
from the moment of 
my family's death. 
What do you want? 
In time. 
Give me your phone. 
Give it. 
Look. 
Look, your family is dead. 
I know, and I'm sorry. 
I really am. 
But I don't know what the hell you think that has to do with you know exactly 
what this has to do with you. 
I told you! 
I write code for a living! 
Stop lying! 
Your government data breach, 
Page 29/37

Neil. 
It opened up a back door 
to your drone program. 
To your flight logs 
and ultimately to where 
we're standing right now. 
So from now on you will tell 
the truth to me and to them. 
Yeah, ok. 
[Phone buzzes) 
Mom? 
Mom? You gonna get that? 
Oh, good. 
Everything all settled then? 
Do they ever show you pictures of the innocents you kill, Neil? I've got your things. 
Are you a dutiful wife, Ellen? Sorry? What? 
Do you respect your husband? 
My relationship with my husband is none of your business. 
Now is the time to be honest. 
Is there something you want 
to tell your husband? 
Please 
Neil. 
Your wife is seeing another man. What- why are you saying this? Because it's the truth. 
Mom? 
Neil... why are you doing this? Why are you doing this? 
Please... 
What is this, you sick fuck! 
I learned this from you. 
I put you under 
the same surveillance 
you put my country under 
with your satellites 
and your drones. 
So normalize. 
Or shall I tell your wife 
and your son who you really are? Page 30/37

Neil? 
I don't work for lyker surveys what are you talking about? 
Actually, there is 
no lyker surveys. 
Not really, uh... 
What do you mean? 
It's just a cover. 
A cover? 
Are- are you an undercover cop? No. 
A criminal? What? 
No, I'm not a criminal. 
That's a matter of opinion. 
I uh... I'm a- I'm a contractor for the CIA. 
The CIA? 
Yeah. 
As in the central intelligence agency? 
Look, I couldn't tell you 
the truth 
because what I do is classified. I'm your fucking wife! 
Then we're all lying! 
Tell me the truth! 
Dad! 
Dad, what do you do? 
I told you, I fly uav's. Drones. I'm- what would be classified 
about aerial mapping? 
Please tell me it's just maps. I've been part of a test program for contracted covert missions. Oh my god. 
The us air force uses uav's 
to target enemy movements. 
Just like the military. 
We do everything we can to 
minimize collateral damage. 
No. No! 
You do not get to reduce it 
to collateral damage! 
They are people! With names! 
Page 31/37
Nazarene. Fatima. 
They have names. 
Ok, be careful. 
Careful. 
Ok Shane, let's go. 
Neil. 
Ellen. Ellen! 
No! 
Come here! 
Sit down! 
No! 
Sit down! 
We do what he says, ok? 
We do what he says. 
Is that a bomb? 
Is it? 
I'm so sorry that 
you're involved in this. 
Hey, Shane! 
Come here! 
Sit down! 
Sit down! 
Go. Answer it. 
You get the door. 
Go. 
Shh. 
It's going to be ok. 
What's up with all the shouting? Oh, parent-kid stuff. 
Shane's being a pain in the ass. What're you doing here? 
Well, you hung up on me 
so we were never able to finish our conversation. 
Oh. Listen, I uh... 
I'm sorry about that. 
It's just not a good time, Gary. I'm sorry. Ok? 
Oh, right. 
Well, I'm just trying to figure out what was so important 
about that particular mission. Forget about it. 
Forget about it? 
Page 32/37
Ok. Ok. 
Uh... how- how long we been 
partners, now? 
I don't know. Three years? 
Yeah. Three years. 
And I know when you're spooked. And you're spooked, ok? 
Look, when you called 
about the security briefing 
and the leak, i- I got 
to thinking, 
I just got a little freaked out but it's all good now. 
You got a little freaked out? 
Yeah. 
Gary, I swear, you're reading 
way too much into this. 
Am I? 
-Yes, you are. 
Am I? 
-Yes. 
Ok. 
Who's that? 
Oh, our neighbour. 
He saw Shane bust up Ellen's 
windshield with a baseball. 
Yeah, I saw that. 
Yeah, Shane was lying 
about it, so... 
Acting like a little shit, huh? Yeah, dumb shit. 
Ok. 
You're ok then, huh? 
Yeah. 
Ok. 
Ok. 
Alright. Well, why don't we have a little pow wow 
before the meeting 
in the morning. 
Tomorrow. 
Yeah, ok. 
Oh, and uh, tell Shane 
to fly straight 
Page 33/37
or I'm gonna kick his ass. 
You hear that, Shane? 
Yeah, he heard it. 
Alright. 
Yeah, you got it. 
Have a good night. 
You are a painfully good liar, Neil. 
Are there any other secrets 
we should discuss? 
Dad, there's something that 
i need to tell you. 
Shane, you don't have 
to do this! 
You tell him nothing! 
Don't tell him anything! 
I was there, dad. 
When granddad died. 
He squeezed my hand and he 
hadn't done that in months. 
And then he looked at me 
and he knew me. 
And then... he stopped. 
He stopped breathing. 
I could have gotten a nurse. 
I didn't feel like that was 
what he wanted so I just 
I left him there for them 
to find him. 
I guess I didn't tell you 
because I didn't want you 
to feel guilty for not being 
there. 
You should have been there, 
dad. 
You should have been there. 
That's a very good confession, Shane. 
But the guilty should 
never be spared. 
Visual ID confirmed. 
Have you ever felt real guilt, Neil? 
When you look at those 
Page 34/37
people below 
and you take their lives, 
do you feel anything? 
What do you want? Huh? 
Do you want a confession? 
Fine. 
Me and the guy who just left, 
we killed your family. 
Satisfied? 
Not at all. 
Come on. You want revenge, 
don't you? 
You want revenge. 
Come on, give me your best 
fucking shot. 
Take it out on me! 
But let them leave. 
Who said anything 
about revenge? 
Well, why else would 
you be here? 
Haven't you listened to anything I've said? 
I'm listening. I'm listening. 
Please tell us 
how we can help you. 
Tell us. 
I've lost everything. 
I'll never see my family again. There's nothing left 
for me here. 
You're upset, you're not 
thinking clearly. 
This- no, you don't want this. Please. 
I am thinking clearly. 
Please. 
Please, please, please. 
I'm thinking of how they were 
taken from me. 
I'll do anything you want. 
But please let them leave. 
I miss them so much. 
I miss them so much. 
Page 35/37
Look. 
Please, imir, let them go. 
Just- just let them leave. 
I'll do anything you want, 
please. 
Just let them leave. 
Just let them go. 
I'm sorry. 
Now's the time, Neil. 
No! 
No target. 
Shane! 
No visual on detonator. 
Hold positions. 
Hey! 
Get off me! 
Now you... understand, Neil. 
No. 
You're not gonna die! 
No! 
No! 
In the wake of 
the recent NSA data breach, 
private drone contractor 
Neil wiston has come forward 
with more information 
on the CIA test program 
that blurs the line between 
contractors and the military. 
Ironically, as a private 
contractor, 
Mr. wiston may be 
held responsible 
for any civilian casualties 
during these previously 
autonomous combat missions. 
Some folks may call wiston 
a patriot 
but I have no doubt he is 
a traitor to this country 
and will be charged 
with these crimes. 
Serious damage has been done to programs of national security. 
Page 36/37
This is the danger of 
whistleblowers like Neil wiston. They make our nation 
vulnerable.
