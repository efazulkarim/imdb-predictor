Listen, last night ...

I reacted exaggeratedly.

It's okay, it hurt to kiss me

Without brushing my teeth.

That is all.

My father came and went a lot.

What does that tell you?

That we have different

Experiences, that's all.

Y?

Nothing. Ok to share

Different experiences.

What about your mother?

He had an adventure.

Then another.

Perhaps my father

Traveled too.

After my father died,

My mother wrote to me.

He said he missed it.

I do not think so

Had called in years.

He told me...

That if I wanted a

Already...

To give you this back.

You do not want to know

That I wrote in the letter?

Do not.

Very good.

Make...

Whatever is in the letter.

Whatever.

I can not.

I can not, it's not ...

... something I can do.

I'm leaving then.

- What were you about to say?

- You can not say.

And what is in the

Letter can not be made.

Wren, I do not know if it's okay.

Say what I said in the letter.

So I do not know if I have

The permission to do so.

I noticed a time ago

How really was the truth.

What was the truth?

You never loved me.

Yes I loved you, Wren.

- Yes I love you!

- Ten years.

You show up after

Ten years, waiting for what?

I love you.

You love Me? Neither

You even know me!

Now I'm different!

That is what happens!

- Do not give a f***ing step anymore!

- What? What?

What will you do?

Are you going to close yourself?

Sure that was me

Who forced you to close yourself?

Wow!

Is that what you learned to do?

Is that what you thought to do?

Are you strong enough to

Erase our failure?

It is not choosing someone.

It is to love it.

To love him.

What?

- I'm not here alone.

Someone else wants to see you.

OMG!

I did not know that yet

You were in the country

Hi.

What are you doing here?

Is Miguel with you?

You're good?

No I'm not. I already

I knew, I had better stay.

- I'm still here.

- I see, I see.

They're together, right?

That's what I heard.

Thank you for letting me

With Miguel are women.

- That is how...?

- You get over it, right?

I knew it, what I say is ...

I do not...

I did not realize.

I just thought you'd be the

Last person who ...

You would fall

Sh*t.

I hate myself.

It is what always happens.

You were perfect at

Yours, Miguel.

And your position is very clear:

"This is how I am,

take it or leave it."

I can only end up hating myself

Myself for accepting that.

Because I loved you so much.

- Do you want me to leave?

- Do not.

That both should be examined.

Or we could go to bed,

That way we would be safe.

I want you to have it.

No, I do not.

I just do not want

To be alone with this.

It could be romantic.

I do not like

House music.

I know, I know.

What do you think, Wren?

I think that

I miss my dad.

I never told her that I loved her.

Never.

Amazing.

He did not even have that.

You told me that

Everything was sacred.

All.

That's what you said.

I remember now.

Beatrice!

Let me know about the

Results as soon as possible.

What are you thinking?

Wren?

Are you going to throw everything

Overboard?

Completely?

That is my girl.

That is my girl.

Girls, girls ...

I'm sleeping!

Our analyzes both

They came out negative.

And Ellen went to Paris.

It is being treated.

For what you count, you

I told Ellen that I loved her.

But...

Never...

I mentioned that I loved her

To her as I love you

To you.

I know i do not like you

Much at this time,

And I understand it, but

Maybe we could

Leave the camp one day

And drive somewhere.

Let's go for a walk!

Let's go for a walk!

Let's go for a walk!

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ...

Six.

We have enough blood only

For one of the patients.

Night will survive

only one. Agree?

All right...

Do you want to choose?

It's hard.

It's hard.

I'll decide, if you want.

Because if we share it,

Nobody will survive.

All right? One, Wren. One.

We should not even

To be here to begin with.

If you move, we abandon them

At the worst time.

No, we do not abandon anyone,

We use our game to attract

The attention on what happens here.

- We'll use the press.

- All right.

Will they stop the oil

In the Middle East

To come running

To West Africa?

Come on, Wren.

This...

This feels so useless.

Listen out.

We stay here

We're leaving,

Not because we think

We'll save the world, okay?

So when you talk about evacuating,

Do me a favor and say it's because of fear.

Yes? Or why

You want to bathe

Or why do you want

They bathe

Nothing happens.

Even if you manage to attract attention,

What happens next? What's up?

I never saw the oppressed become

In oppressors. Not one time.

Then why simply

We do not abandon everything.

- What?

- Let's leave everything.

Let's pack everything and let's go.

What are we doing here?

No, let's save this man,

That girl, this baby here, now.

Save them for what?

For what kind of world?

Yours.

Is that your solution?

Wren, there is no solution.

We do not have a solution.

For this? No, there is not.

Maybe I'm wrong and

Evolution is the solution.

But do you have the

Patience for that?

Do they need to evolve?

- You're a racist now?

- No no no! Hey hey!

I am not talking about them, but about the

Unconscious riches out there.

Do you think I do not know that?

- The Americans, the Europeans ...

- Yeah.

The rich.

Most people from

Here he is satisfied with little.

They leave their homes, their

Countries, to flee the war.

- They live their solution.

Is that living?

They must live,

That is the solution.

- Live?

- Yes, live.

Live?

They watch the ants climb.

And they dance, flirt,

They laugh with babies.

Yes, live.

How can they do it, because

It's the life that touched them, Wren.

Very brave, Miguel. That absolves you

To see beyond today.

The West can

Stop this

If it is implied

the best way.

I do not say that personally

I'm going to save the world.

I say I want to do everything

The possible to stop this.

Instead of playing to be God for a

Handful of lucky few.

Do you really think that

I need something for me

You do not know sh*t.

Be within me

Does not make me

You know, of course.

And i do not need

That they be like me,

If that was what you

You were talking about the bathroom.

I lived in Africa, I know

What they face,

And I'm not one of those who

He folds his arms and says,

"Damn it, there is no hope,"

Just to keep you company.

- You do not want to try?

- OMG.

Do not you want to keep me company,

At least a little

I need my

Carpet of prayer.

Forgive me.

You're here with us.

Thank you.

But you know you can

Go whenever you want

It is not until

you can not go away...

That you realize.

I really thought

That boy was going

To kill you today

I have to go and play

God, transfuse a patient.

Do not.

I will do it.

Wren ... me too

I was scared today.

Very good.

I need to know the blood

Of that man immediately.

- A +?

- Yes.

Well, it will take

The 6 bags.

Prepare for transfusion.

- What's up?

- You have to go.

- What's going on?

- We have to go.

We have to

cross the border.

It's bad. The rebels

They used many civilians.

For what?

Go Go!

We will give you the

Details later!

No, no, Winnie.

came back! Sam, come back!

It is dangerous for civilians,

you do not go! Come back!

"Stay with us, Moussa.
- People die, they need us all.

Is not safe. The men

They rape at night. We will go.

No, I am the Coordinator of

draft! I decide here!

- We're brave.

- No, Sam!

Wait, wait. A second, for

favor. Wren, what do you want to do?

We will not take the children.

We'll all go. If it

You decide, we walk back.

No, stop all!

Let's move on!

People die!

- Ride back.

- Go Go!

There was something precipitous

In what we did,

somewhat blinding in the

Addiction to the emergency ...

to allow us to

The children will accompany us ...

how confidently

Cross the border.

Miguel was not

The same ... and neither.

But together

They needed us.

And being needed ...

I was everything.

We started to work.

Let Farber handle it.

Dr. Petersen?

Yes I'm going!

Why do they have to

So many young people

... boys, with

Wounds on the chest?

They were used as shields

By the rebels.

I have to bring the book.

My name is ... Malesh Roe.

Where is my daughter Fatou?

Is she alive?

He wants to be with his daughter.

If we find it and find it

With life, we will operate it.

What did you say?

She wants to be with her daughter.

You want to live?

God decides that .

It does not depend on it.

He wants to be with his daughter.

That's what he said!

What? You can not do that.

- You can not do that!

- What is your daughter's name?

- Fatou ...

- Fatou? Fatou Roe?

Do not let the

Patients decide!

Beatrice ...

His daughter's name is Fatou

Roe. Look to see if she's alive.

- Now?

- Yes, now!

US...

... we will let ... Malesh?

Malesh ...

We will let Malesh

Meet with his daughter.

It's not right, Wren.

It is for pain.

For pain.

I will not let you suffer

In this operation,

He's going to die anyway.

Make it comfortable now! There!

Who leaves now?

We have to open the chest and find

The pulmonary hilum in one of 10 years.

Are you going to attend?

Sister, are all the

People of the village?

All the children you saw?

I'm looking for Fatou Roe.

Have you seen Fatou Roe?

Wren we need you,

are you coming?

I'm looking for a satellite phone. I have

They call and stop this today.

Are you going to stop all this? All right.

Wren, we need your

Help in now.

- Wren!

- We're not helping!

All right, pack. Go away, go!

Go away no more

Can you stand it!

Make your call!

And if your daughter is alive,

you'll take both

Enjoy the West.

Please, can you leave the

Ghost of your father today?

Please.

Do you think you know who I am?

You do not know who I am.

Make it clear:
I do not like it

Someone tell me who I am.

More than another

Thing in the world.

I'd rather be told what to do,

Let me know who or what I am.

Well, I will not return to you

Say that, okay?

And I'm going to look ...

I'll think of many

Things to do.

Like:
"Sit down."

"Work".

You're a little wonder.

Hears...

What?

I was thinking...

You still are

perfect for me.

Are you coming or are you leaving?

Ma'am, decide

Of a good time!

Wren ...

Wren, MSF wants

That we stay.

Wren, it's almost time

Of the curfew.

Very good.

We're leaving.

Why did not you marry?

Life is hard.

You need someone else

With whom to share it.

- You're good?

- Yes, and you?

They will see.

Daddy, are we leaving? Yes.

Yes, we're leaving.

Triage patients

They left a minute ago.

They just left.

Come on, fast, get on the

car. Put your head down!

Sam, get in!

Get down!

Silence!

This is a witch.

What are you, brother?

Is a doctor.

Do you have anything for us?

Princess, it's your toys.

- Move!

- Yes, move!

- What are they doing? What...?

- Wren, wait.

What are they doing?

Give me your watch, white.

You're a doctor too.

Why are you wearing my watch?

Did not you hear? For what

you want? Your time is over.

- Wait wait!

Funny doctor!

I have a gun, no

You are nothing doctor

Release the watch!

You, you.

- Come here.

Come here, come.

- Sam! Sam!

- Here, come.

Put it there, put it there.

He is your father?

Answers? Always

You do what dad says

- You can not talk?

- He does not understand, he has problems.

Can not speak?

Listen out.

- I'll be your father and your mother.

- Please.

- Do not? So what do you live for?

- Please. Please no.

You're going to give me your

Son, okay?

Please. Please no.

Can you obey

Someone other than your father?

Do you think

Father is anyone?

Now you'll see.

No, no, no, stop!

Miguel? Miguel?

I will inform about

That I am witnessing!

Report what is

Witnessing, well.

Are you enjoying yourself?

You, hit your father.

Miguel?

Did you hear the Commander?

Does it stick to your father?

T disparaste la bala.

Oye, Miguel! Miguel!

Miguel nos vamos!

Miguel!

Wren, entra al auto.

Wren?

Vamos!

Siempre recuerdo lo blancas

que eran sus camisas.

Las pequeas

camisas de Sam.

Cmo consegua que

estuvieran siempre tan blancas?

Creo que slo tena una.

La lavaba l mismo.

Quiero que sepas que siempre te

he esperado aunque no lo quisiera.

Yo tambin te esper, Wren.

Nunca volviste.

Lo intent.

S, lo intent, es slo que...

Saba que no me quedara.

Entre nosotros y la guerra...

No s si habr un

"nosotros" sin guerra.

Dime que eso no es cierto.

No puedo.

T s?

No.

- Dime que no es cierto.

- No es cierto.

No es cierto.

Dmelo, dime

que no es cierto.

Es...

Una sola historia, Wren.

Qu historia te cuentas

a ti mismo ahora, Miguel?

Una en la que me pides que

regrese al campo contigo?

S, lo he pensando.

Pero...

- Pero sera demasiado pedir, no?

- S.

Sera injusto para m.

Muy injusto.

S.

Y t, cul

historia te cuentas?

La historia donde

me quedo aqu...

Y tenemos una...

...hermosa casa en

medio de la nada,

con hijos dando vueltas?
Donde t trabajas desde casa

y yo soy mdico de familia...

No.

Donde perteneces es all.

Al campo.

Pero ese es quien eres.

- S.

- Pero me atemoriza.

Muchsimo.

Ojal pudiera...

- Lo dese.

- Ojal yo...

Cuando era pequea, mi padre

a menudo estaba ausente.

Un da le pregunt:

"Pap qu es lo ms

inesperado que hayas visto?"

Me dijo que haba estado

en algn lugar de Cambodia.

En una isla...

Ayudando a los refugiados

a principios de los aos 70.

Era un joven mdico,

atendiendo a un anciano

sentado contra un rbol.

Le pregunt al hombre:

"Si pudiera tener lo que

quisiera, qu elegira?"

Mi padre supuso que

dira comida o dinero.

Pero el hombre contest:

"Querra un libro cualquiera, de

literatura clsica francesa."

El hombre haba sido

profesor de una universidad

hasta el da, el da

que fue desplazado.

Creo que vemos a los refugiados

como todo lo que han sido.

Com si no fuesen

como nosotros.

Pero son como nosotros.

Son obreros,

contadores, maestros,

albailes, agricultores...

Tienen familias...

Y tienen sueos.

Sueos.

Una gran parte del mundo actual

ha sido apartada de sus sueos.

Las guerras atacan los sueos.

La pobreza ataca los sueos.

Las catstrofes naturales

atacan los sueos.

La enfermedad ataca los sueos.

Pero si creen en ellos,

ms que en su dinero,

ellos alcanzarn sus sueos.

Y les dir por qu:

Porque los sueos

no son un lujo.

Como tampoco los refugiados

no son como nosotros.

Son iguales a nosotros.

Y como iguales, sus sueos

ms que el aire mismo

es la ms fundamental de

todas las necesidades humanas.

Querida Wren:

Todo lo que realmente

quera decir es que...

S que te volver a ver.

No s cundo.

Buscar por

todo el desierto...

Y dir tu nombre.

Y ver tu rostro.

El rostro de la persona

que ms me am,

que me cont

entre los vivos...

...cuando yo no

poda hacerlo.

Un piloto norteamericano de 20

aos que trabajaba para la MSF,

evacuaba mujeres y nios de

una escuela durante los ataques.

Fueron abatidos.

Todos murieron.

Miguel estaba entre ellos.

Cuando pensaba en l

poda sentir mi estmago,

las hileras de

costillas bajo mi piel.

Yo exista de un modo diferente

a cuando no pensaba en l.

Antes de conocerle,

era una idea que tena.

Pero no exista realmente.

Recordaba quin era

yo al recordarle a l.
