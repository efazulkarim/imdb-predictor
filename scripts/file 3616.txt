[WAVES CRASHING] 
WOMAN: 
the most common pathways 
of energy production 
in microorganisms, 
who live along the 
hydrothermal vents, 
are oxidation or reduction 
of sulfur compounds. 
The most common electron donor along the vents is 
hydrogen sulfide, 
making oxidation 
of sulfur-containing compounds the base of the food 
web in this environment. 
The microorganisms 
capable of oxidizing 
or reducing sulfur compounds 
show amazing diversity. 
Over 161 gram-negative 
sulfur-oxidizing bacteria species have been found to inhabit 
the hydrothermal vents. 
Bacteria in this environment are often thought of as all being autotrophs, but of these 161 species, 
over 97% are also capable 
of heterotrophic growth. 
In addition, 37% perform 
fermentation. 
Furthermore, the sulfate 
reducers known to be present, 
include at least nine different genera, including gram-negative... Yeah, I see. 
I understand why. 
No, to us it'd make 
a huge difference. 
She'll be out soon.

You had enough? 
[RECORDING CONTINUES] 
While most are rod shaped... 
They want us on the boat 
now for a team debriefing. 
DANI: 
in the tank next time? 
That's dangerous. 
Each suit is designed 
specifically 
for each aquanaut, so... 
Thank you, Paul, but you don't have to indulge her every whim. 
DANI: 
Why do you torture 
him like that? 
He's too young 
to defend himself. 
I'll race you. 
- No. 
- Come on now. 
THUMBS: 
I don't like you! 
CAPT. ANCTIL: 
go over the order of the dives, so that you can 
communicate with each other 
about who can help log, 
as some of you will be prepping and not available to log. 
All right? 
We start from here, 
so Jonas and Ren are up first, - Lucky you. 
- with tienne as the pilot, 
for the first dive 
in the Cadiz Gulf. 
Then we're going to 
hug the coastline, 
going west of Ireland 
Page 3/42
and Britain 
into the Norwegian Sea. 
There, Gustavo and 
Maria are next, 
with Frank piloting 
around the Faroe Island. 
Frank, who is also taking 
Annie and Mark down, 
here near Iceland where 
we'll spend the most time, 
and do several dives, okay? 
It's a complete reversal, 
I'm sorry. 
CAPT. ANCTIL: 
And then, our deepest dive, 
Thumbs and Dani, 
are last, around Jan Mayen, 
with tienne as a pilot, okay? 
There are definite 
advantages in going last. 
They're gonna be logging 
and not prepping, 
and the sub will be tested. 
I'm not thinking about that. 
Then what's up? 
I realized I've never 
been lonely before. 
[CHUCKLING] 
Welcome to the planet. 
It's possible there's 
no service where he is. 
He's working in 
Northern Kenya, right? 
Or he just stopped calling, 
stopped being interested. 
THUMBS: 
He's just stuck somewhere 
without reception. 
For a month. 
THUMBS:

[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] 
What do you got for us? 
I have a bona fide source, 
willing to give up an 
operational bomb unit in Europe. They want to hit train stations. Where's the link? 
In Southern Somalia. 
What's on the 
table for the source? 
British passport, 
we want him. 
We found him, 
we'll get him. 
He's my source, 
so I'm going in alone. 
Somalia is not a good idea, J. 
JAMES: 
Check this out. 
We are talking about 
bombs all over Europe. 
If there's even a chance we can get out in front of that, we have to take it. We don't know who they are, 
where they are. 
Their whole pipeline 
of intelligence 
and soldiers waiting 
Page 5/42
to stream in. 
You don't even know what faction is in charge in Kismayo right now. Well, I was hoping you could help me out with who's in charge there. Oh, come on, James, 
this isn't Afghanistan. 
WOLFGANG: 
So, how are you getting in? 
Small plane. 
I'll use my water 
engineer alias. 
I'll meet my contact 
at Kismayo airport. 
BOB: 
and you're gonna dig up some wells? 
BOB: 
that's the safest. 
JAMES: 
once I'm there. 
Same as last time. 
WOLFGANG:

Guys, do me a favor, 
just tell me something 
that's gonna help me, would you? Fuck. 
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

Yeah. 
He was with Osama in 2001, 
wasn't he? 
Page 6/42
BOB: 
apparently he's in Somalia now. We'll get you intel on him, 
whatever we dig up. 
Give us a few days, J, we'll 
contact you on a safe line.

Stuck my heart on my chest 
Evening.

I've got a good Japanese one. 
Konnichiwa, let's go Japanese. - You play rugby?

Why did you stop, Marcel? 
Oh, you know,

[BREATHING HEAVILY] 
Oh. 
JAMES: 
I think you're following me. 
Or you're following 
me in advance. 
- Tricky. 
- [JAMES LAUGHS] 
Mr. More, 
the newspaper you wanted. 
Thank you, Beatrice. 
You're definitely following me. I haven't even had a 
chance to shower yet. 
I love the smell of sweat. 
- I have to do some work. 
- Is this your room?

[KNOCK ON DOOR] 
- [KNOCKING CONTINUES] 
- Yes? 
JAMES: 
to take you to lunch. 
It's open. 
[MUSIC CONTINUES] 
Carry on, Professor. 
How did you know 
I was a professor? 
I looked at your name on the 
letter you picked up this morning. What are you a professor of? 
Take a guess. 
Um... 
- Music? 
- [LAUGHING] 
DANI: 
Do you mind turning 
it down a little bit? 
It's awfully loud in here. 
I mean, you couldn't 
really hear me... [CHUCKLES] 
knock on the door even, so... 
[MUSIC STOPS] 
- Thank you, Law? 
- [SCOFFS] Please. 
- Uh, anthropology? 
- Wrong again. 
Well, just... tell me then. 
I apply mathematics to the 
study of life in the ocean. 
JAMES: 
You're an oceanographer? 
There's no such 
discipline as oceanography. 
I'm a bio-mathematician. 
It's the working of the science to whatever is in the sea. 
Or at the bottom of it. 
Page 9/42
Precisely. 
It's quite rude, 
just sitting there, watching me. Insisting that 
we eat something? 
I know, it's entirely 
unreasonable. 
[LAUGHING] 
So, what ocean is your favorite? It has to be that one, 
the Atlantic. 
JAMES: 
Carry on. 
- About? 
- The sea. 
I feel certain it's going 
to tell me all about you. 
All right, then, um... 
close your eyes. 
You're determined not 
to let me eat, aren't you? 
Close them. 
The ocean has five layers. 
- Five. 
- Are you going to cooperate? 
Mm-hm. 
- I want you to picture this. 
- Okay. 
Yes, it has five layers 
and the first one is epipelagic. It contains all the plant 
life and coral reefs. 
Whatever memory 
you have of baptism, 
or any other form of submersion, is there in the blue water. 
The next layer, 
is mesopelagic. 
This is the twilight zone... 
into which... 
blue and all other 
colors and light vanish. 
[LAUGHING] 
Page 10/42
Everything under the 
mesopelagic is night. 
If you were with me 
in a submersible, 
that's like 
a deep-sea submarine... 
Is it yellow? 
- Of course it is. 
- Excellent. 
If you were with me 
in one of those, 
you would have spent 
two hours at least, 
in the blackness you're 
in now, to get down to... 
You can open your eyes. 
The hadopelagic, 
which is what interests me. 
Hadal from the Greek "Hades", 
meaning unseen. 
Doesn't it mean hell? 
To some. 
This is the other world 
in our world. 
It's just miles and 
miles of blackness? 
No one knows much 
about the mantle. 
They think it has no life, 
and therefore no 
possibility of reanimation, 
and is so without 
scientific interest. 
I disagree. 
It needs to be explored. 
What? Excuse me, 
what exactly is it that you do? I... I study... 
I collect samples, 
from what I think is... 
the living bit 
of the mantle. 
The first few kilometers 
underlying the Hadal deep. 
Page 11/42
I believe that all life and... regeneration in our world 
belongs to it. 
We refuse to value what's 
down there because it's dark. 
We want to forget there 
is darkness in our world, and... and to be on a beach 
is to be lucky. 
- [LAUGHING] 
- We don't educate ourselves. 
Our world is 
firstly about power, 
it's only secondly 
about education. 
[JAMES CLEARS THROAT] 
- [LAUGHING] 
- What? 
No, don't worry about me, 
just you carry on. 
No, I'm just writing down 
what you just said 
- about power and education. 
- Mm-hmm. 
- Oh, wow, okay. 
- I like it. 
I'm actually going down on one of those submersibles in a couple of weeks. I've waited years 
for this opportunity. 
Come on, congratulations. 
[LAUGHING] 
- [GLASSES CLINK] 
- Thank you. 
What do you do? 
I consult on water 
projects in Africa, actually. 
Hey, we've got water in common. - You work for charity? 
- The British government. 
You live in Africa? 
Nairobi. 
Do you like it? 
I do, most of the time. 
Page 12/42
Nairobi gets a bit 
treacherous sometimes. 
People say it's like 
an African river, 
you can't see into it, 
you don't know where 
the crocodiles are, 
and you can't see the 
rapids coming at you. 
But, I tell you, 
it's got its own... 
luster. 
I kinda miss it, 
when I'm away too long. 
Wonderful place. 
I have a pool. 
JAMES: 
descending to 
the bottom of the ocean, 
makes us challenge our sense 
of self and where we came from? And that we are not 
interested in your work, 
because we don't want to have 
come from the scum in the ocean? It kind of makes sense to me. 
- Does it? 
- Yeah. 
DANI: 
to fight over... 
When I drop everything... 
I wanna make a case for my 
theory on life down there. 
And having been down there 
it gets more complicated. 
What counts the most is 
being published in Nature. 
So, you're going 
to go down there 
and you're going to be 
surrounded by water, 
and infinite blackness 
Page 13/42
in what, a month? 
Yeah. 
Are you afraid 
something might happen? 
I try not to think about that. Why? 
What would happen? 
If the submersible 
would crack? 
Mm-hmm. 
Water would come in and 
my lungs would seal off, 
and I would die a dry drowning by acidosis and hypoxia. 
What would that feel like? 
Well, if anything 
were to happen, 
it would probably just be us 
getting stuck down there, 
unable to move. 
And there's only five days 
of oxygen in the sub, 
and no one can reach 
you down there. 
Why? 
There's only one of those 
deep sea submersibles in Europe. So, I wouldn't drown, 
I'd suffocate. 
I'd have a lot of time 
to think about things. 
[WIND BLOWING] 
DANI: 
tattoo on your arm? 
JAMES: 
- You were a paratrooper? 
- Yeah, I was. 
I was very young, though. It was just a short service commission. This is what 
I wanted to show you. 
Now this is what 
Page 14/42
I came here for. 
There was 5,000 
Canadian soldiers, 
and a thousand British soldiers tried to take this beach. 
The guns inside that bunker 
killed every one of them. 
It was an incredible sacrifice. [WAVES CRASHING] 
Hey, hey, hey! 
[LAUGHING] 
Ah! 
Here. 
That was cold! 
What's got into you, 
Mr. More? 
You've been talking to me now 
for a long time about the world, and whales and the ocean, 
and, Dani, you have barely 
used the words I or me. 
You've learned to listen 
awfully well, haven't you? 
Why did you have to 
acquire that skill? 
Why would you say that 
I had to acquire it? 
'Cause no one is an 
expert at anything, 
if there is not a burning need somewhere to have that particular skill. 
I have sisters. 
Would you like 
another drink? 
- No. 
- Okay. 
DANI: 
water body, since you asked me? The human body. 
It's my favorite body, 
It's mainly water. 
- So much cleverer than me. 
- I doubt that.

[BIRDS CHIRPING] 
This is what 
we found for you, J. 
Yusef Mohamud al-Afghani 
is now indeed 
a forward commander 
of al-Qaeda in Somalia. 
He seems to be running 
the show there. 
If ever you see him, 
you're close. 
There's another guy, 
James, Saif Al-Husni. 
Was a suicide bomber. 
Pulled the ring, but the 
vest didn't detonate. 
PTSD big time, 
extremely violent, apparently. He probably thinks 
he'll never die. 
He probably wants to die. 
WOLFGANG: 
if you're really going. 
DANI: 
there's salp and jellyfish, 
whose vertical migrations 
are equivalent in scale to... 
to us, as if these birds were 
just to fly up from the trees, and go straight up into space. On a planetary scale, 
the birds crawl. 
What? 
We go to sleep and you're 
nervous to meet me over again, is that what's happening here? I usually don't see 
Page 17/42
the person the day after. 
I work. 
Don't you think I should at 
least know something about you? Oh, I get it, 
you want to pry. 
- I don't want to pry. 
- What do you want to know? 
I want to know about you. 
About being a soldier, 
for instance. 
You're going to ask me what 
it's like to kill somebody? 
- No. 
- Good. 
Tell me, 
tell me anything. 
Anything that will 
tell me about you. 
[WAVES CRASHING] 
Then you're going 
to go into the sea? 
It's getting awfully cold, and I really think you should go in soon. What's the most essential 
thing about being a soldier? 
Obedience. 
Okay. 
Death. 
It gets very real when you're watching somebody die in front of you. 
You're thinking, 
is this all I am? 
Is this all I added up to? 
And all the clichs are true. 
You're thinking, why now? 
Why did it have to be... 
this happen before I realize 
what life truly is? 
It's direct, it's immediate, 
and it's their whole 
life exposed to you. 
Did you think about 
your own death a lot? 
Page 18/42
I did, and I do. 
I've heard people telling me that they've had those exact same thoughts when they fell in love. 
No, you don't die 
when you fall in love. 
Have you fallen in love? 
I think you should go in 
for your swim now. 
Time's up, eh? 
No, no don't! 
No, no, not in my clothes, 
not in my clothes! 
[LAUGHING] 
- It's cold. 
- No, don't throw me in! 
No! [LAUGHING] 
[WAVES CRASHING] 
[SCREAMING] 
You are not going 
to win me over. 
Yes, I am. 
That's exactly what 
I'm going to do. 
[LAUGHS] Congratulations. 
Where did you guys grow up? 
Sydney, London, Stockholm, 
depending on 
Daddy's work, really. 
My parents were the ones 
who used to take me here. 
Dani, do you even 
know a poor person? 
[LAUGHING] 
- Yes. 
- Oh, yeah? 
[LAUGHING] Oh. 
- You. 
- Me? 
No, no, no, no, no, 
I am not poor. 
I can afford to come to a 
place like this once a year. 
Is it true that 
Page 19/42
there's oxygen stored 
in the micro life at 
the bottom of the ocean, 
and that one day 
it's going to run out? 
We shouldn't run out... 
if we take the right steps. 
I mean, we are entering an age where everything will be quantified. What we see as abundant, 
will be limited. 
So, oxygen will be like 
water and minerals and fuels. 
Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
Like oxygen, like... 
like air-oxygen? 
Like oxygen? 
[LAUGHING] 
Yeah, if we keep going 
the way we're going. 
Wow. 
That's why I need to 
get to the bottom of it. 
[LAUGHING] 
Was that a science 
person's joke? [LAUGHING] 
Not everyone can be 
as witty as you. 
[LAUGHING] I know, but... 
it was rubbish. 
Oh, I think I'm slightly 
less attracted to you now. 
[LAUGHING] 
Just look at you. 
You mongrel. 
Half Australian, 
some Swedish, 
a touch of English. 
DANI: 
are here to stay. 
I'm going to remember this. 
What if I come and 
visit you in Nairobi? 
Page 20/42
I want to swim in your pool. 
[COFFEE MACHINE GRINDING] 
Don't, I have 58 minutes. 
Read that. 
Did you read it? 
Just feels like I'm... 
reading the same news 
all over again. 
- It's not interesting enough? - It's tough 'cause I... 
feel like there's nothing 
we can do about it. 
We could read about it, 
we could get interested. 
We could educate ourselves and get involved in a solution. 
How is there a solution 
to a problem that has roots 
in ancient conflicts, 
where religious... 
What are you saying, you don't think there's a solution? 
I don't know. 
This is the same 
as your work, Dani. 
Trying to get people interested in potentially 
life-saving information, 
that lies at the bottom 
of the sea, in the dark, 
so nobody wants 
to know about it. 
It's the exact same thing. 
Get them interested, 
educate them, 
get them involved in a solution, and that is amazing. 
But this is our world, 
too, isn't it? 
I don't know if 
that's our world. 
Oh.

You're alive. 
Good. 
Drink this. 
Why are you here? 
I've told your men, 
I'm a water engineer. 
I wanted... 
I still want to build... 
a water system in Kismayo, 
I was invited. 
Not to do something else? 
No, I'm just... 
[WHISPERING] 
What's your 
business with Sharif? 
He was the tribal leader 
in Kismayo, 
and I was going to teach the 
water recognition system to him. How do you know him? 
I didn't, he contacted me. 
He did? How? 
He got in touch with the 
Page 26/42
charity that I work for 
that installs wells 
in refugee camps. 
They asked me to 
meet him, so I did. 
Do you understand that 
we are fighting a war here? 
I understand. 
Then what is this? 
It was a mistake, 
I was a young man. 
- I needed a job! 
- Coming here was a mistake! 
Do you have children, 
a wife? 
I'm not married. 
Your people rely on me 
for clean water. 
We shall call you Biyole. 
That means water boy. 
My name is James. 
Do you drink alcohol, Biyole? 
Yeah. 
Alcohol separates you 
from your creator. 
Yeah, no doubt. 
It is important to me 
that you are being treated... 
generously. It is Allah's wish. Thank you.

This is more serious,

My name is James More. 
More? 
I was told to 
call you Mr. Water. 
Doctor, I haven't 
spoken to my family. 
They don't know that I'm okay. Can you please 
help me with that? 
No. 
MAN: 
In particular, 
deposit feeders were at

Don't. 
I've prepared a dozen samples 
for you, minus one. 
I'll be all right, 
I can handle it. 
You sure? 
Wouldn't say it if I couldn't. I looked over the work. 
We'll be fine, as long 
as you do your part. 
I'd be fine if I had 
signal at some point. 
I mean, we've been out now 
in the middle of the ocean, 
with no signal, 
multiple dives, 
and it just... 
frustrates me, okay? 
Okay. 
So, you can't reach him. 
Page 28/42
Why don't you focus on your work and put him out of your mind. 
[SIGHS] 
Cover of Nature. 
Isn't that what we 
promised each other? 
Why don't you look at me, 
Dani? 
I know all about self-sabotage. I'm the expert on it. 
I want you to tell me now that this is not you doubting yourself. - This is not what this is. 
- It's not doubt. 
'Cause it deserves the cover, 
not just to be published. 
Searching for life that may 
share the same way of life, 
that we may eventually 
find in water on Mars? 
Possibly proving that 
a billion years ago, 
the same ecosystems 
existed here and there? 
You've touched 
the limits of life. 
You've touched it. 
And now we have to wrap 
our whole hands around it, 
and bring it to the world... 
and finish this. 
Ifremer, they've partnered 
with us, there's a lot at stake, - a lot of money has been spent. - I know, I know. 
Now is not the time to 
doubt yourself, Dani. 
I know. 
Good. 
Morning, Ms. Flinders. 
- Captain. 
- Mr. Darren. 
Thank you for 
coming down, um... 
Page 29/42
Do you think it would 
be possible for me 
to go ashore after 
the next two dives? 
I'm having some difficulties 
finalizing my calculations. 
You mean go ashore 
and stay ashore? 
The other teams 
don't need you to log? 
- I can handle that work. 
- And where would you... 
We would be in reach 
of the Faroe Islands, 
after Mark and Annie, 
I think. 
- Right? 
- Yeah. 
I could fly to Iceland from 
there and then on to Jan Mayen. I don't see why not, 
if your program sanctions it. 
- It does. 
- All right, then. 
We'll arrange a boat 
to come and pick you up. 
Thank you. 
- Good? 
- Mm. 
There should be a ban on 
injecting the suicide bombers 
with drugs to limit 
their ability to think. 
They do that? 
I saw it, in Mogadishu. 
I was really ashamed. 
They also do it in Pakistan. 
Why are you telling me this? 
Why are you talking to me? 
You will be gone soon, 
one way or the other. 
What do you mean by that? 
They will not kill you. 
Emir Yusef has promised. 
Page 30/42
Oh, that's good to know. 
And there is 
no one else here 
to talk to 
with an education. 
[LAUGHING] 
DR. SHADID: 
do about the wells in Kismayo? 
JAMES: 
I came here to find out. 
DR. SHADID: 
too expensive for the poor. 
Do the local authorities have 
control over all the water sources? - I do not know. 
- You need to find out. 
You need to drive out 
the water profiteers 
by any means necessary. 
Wait. 
[SIGHS] Well, you need to 
ascertain the depth of each well, and the quality of 
the water in it. 
So, for example, the closer 
a well is to the sea, 
the more likely that 
water is to be brackish. 
You have to find out how many people are using it, plot this all on a map. I can help you with this. 
This is what I do, 
this is my job. 
Already you are. 
Here, only the air is free. 
Not a day goes by 
without a child in my care 
dying of some 
curable illness. 
The people have no work. 
They have not enough food. 
Page 31/42
They have no school and this is something we intend to correct. When it rains, the mud mixes with the waste from the latrines. 
I do believe with so many people packed in such conditions, 
Somalia will generate a plague that will spread around the world. Cholera? 
A new plague. 
You going to 
turn it into a weapon? 
[GROANS] 
I am a doctor. 
Who keeps company 
with killers. 
We have cholera here already. 
- JAMES: 
- Here? 
- To the United Nations. 
- Never. 
- Even UNICEF? 
- Especially UNICEF. 
Such an organization 
that promises so much 
yet delivers so little 
to the children? 
What is necessary is 
to turn the Crusaders 
back from the Muslim 
lands of Somalia, 
so that the people here can 
live in a pure Islamic state. 
What's more important to you, 
treating the women and children that come to your clinic 
and looking for your help, 
or... Or... Or following jihad? I see both as one treatment. 
Medicine is mercy, 
jihad is duty. 
What about me, 
am I a Crusader? 
Page 32/42
I came here 
to bring clean water. 
Allah will ask payment of you. You said I was 
going to be spared. 
I need to go home. 
[SOBBING] 
I need to go back to her. 
[CRYING] 
Who am I to know 
the will of God? 
You may die tomorrow. 
Or... you may become 
a blessed one.

get your work done. 
Thank you. 
Captain's orders. 
Is it possible to dock 
by any of those rocks? 
- Just for a few minutes? 
- Sure. 
[BIRDS CAWING] 
What are you doing? 
I'm counting. 
Lichens. 
Some of the species 
here are very rare. 
You think they're shells, 
but if you come closer, 
they're like tiny trees, 
little forests. 
And this one here is 
Page 33/42
the marriage between a... 
a fungus and a cyan-bacteria. 
If you would magnify the edges, you wouldn't be able to see, 
where life begins 
and where it ends. 
It just dissolves from... 
from life into non-life.

You will do important

I so wish I could have 
shared this with him. 
What would you 
have told him now? 
I would have told him that... 
down here, 
it's not photosynthetic, 
like everything on the surface, but chemosynthetic. 
I would have told him 
that life down here 
exists without light, 
and that it grows, 
because of the 
chemical energy just 
pouring out of those cracks, 
from the core of our Earth. 
And he would have 
understood that? 
Yes.

We could float up, hit a chimney that could fall on us, trap us. We can't move at all anymore. 
Right, let's go through

We will take our place
