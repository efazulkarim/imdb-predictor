[ Radio chatter ]

LUCY:
You know, we're gonna

probably have to sleep

in my sister's empty room.

Probably don't even hold

my hand around around her.

JOSE:

It's gonna be good, right?

Hey, um, you told her

I was coming, right?

I actually haven't gotten

a chance to talk to them yet.

Stop this.

Are you serious?

Just make a good impression.

They're very protective.

Oh. Oh, okay.

Oh, I see...

I see the game we're playing.

I literally almost...

I was like, "Just leave me here.

I'm just gonna live

in the subway forever."

- God.

- They're gonna love you.

Oh, yeah. I really hope so.

Yeah. Yeah.

WOMAN:

exit in an orderly fashion.

All service at this station

is suspended.

- That's weird, right?

- This is an emergency.

I don't know.

Trains go out all the time.

At least we didn't get

stuck in the tunnel.

All service at this station

is suspended.

That's like a real-life

thing that happens?

You just get stuck down there?

Yeah, one time

we had a blackout,

and I had to use my phone

for light.

- Are you serious?

- Mm-hmm.

That... You just described

my worst nightmare to me,

just right back at me.

Gives me anxiety just to think

about being stuck there.

Why are you acting

like such a baby?

I'm not a baby. You're a baby.

Your face is a baby.

But it's a normal

human-being thing

not to want to get stuck

underground, you know.

Why do you say I'm weird?

Tell me.

Because you're not

being very manly.

Aren't you supposed to be all,

you know, protective and tough?

Oh. Okay, cool.

I'm supposed to be

protective of you.

I would, if I had, like,

an incentive.

- Like what?

- Um, I can't think of...

Yeah, it feels a little better.

- Mm-hmm.

- I... Yeah.

Manlier, macho, I'd say.

Shut up.

Okay, this is a little weird.

Nobody here, huh?

LUCY:

Where'd everybody go?

JOSE:

I don't know.

They're just ahead of us, right?

LUCY:

It's probably just a drill.

- After you.

- Thank you.

- Yeah.

- [ Man screaming ]

Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

What the f***?

- [ Screaming ]

- LUCY:
Holy sh*t!

- Holy sh*t.

- We got to...

- No, no, no. Don't.

- What? We just leave him there?

All right.

- Um, let's just...

- Let's just...

No, no, no. Let's just go.

We got to get out of here.

JOSE:

All right. What...

LUCY:

Is there police around?

JOSE:

Where the f*** is everybody?

LUCY:

Let's get up to the street.

- [ Gunfire ]

- JOSE:
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

- Back up. Back up.

- [ Helicopter blades whirring ]

- This is not normal.

- What the hell's going on?

LUCY:
Something seriously

must be wrong.

[ Radio chatter ]

JOSE:

Holy sh*t.

MAN:

Emergency alert.

LUCY:
I-I don't know. I've never

seen anything like that.

This is an active combat zone.

Deadly force will be

employed against...

All right.

No, no, no.

Where are you going?

You stay here where it's safe.

I'm just gonna go check it out.

Honey, I'll be right back, okay?

- Don't. No!

- Stop.

Okay. Um, I'm...

I'm gonna go get help.

I'm gonna go get help.

Well, grab what you can.

Come on, give me

F***ing chump change, man.

Hey. Hey.

You ain't got nothing, do you?

Get on the bed.

No?

White b*tch got

something to say, huh?

MAN #1:
Hey, you think

you're better than us?

- Huh?

- No, I don't.

Bushwick is our neighborhood.

When you white b*tches

gonna learn that?

I'm from here, and I'm just

trying to go home.

- Oh, you're from here? Oh.

- MAN #1:
Look at that.

- Oh she's got tears.

- She's from here.

Get the f*** out of here,

you're from here.

MAN #1:

I will give you a reason to cry.

How about that?

MAN #2:

Yeah. One big-ass reason.

- [ Inhales sharply ]

- Damn.

Let's see what

you got under here.

Looks good.

- Oh!

- Oh! What the f***?

Who do you think...

- [ Gunshot ]

- [ Both grunting ]

- [ Gunshot ]

- Oh! Aah!

Oh, my God!

Oh!

You f***ing b*tch.

[ Crying ]

STUPE:

Are you okay?

LUCY:

Are they dead?

[ Door opens ]

[ Water running ]

- What are you doing in my house?

- [ Door closes ]

I'm... I'm sorry.

You can't just come into

someone's house like that.

LUCY:

They followed me in here.

STUPE:

You need to leave.

- They were gonna attack me.

- You need to get out of here.

Do you know what's going on?

There's, like, a whole

f***ing army out there

that's just killing people.

And I was on the L train,

and there was a man...

STUPE:

Why are you out here?

- LUCY:
What?

- Why are you in Bushwick?

LUCY:

I-I live here.

And I'm just...

I was trying to...

I'm just...

I'm home from school,

and I'm trying to just get

to my grandma's house,

and she just lives

a couple blocks away.

And I...

F***. I was supposed to call her

when I got off the...

STUPE:
The cells are overloaded

or blocked.

I don't have any cell service.STUPE:

You're not gonna get through.

She's probably freaking out

because I was supposed to be

there already by now.

[ Breathes raggedly ]

Oh, God.

Oh, God.

Hey.

Hey.

[ Breathing heavily ]

Can you tell me your name?

What's your name?

Hey.

Lucy.

Lucy.

Hey, just do me a fav...

LUCY:

Don't f***ing touch me.

Here. Have some water.

They declared martial law,

and my radio went dead.

Not just here, everywhere...

Boston, Chicago,

D.C., Manhattan.

LUCY:

Is, um... Is this 9/11 again?

Terrorists?

No, it's different.

It's more tactical.

LUCY:
Tactical? What do you...

What do you mean?

I mean it's more tactical.

This isn't an attack.

This is an invasion.

How do you know this?

I mean, this is...

This is Bush... Bushwick.

Who f***ing invades Bushwick?

I'm not sure who they are,

so we got to get out of here.

I...

This is just

really f***ing crazy sh*t.

I'm... I'm just really confused,

and I just want to know

what the f*** is going on.

Strategic plan.

It's overwhelm...

Overwhelming our defense system.

LUCY:

Are you a cop or something?

Janitor.

How do you know this?

I really want to just go home.

Good luck.

LUCY:

Wait, where are you going?

Hoboken.

LUCY:
Why?

My wife and my son are there.

LUCY:
Well, I just need to get

to Cypress Avenue.

It's just a couple blocks

that way.

Sorry. I can't help you.

No, no. Please.

Don't leave me here.

Please don't leave me here.

Please.

The main assault's

probably over.

They're gonna be

canvassing block by block.

Just keep your head down.

You'll be all right.

[ Lock clicks ]

[ Explosions, gunfire ]

Wait.

Sniper.

STUPE:

I got it.

Wait.

What the f*** are you doing?

[ Gunfire, siren wailing ]

Aah!

[ Gunshots ]

[ Man grunts, thud ]

- STUPE:
Stay down.

You're gonna get us both killed.

[ Gunshots ]

This is f***ed up.

We need to find cover.

[ Gunshots continue ]

Sh*t.

The school.

The school.

[ Gunshots ]

Oh, my God.

[ Breathing heavily ]

[ Grunts ]

Come on.

You know where you're going?

I used to go to school here.

What's upstairs?

There's a science lab

and a library

and a study hall and, um...

Can we get up to the roof?

Yeah. Teachers used to

go up there and smoke.

Okay. Let's get up there

and take a look around

and see if we can see out

on the street.

Then we get the hell

out of here.

Okay.

- [ Door opens ]

- Sh*t.

[ Radio chatter ]

Do you have a compact?

What?

A compact, the mirror.

Oh, God.

[ Bang ]

MAN:

Ah! Grenade!

Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

[ Both breathing heavily ]

Do you want them to figure out

we're up here?

Holy sh*t.

You're bleeding.

Yeah, I know.

I got to take care of it.

We can go over here.

Let's go over here.

[ Grunts ]

Oh, my God.

What are you gonna do?

Take this glass out of my leg.

Then cauterize this wound.

I'm gonna need you to help me.

LUCY:

What?

I can't do this.

I-I don't know

how to cauterize a leg.

You... You need a doctor.

Oh!

Hold that there.

Hold it there, just like that.

All right.

All right.

LUCY:

Oh, God.

STUPE:

When I take this glass out,

I'm gonna need you to count

to five for me, okay?

- LUCY:
Uh, uh, okay.

- STUPE:
Okay?

Take it out, count to five.

LUCY:

Okay. Yeah.

- Oh, God.

LUCY:

Oh, God.

STUPE:

All right, ready? Count.

LUCY:
One.

Two.

Three, four, five.

- Five.

- [ Groaning ]

Now what?

STUPE:
I need you to do

the other side for me.

- No.

- Just like I did.

- Oh, f***.

- I need you to do it.

I'm bleeding too much.

Okay?

Okay.

Uh...

STUPE:
Just like I did.

Heat the blade.

At least five seconds, okay?

No less, or it's not gonna work.

Ready?

- All right, do it.

- Okay.

STUPE:

Do it.

LUCY:

Okay. Okay. Oh, God.

- One.

- [ Sizzling ]

- Two.

- [ Groaning ]

LUCY:

Three, four, five.

Five.

Take the alcohol and pour...

Pour alcohol over it

really good, okay?

Really good, all over it.

[ Groaning ]

Oh, God. F***.

It f***ing stinks.

STUPE:
Okay.

Wrap it with that gauze.

Wrap it up good.

Nice and tight,

right over the wound.

- All right.

- Okay.

Take that tape and wrap it

around there nice and tight

so that gauze won't

come off... come off.

- Okay.

- Is this okay?

Really gonna do it like this?

Okay.

[ Tape tears ]

I did it.

[ Breathing heavily ]

Holy sh*t.

Holy sh*t.

How'd you learn how to do that?

I watched a lot of "ER."

I watched a lot of "ER."

I was in the military.

I was a Marine.

Please, take that.

Take it.

[ Gunshots ]

LUCY:

What's your name?

Stupe.

- LUCY:
Stupe?

- Call me Stupe. Yeah.

Well, I don't know

how to use a gun, Stupe.

Keep your finger

off the trigger.

- Don't point it at me.

- LUCY:
I'm sorry.

You look down the barrel.

You line up the front sight

and the back sight.

[ Helicopter blades whirring ]

When you're ready to shoot,

and not until

you're ready to shoot,

you put your finger

on the trigger,

and you shoot to kill.

[ Gunfire ]

Now, we got to get out of here.

Are you ready?

LUCY:

Wait, are you sure you can?

Yeah. I'm good.

You worry about you.

LUCY:
There's a fire escape.

Come on.

STUPE:

All right.

[ Groans ]

[ Siren wailing ]

Holy f***.

[ Indistinct talking ]

[ Gunfire ]

[ Alarm blaring ]

We're not gonna make it, are we?

We'll make it

one block at a time.

[ Siren wailing,

helicopter blades whirring ]

LUCY:

Who are they?

STUPE:

I don't know.

LUCY:

What if it's not just Brooklyn?

What if they're in Hoboken, too,

where your family's at?

[ Gunfire ]

[ Indistinct talking ]

STUPE:

My family's safe.

Come on.

[ Gunfire ]

[ Helicopter blades whirring ]

We can go to Mr. Argo's

It's right there.

Right there.

[ Explosion, people screaming ]

[ Gunfire ]

Yo, it's all free now.

Stock up.

[ Indistinct talking on radio ]

Is there any new info?

Who cares?

Just take whatever you want.

Don't ask questions.

Hey, yo. Let's go.

Are they saying

who's doing this?

You have a gun.

You figure it out. Peace.

FRAN:

The militants are American.

MAN:

We don't know that, Fran.

We don't know anything more

than the unreliable

eyewitness accounts,

and we just don't have

an official word as of yet.

FRAN:
Why are we being kept in

the dark about all this?

Why is it so important

to keep the public unaware

of our situation?

MAN:

Oh, you've got to be joking.

What you're insinuating

is paranoid and delusional.

FRAN:
I'm saying that,

over the last few years,

certain politicians have lied

and swindled and cheated

their way into office,

and this... this kind

of domestic terrorism

is not such an

illogical conclusion.

WOMAN:
We expect to hear

from the president shortly.

The government has issued

some initial guidelines.Stay inside.

Do not answer the door.

The U.S. military will be

setting up extraction points.

This information is coming in

very sporadically.

We'll keep broadcasting

as we get more info.

The f***ing government.

Bridges and tunnels are closed.

- Useless as usual.

- JFK and LaGuardia are closed.

They got to realize

how f***ed up this is.

Logan Airport is closed.

My grandmother is not

gonna understand.

If soldiers come to her house,

she's not gonna leave.

We have to get there

before they do.

Is she close?

She's about a block and a half

on Willoughby Street.

[ Thudding ]

Did you hear that?

Mr. Argo?

[ Gasps ]

Oh, my God.

Oh, God.

Mr. Argo, what happened?

Candy, they stole candy,

f***ing candy.

I didn't try to stop them,

but he still stabbed me.

LUCY:
Those guys?

They...

Yes.

Ohh.

It's all a game to them.

Mr. Argo?

Sh*t.

Mr. Argo?

[ Gunfire, people screaming ]

STUPE:
Lucy. Lucy, we got to get

the f*** out of here.

[ Breathing heavily ]

Okay.

[ Door opens ]

[ Door closes ]

[ Sirens wailing ]

[ Dog barking ]

My grandmother's house

is that way.

Let's go.

Oh, God.

Sh*t.

MAN:
Dude, get the f***ing bags.

We got to get out of here.

[ Banging ]

We f***ed that guy up,

some old dude.

Yo, man, got the keys.

- Got the keys.

- We got to go.

[ Clanging ]

Dragging your ass, man.

Come on, come on, come on.

Yo, come on, man.

Let's go.

- [ Gunshots ]

- What the f***?

- F***! Aah!

- [ Man groans ]

- Drive, drive, drive.

- [ Gunfire ]

[ Tires screech ]

Oh, my God.

[ Breathing heavily ]

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

STUPE:
Oh, God.

We need to stop the bleeding.

Oh, sh*t. Oh, sh*t. Oh, sh*t.

What the hell were you thinking?

[ Crying ]

Are you hit anywhere else?

No.

God damn it.

What were you thinking?

F***.

[ Moaning ]

My finger.

There's so much blood.

Oh, my God.

We'll fix it when we get to your

grandmother's house, all right?

Come on.

We got to keep moving.

Damn it.

LUCY:
That's the guy

that stabbed Mr. Argo.

He f***ing killed Mr. Argo

for no reason.

He was gonna shoot

this guy, too.

What are you doing?

Giving these

to help with the pain.

LUCY:

We can't just leave him here.

- We can't just leave him.

- We can't help him.

We got to keep moving!

Let's go.

Let's go!

LUCY:

Okay. Okay.

[ Gunshot in distance ]

[ Explosion, people screaming ]

[ Explosion, dog barking ]

[ Siren wailing in distance ]

MAN:
We're coming in.

Open the door.

We will use force.

This is an order.

[ Keys jingling ]

LUCY:

Grandma, where are you?

Grandma?

She must be upstairs.

[ Footsteps depart ]

Grandma?

Hello?

STUPE:
Lucy?

[ Crying ]

Her heart wasn't very strong.

I'm so sorry.

I'm so sorry I wasn't here.

Oh, God.

Oh, God.

STUPE:
We should...

We should get her off the floor.

Oh, God.

F***! God!

[ Crying ]

[ Zipper opens ]

[ Rattling ]

STUPE:
Gonna check the front,

see how much time we have.

Here, take these.

They'll help you and your hand.

I'll be right back.

[ Gunshots in distance ]

[ People shouting ]

[ Gunfire ]

[ Dog barking ]

[ Gunshots ]

The neighborhood

is fighting back.

We got a few minutes.

Get that hand fixed up,

get the f*** out of here.

[ Breathes shakily ]

[ Zipper opens ]

[ Zipper opens ]

Is it bad?

Is it bad?

Looks like we stopped

a lot of bleeding.

Ow, ow. Sh*t.

F***.

Oh, God.

You're such an a**hole.

That's what my wife says.

Your wife is a very smart lady.

Bet you can't wait

to see her and your kid.

What did you do in the military?

STUPE:

I was a hospital coroner.

LUCY:

Ow! Oh, my God!

Oh, my God.

STUPE:

A medic.

[ Crying ]

So you were a medic.

Now you're a janitor.

That's good.

STUPE:

Tired of watching people die.

[ Breathing shakily ]

[ Breathing heavily ]

Oh, God.

I feel weird.

I feel really weird.

Like...

I feel like my...

my insides are, like, floating.

It feels good. It feels...

I'm not complaining,

but it just...

I don't know what's going on.

I just...

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

What am I gonna do

when I get married?

Jose.

I guess it doesn't

really matter anymore, huh?

Why God gave you two hands,

right?

- [ Winces ]

- Got nine fingers left.

[ Groans ]

Do you believe in God?

I do.

I believe in God.

Thank you for helping me.

STUPE:

Who said I was helping you?

[ Knock on door ]

MAN:

Open the door.

[ Indistinct talking ]

- [ Knocking on door ]

- Oh!

- [ Knocking on door ]

- Is there another way out?

LUCY:

The basement.

[ Muffled pounding ]

- STUPE:
Lucy!

- [ Door breaks open ]

[ Radio chatter ]

[ Gunfire in distance ]

[ Explosion ]

[ Indistinct shouting ]

Oh, I feel really sick.

[ Radio chatter ]

My sister's house is that way.

We're gonna go that way.

No.

The soldiers went that way.

No. We're gonna go that way.

We're gonna get my sister.

Come on.

Let's go.

LUCY:

Well, I'm going.

Lucy!

F***!

Goddamn it.

[ Gunshots ]

[ Car alarm blaring ]

[ Door buzzing ]

F*** are you doing?

[ Buzzer continues ]

LUCY:

My sister lives here.

- Okay?

- [ Door buzzes ]

[ Gunshots ]

[ Knock on door ]

[ Mid-tempo music playing ]

- [ Knock on door ]

- Aah.

- Hey.

- Hi.

- Who the f*** is that guy?

- No, no, no.

- Who the f*** is that guy?

- Shut her up.

- Get the f*** out of my house.

- Shut her up.

- Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey.

- Lucy!

- Will you shut her up?

- No, no, no. Stop.

Calm down. Relax.

Listen to me.

- Get out!

- No, no, no. Listen to me.

Jose is dead, and this guy

saved me from these...

- He's a friend.

- What?

Are you on drugs?

Did he f***ing drug you?

- No.

- Motherf***er!

Hey, do you have any idea

what's going on right now?

What?

No. I've been asleep.

The f***ing neighbors have been

blasting "Call of Duty" all day,

and it just woke me up.

You haven't heard

any of these helicopters

or anything

that's been going on?

Lucy, there's always

helicopters.

This is Brooklyn. You've been

gone too long, college girl.

Listen, listen.

Sit down. Sit.

Okay. I want you

to pay attention to me.

Why are you being so serious?

I was thrown on the ground

and zip-tied by this soldier,

and then there was

these two guys

that followed me

into this basement.

And then this guy, he helped me.

He saved my life.

What?

This is...

This is...

This is too much.

My... My brain is gonna melt.

This is...

Lucy, this is too much.

I mean, Lucy, I think you're

just a little too high, man.

- But...

- No. I'm not on any...

I mean, I...

Well, I am on drugs.

I'm on drugs that he gave me

for my finger, but that's it.

[ Sighs ] All right.

I'm gonna...

I'm gonna go get

my sh*t together,

and then when I get back,

you and me and him,

we're getting out of here.

We're gonna get

somewhere safe, okay?

[ Stammering ]

What about Grandma?

She's gone.

No. What?

What?

- What?

- I didn't know what to do.

- BELINDA:
No.

- LUCY:
I'm sorry.

- [ Belinda crying ]

- Okay.

- I'll be right back.

- Lucy.

LUCY:

Hey, keep an eye on her for me.[ Door opens ]

[ Door closes ]

[ Footsteps depart ]

[ Bubbling ]

[ Coughing ]

[ Bubbling ]

[ Coughing ]

That was Oswaldo.

I left the little

latch thing open,

and he got out.

[ Clears throat ]

Yeah. They'll do that.

What are you...

Are you trying

to f*** my sister?

- [ Clears throat ]

- You're sisters?

Yeah. My grandma...

My grandma raised us,

so we're sisters.

So don't you try and f*** with

my sister or f*** my sister.

- I'm not trying to f*** her.

- Oh, yeah?

I'm just trying

to get through the day.

What are you taking pills for?

What's wrong with you?

I shot a guy.

I crushed a guy.

I got glass in my leg, hurts.

Needs help.

You, like, a soldier?

I'm a janitor.

A janitor?

Right.

- [ Bag zips ]

- I like soldiers.

- [ Stupe sighs ]

- [ Bag zips ]

Hey, what do you think?

It's a cat.

It's a happy p*ssy.

Meow.

- Meow.

- [ Bang ]

[ Clattering ]

What the f***?

Don't even f***ing

think about it.

[ Radio chatter ]

Why are you coming in here?

Are you alone?

[ Belinda screams ]

Don't come in my house!

[ Grunting ]

[ Shouting ]

Lucy, make sure no one

comes up through that window.

[ Breathing heavily ]

[ Groaning ]

STUPE:

You speak English?

- [ Grunts ]

- STUPE:
Hey.

- Where are you from?

- [ Spits ]

Kentucky, sir.

[ Grunting ]

You're an American?

What the f*** is going on?

Texas is seceding

from the United States.

Bullshit.

By the order of the fathers

of the New American Coalition.

We are a united force

with the goal of establishing

an independent nation,

free from government tyranny

and the right to live our lives

the true American way.

STUPE:
Yeah. That makes perfect

f***ing sense.

- Sir?

- LUCY:
Who's "we"?

Texas, Louisiana, Florida,

North Carolina,

South Carolina, West Virginia,

and Georgia are with us.

Parts of Maryland and

Pennsylvania are on the brink.

It's like a...

Like a new Civil War?

[ Man grunts ]

I served with... with good men

from those states.

Yeah. We're a private army.

Mercenaries?

What's the plan?

We'll force Congress

to ratify the secession.

Well, how are you gonna do that?

This... This is how we're

gonna do that, insurgency.

STUPE:
What's the plan here

in New York?

MAN:
We were just supposed to

lock down Bushwick,

round people up.

No one gets hurt.

Establish a green zone

for further operations

and wait for

the president to fold.

We, uh... We didn't anticipate

so much resistance from...

Resistance from

a designated soft spot.

And why the hell is that?

Ethno-diversity, sir.

[ Scoffs ]

Racist motherf***er.

I ain't racist.

It's fact.

This racist pig f***er thinks

that because there's so many

minorities here in Brooklyn

that we won't fight back?

Well, how's that

working out for you?

How?

How is that working out?

- Our intel told us...

- F*** your intel.

There weren't supposed to be

so many guns.

They're illegal here.

Welcome to New York,

stupid motherf***er.

Once we got blowback,

they gave us orders

to shoot on sight

if our lives were in danger.

LUCY:

Killing innocent Americans.

I'm just following orders.

I'm a soldier.

- What'd you say?

- I'm a soldier, sir.

You don't get to call yourself

a f***ing soldier.

You're not a soldier!

Sir, I'm sorry, sir.

Sir, please.

Please, I was just...

Just following orders.

Who's in charge?

Who's the f***ing a**hole

who sent you

and all your dumbass buddies

out here to get yourselves

killed for nothing?

No. Nothing.

It doesn't matter.

You're a mindless f***.

Why would you

question your orders?

You were in the military, right?

You understand.

- I can't be second-guessing...

- Shut up.

Where's the DMZ?

- Where's the goddamn DMZ?

- F*** you. I ain't telling you.

BELINDA:

I know where the DMV is.

The DMZ.

LUCY:

What's the DMZ?

It's a demilitarized zone.

It's where our troops

are embedded,

where they're

getting people out.

And you're gonna

f***ing tell me.

I'm tired of playing games

with you.

You have three f***ing seconds,

or I'm gonna blow

your goddamn head off.

- Please, sir.

- One, two...

MAN:

Grover Cleveland Park in Queens.

The U.S. Navy and Coast Guard

are evacuating

noncombatants from there,

the ones that make it.

STUPE:

The ones you don't kill first.

No one was supposed to

fight back, okay?

We had too many casualties.

They gave us orders.

They told us Bushwick was a

shoot-to-kill zone, us or them.

STUPE:
And we were just

supposed to f***ing take it?

Those were our orders.

It's not my fault.

F*** your orders.

- Sir...

- F*** you.

Sir, please...

[ Coughs ]

Cleveland Park.

Three or five blocks

at the most.

We don't have much daylight.

What do you want to do?

It's up to me now?

My leg's f***ed.

What do you want to do?

Okay.

We're getting out of here.

Is it safe to go out there?

Probably not,

but it's not safe in here.

Can I get a gun?

No.

What are we gonna do about him?

Ah!

- LUCY:
Let's go!

- Okay.

Just in case he comes back.

[ Helicopter blades whirring ]

[ Alarm blaring ]

[ Indistinct shouting,

gunshots ]

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

This is real.

[ Gunshots, explosion ]

I didn't know it was this bad.

[ Gunshots ]

[ Explosion, men shouting ]

[ Gunshots ]

I didn't know

those guys could fight.

STUPE:
Come on.

Let's go. Move.

[ Gunshots ]

If I died in my apartment

like a rat in a cage

Would the neighbors

smell the corpse

Before the cat ate my face?

Dead yet, p*ssy?

I'm trying to jettison

the ballast

With the hazardous waste

Sit your ass down.

Steep in a self-imposed

Stockholm and Lima in flux

Maybe an occupation popular

with demons and ducks

Made any mingling akin

to being seasoned and stuffed

STUPE:
F***! These streets

are crawling with soldiers.

- [ Gunshots ]

- Let's make a run for it.

Yo, we got to go upstairs.

[ Stupe shouting indistinctly ]

[ Door opens ]

STUPE:

Inside, go.

- Who the f*** are you?!

- [ Screams ]

- Put your f***ing guns down.

- Don't shoot.

- Put your f***ing guns down.

- Don't shoot.

Put the f***ing guns down.

Don't shoot.

We're just...

We're just...

[ Breathing heavily ]

We're just trying to stay alive.

Okay?

Put your f***ing guns down.

Okay.

Everybody relax.

Okay? Just relax.

Okay?

Chill.

Okay.

All right.

What the f*** are you

doing in our building?

You don't know what's

going on out there?

Look... if we can all just get

to Cleveland Park,

the U.S. Army is evacuating

people out of here.

- We can get out of here.

- That what you heard?

What does he mean?

What does that mean?

Whoa!

What the f***

is wrong with you, James?

JAMES:

Shut up, Ma.

Get your dumb asses

up here and sit down.

I said now!

Go! Hurry up.

Whoa.

[ Dogs barking ]

[ Mid-tempo music plays ]

The United States Army is set up

at a park over in Ridgewood,

helicopters, tanks,

whatever else.

Some people know better

than to stick around

in a war zone, James.

You don't remember the '70s.

Eventually, they gonna get us all out of here.

But we... Right now,

we can't get to them.

Coalition f***ers in the way.

- Ain't sh*t, Ma.

- Shut up, now, James.

My boys are tough,

but they ain't tough enough

to get through that blockade

by themselves.

STUPE:
Ma'am, we're not

gonna be enough to fight them.

I'm not talking about you.

Two blocks over, Church of God,

we heard they got 30, 40 people

all riled up and ready to go.

STUPE:

So what's the problem?

James, you want

to tell these nice folks

why we can't go and ask

Father John for help?

We got issues.

They need our help.

They got some people,

but they ain't got enough guns.

Well, it just so happens

that right here,

- down in this basement...

- Ma.

My boy and his little club...

- It's a gang.

- They got all kinds

of weapons...

Knives, guns, bullets...

For their little

dick-swinging gang bullshit.

Ma, they can't have our guns.

Oh, yes, they can.

This is what we gonna do.

James heads over there

and tells them we got they back,

he gets shot.

Me? I wouldn't make it

halfway down the block.

But...

this sweet little white girl,

she gonna go for us.

No.

You two are gonna stay here

for insurance.

- No.

- No. I'm...

You can't send her

out there alone.

I'm not doing that.

I go with her or no deal.

I don't recall

offering you a deal.

- I'm not going.

- Look. Look, ma'am.

You send her out there alone,

she's just gonna

get herself killed.

That's not gonna do

anybody any good, so just...

You let me go with her.

We'll figure it out, all right?

I'm not leaving my sister.

- Please?

- Lucy.

Please?

Your sister will be fine.

You and your bodyguard

go tell Father John

we'll meet him

at the Laundromat.

Tell him we're going there

right now.

You'll see your sister

in no time.

- No. No. No.

- No.

James, show these people

the front door.

- No. No. No!

- Let's go. Come on.

- Come on.

- No!

- Hurry up.

- Come on. God damn it.

- Lucy!

- Shut the f*** up.

- Sh*t!

- Get off me.

- [ Door slams ]

- Why are you doing this?

Don't f*** around.

Do what I tell you to do.

LUCY:

Don't you f***ing touch her.

STUPE:

Oh, this isn't right, man.

We're all from

the same neighborhood.

We got to stick together.

JAMES:
We're not from

the same neighborhood.

STUPE:

At least give us our guns, man.

Don't send us out there

without our guns.

JAMES:

Take your f***ing guns.

You better meet me

at the Laundromat.

LUCY:

Holy sh*t.

- [ Indistinct shouting ]

- It's getting worse.

[ Helicopter blades whirring,

indistinct shouting ]

How are we gonna

get Belinda back?

Are you okay?

Do you need help?

STUPE:

Can you walk?

Thank you for helping.

[ Door closes ]

STUPE:

Jesus.

LUCY:

Do you see him?

STUPE:
No.

He's got to be here somewhere.

LUCY:

Well, let's find him.

Have you seen Father John?

[ Hushed conversations ]

Take these over there

to that woman, all right?

I'll be right back.

STUPE:
Why don't you see

if you can find him?

I'm going to help out

around here.

[ Indistinct talking ]

[ Loud bang, people shouting ]

Um, excuse me.

Where is Father John?

Um, we've seen a few priests,

don't know their names.

[ Bang ]

Excuse me.

Are you Father John?

Who are you?

There's a group,

and they have a lot of weapons.

- And they sent me here...

- I'm not Father John.

He's praying downstairs.

Right through those doors.

Thank you.

Father John?

[ Indistinct praying ]

Hello?

Father John?

Hello?

FATHER JOHN:
Multitudes

in the valley of decision.

For the day of the Lord is near

in the valley of decision.

The sun and the moon grow dark.

LUCY:

Excuse me. Hi.

I'm looking for Father John.

I am Father John.

LUCY:

Oh, okay.

Are you hurt?

Are you okay?

We need to go to the Laundromat,

and there's a woman on

Starr Street with her son and...

Is anyone among you sick?

LUCY:
Sick?

No. Wait.

Let him call for the elders

of the church.

- LUCY:
I...

- And they will pray over him,

anointing him with oil

in the name of the Father

and of the Son

and of the Holy Ghost.

LUCY:
I don't know what

you're talking about.

We need your help.

We have to go.

You don't understand.

The prayer of faith

will save the one who is sick,

and the Lord will raise him up.

If he is guilty of sin,

he will be forgiven.

- [ Gunshot ]

- LUCY:
Oh, sh*t!

F***!

Oh, my God.

You stupid...

[ Breathing raggedly ]

Oh, my God.

Sh*t.

[ Exhales sharply ]

[ Breathing heavily ]

PRIEST:

Did you find Father John?

LUCY:

He's, um... He's gone.

PRIEST:

What do you mean, he's gone?

We have to go.

We have to go now.

PRIEST:
Father John wouldn't

leave this congregation.

- He's gone. We have to go.

- You didn't answer me.

Is Father John okay?

He did it to himself.

- [ Indistinct talking ]

- [ Sighs ]

Okay. Listen.

Listen up.

Um, it's not going to be safe

here for very much longer.

So we need to... we need to go.

Anybody who is able, please

help somebody who's injured.

We are going to all meet at the

Laundromat on Cypress Avenue,

where we will meet

a group of people

that have a lot of weapons,

and from there,

we are going to get

to the evacuation helicopters

inside Cleveland Park.

We need to stick together,

but we need to go now.

[ Indistinct conversations ]

[ Dramatic music plays ]

Stupe, come on.

Let's go.

- What happened to Father John?

- We have to go now.

- No. He's gone.

- I can't just leave him...

We have to go.

We have to go now.

- Just let me finish this.

- No.

Stupe, come on.

His shoulder is f***ed.

Jesus. Go. Go. Go.

Stupe.

STUPE:
Just give me two minutes.

God damn it.

I will meet you

by the front door. Come on.

Lucy! Sh*t.

Come on.

Let's go.

Are you okay?

Yeah. I'm okay.

Yes, yes. I can get up.

I'm okay.

[ Gunfire continues ]

Let's go.

Ouch.

Let's go.

Let's get the f*** out of here.

Come on. Go. Go. Move.

LUCY:

I just killed a guy with an ax.[ Helicopter blades whirring,

gunfire ]

[ Radio chatter ]

[ Indistinct conversations ]

Where is everybody?

STUPE:

I don't know.

Are we supposed to

meet them inside?

Are we supposed to

meet them outside?

We were just with everybody,

and where did they go?

How long do you think it's gonna

take for Belinda to get here?

I don't f***ing know!

Can you be patient

for one f***ing second?

I don't want to be here

any more than you do.

[ Siren wailing in distance ]

[ Explosion in distance ]

[ Gunshots in distance ]

[ Explosion, gunfire

in distance ]

So what year of college are you?

Second-year grad student.

What are you studying?

Civil engineering.

That's great.

That's great.

You'll be able to help

make a difference.

That's great.

[ Explosion in distance ]

How old's your kid?

You never told me.

When my wife and I

used to argue,

she'd get pretty

worked up at me.

And I'm so stubborn.

She'd get so frustrated,

and she'd...

she'd lose her temper with me.

And she'd say, "Stupe,

you're such a f***ing a**hole."

I can be.

But almost immediately,

she'd come over.

And she'd put her hands

on my face.

And she'd say,

"But you're my a**hole."

We were so in love.

And my son...

My son was so beautiful,

so smart.

I wish you could have seen him.

They're dead.

They were killed in

the World Trade Center attacks.

[ Breathes deeply ]

And I was so angry.

I was so full of hate.

I just wanted someone to pay.

So I enlisted

in the Marine Corps.

[ Sniffles ]

About a year and a half later,

they shipped me over to Iraq,

and I got my chance to fight.

I thought it would

make me feel better,

but it just made me feel worse.

I did a lot of things

I'm not real proud of.

So, uh...

[ Sniffles ]

I became a hospital corpsman.

'Cause I thought

if I saved lives, that would...

That would make me feel better,

but I just...

I lost more men than I saved.

And one day...

after months of nightmares

and not being able to keep

my goddamn hands from shaking,

I just stopped.

I just...

I couldn't bear to watch

one more f***ing person die.

So they sent me home

on a medical discharge,

and I just turned myself off.

For years, I just wanted

to be invisible.

[ Explosion in distance ]

And here I am again,

right in the middle of it,

right in the middle of all this

f***ing death and killing.

It's like it's being shoved

down my f***ing throat,

and it just goes on and on.

It just never stops,

and it's f***ing for what?

For what?

[ Explosion in distance,

electricity crackles ]

When my family died,

I died with them.

But we're gonna get out of here.

We're gonna get Belinda.

We're gonna get

the f*** out of here.

[ Breathes deeply ]

Thank you for telling me.

I'm sorry I lied to you.

I've just never really

been able to talk about it.

Why'd you tell me

you had to go to Hoboken?

[ Chuckles ]

[ Sniffles ]

I thought if I told you

I was going to Hoboken,

no f***ing way

you'd try to follow me.

- [ Laughs ]

- [ Chuckles ]

Who the f*** wants

to go to Hoboken?

- You.

- [ Both laugh ]

I got to take a piss.

[ Sniffles ]

[ Gunshot ]

[ Thud ]

Stupe!

- What the f*** did you do?

- I'm so sorry.

[ Crying ]

He came at me, and I...

[ Crying ]

LUCY:
Get the f*** out!

Get the f*** out!

Oh, my God.

[ Crying ]

Oh, my God.

Stupe.

Stupe. Stupe.

Wake up. Wake up.

Oh, my God.

No, no, no, no, no.

F***.

I don't know...

I don't know what to do.

Just tell me what to do,

and I'll do it.

I'll just...

Let me help you.

[ Crying ] Let me...

I don't...

Damn it.

[ Crying ]

I'm so sorry.

What am I gonna do?

F***.

Sorry.

BELINDA:
Lucy!

Lucy.

Oh, yes!

LUCY:
Ohh.

I thought I lost you, too.

Are you okay?

What happened?

Did they do...

Hey, hey.

Get the f*** away

from my sister.

We did exactly what you asked.

Now get the f*** away from...

Hey, hey. Calm the f*** down.

The fight's outside.

You did your thing

with the church group,

and we got your sister here.

- You okay?

- Lucy, I'm really okay.

It's really bad outside.

We all just want

to get out of here.

Where's the big guy?

Look. You guys can stand

around talking about nothing,

but we're getting

the f*** out of here.

- Just give me a minute.

- Wait.

JAMES:
You're wasting time.

We're leaving.

LUCY:

Come on!

Lucy, what are you doing?

F*** me.

Really?

He's dead?

That's some sh*t.

We got to get out of here.

[ Gunshots in distance ]

Whoa.

We're going.

- Come on.

- Okay, okay, okay.

LUCY:

Stay close to me.

[ Indistinct shouting ]

BELINDA:

I'm so scared.

I told you it was

f***ed up out here.

LUCY:

Stay close to me.

BELINDA:

Okay, okay, okay. I'm here.

There's so many people.

You can't even see anything.

LUCY:

Let's get behind this.

BELINDA:

We're stuck.

We're not going to be

able to get through.

- No, no, no.

- Lucy, let's go.

They have a plan. We just have

to get to those helicopters.

Where are they?

LUCY:

They're right over there.

[ Gunshots ]

- Stay near me.

- BELINDA:
Okay.

[ Horn blares ]

[ Crowd cheering ]

[ Horn blaring ]

Whoa!

LUCY:

Okay. Let's go.

[ Gunshots ]

[ Indistinct shouting ]

Don't lose me.

Oh, sh*t.

[ Gunfire ]

- Belinda, wait.

- Got you, b*tch.

Get the f*** off me.

[ Gunshot ]

Come on. Come on. Get up.

We got to move.

[ Gunfire ]

LUCY:

Belinda?

[ Shouting ]

LUCY:

This way.

[ Gunfire ]

Okay.

You're good.

You're good. You're good.

Okay.

This way. This way.

This way.

- The gun's out.

- Drop it, drop it.

[ Men grunting, gunfire ]

Take his gun.

Take his gun.

Come on.

- Aah!

Help me. Help me.

Help me.

Yeah? Okay.

Gonna get behind those barrels.

Ready? Okay. Run.

- Run!

- [ Grunts ]

[ Gunfire ]

You okay?

We have to make it

through there.

What?

No. F***.

We're not gonna make it.

Okay. We're gonna pull these.

Are you ready?

We're gonna pull these.

One, two, three.

We're almost in. The helicopters

I see the helicopter.

[ Men grunting ]

Come on.

We're so close.

Flea comb, exorcism,

and deworming

Fitted for a curse

and a crown of birds circling

Search party falling forward

unthwarted

Meet him at the crossroads,

drawn and quartered

For a master of puppets,

how sad are his cupboards

Non-dairy creamers,

can of last supper

And a runneth-over cup

full of black tap water

It's a marvel of privacy

over pack hunter

Raspberry jelly

on his Jesus toast

And turn heather gray sweats

into Easter clothes

With no immediately measurable

crime-wave ice age

Christ children

still skin a cat sideways

I don't pick teams

or administer bans

I'm in the creek with a pick

and pan, it go

Forcibly ejected

or a voluntary death scene

Tell 'em what the out-of-order

blinking EMF mean

Ghost
