Pre-title sequence:
A glacial ice cover stretches for miles. The last frontier  on earth is a harsh land of snow and ice. WE MOVE CLOSER: 
Creeping slowly over a graveyard of skeletal remains. Bones and shards of bones protrude from the snow like small flags. And beyond those bones lies blood, darkly rich in color, soaking deep into the once pristine snow. This is fresh blood.  
A BARN or a structure resembling a barn lives on the edge of the sea covered in snow and surrounded by enormous tabular icebergs. This structure has been bruised by the hands of time, the weight of endless falling snow that gathers on its roof and the wicked wind of this, the coldest place on earth.  SMOKE pours from a chimney.

EXT. whaling station STREET - DAY
The "barn" building is surrounded by two smaller buildings on a narrow street in this tiny shack of a town. Smoke rises from boiling kettle drums, a steam engine drives a small conveyor belt endlessly round. There is no sign of human life. Suddenly from nowhere, KARL, a tough, bearded, strapping whaler, appears. He's out of breath as if something has been chasing him but we don't see anything except the terror on his face. He's dressed in a t-shirt and jeans and is freezing to death. His hands and arms resemble frozen sausages. They are wickedly frostbitten. The veins on his arms look like long, thin rivers. His face is a deep rich frosted blue.
KARL starts to edge down the main street, sensing that something may be watching him. He passes a smaller shack, through the window a copy of H.G. Wells' War Of The Worlds can be seen lying on a desk next to a flickering oil lamp. He hears something. Stops. He looks over to the greenhouse building. He moves towards it. He looks in horror as he sees a BLOODY HANDPRINT, frozen on a shattered window pane.
Panicking he runs down a side passage between two larger buildings. He stops not daring to go forward. He slowly starts to back down the alley, until his feet trip across a wooden sledge. KARL falls to the ground amongst the empty dog harnesses. He senses something under the closest building, and peers into the darkness. A movement and then suddenly a sled dog jumps out from the gloom, barking fiercely. The dog is tied to a post. He hastily gets up and backs up into the mess hall.     
there is no scene number 3.
iNT. WHALING STATION MESS HALL - DAY
Karl enters the mess hall, slamming the door shut behind him. He looks up to see, swinging from hooks, HARPOONS, LANCES and LOUCHETS. Exhausted. Freezing. He peers into the room. Oil lamps flicker throwing shadows across the walls. Pans boil on the stove, overflowing and spitting. A forgotten kettle steams, ready to whistle. The place is empty. Then unexpectedly a shadow moves and an ALIEN tail flicks across screen. Karl does not notice.
He moves deeper into the mess hall. Forty bowls and drinking jugs sit on the long empty tables prepared for a crew of forty men that are nowhere to be seen.  
KARL'S eyes do a scan of the entire room but nothing is there. A blur passes in front of camera distorting the outline of KARL.  Slowly he turns around to find himself staring at something we don't see. He looks up in horror. He backs up, falling over a table bench.  He's on the ground. We hear a sharp metallic sound. In the foreground PREDATOR BLADES now hellishly frame KARL as he scurries back. He can go no further.  He's helpless.  The SHADOW OF A PREDATOR spreads over Karl's terrified face. Three LASER DOTS scan across KARL, passing over his face.   
In PREDATOR VISION we see KARL, he is frozen with fear. But then the image reforms and scans an area over KARL'S shoulder. There is nothing there. The image rescans and we reveal AN ALIEN: Seen only in the snap of a few frames, nearly subliminal imagery. The TWIN MOUTHS open and prepare to strike.  The Alien lunges towards the PREDATOR.
TWIN BLADES on the Predator's wrist come scything down. Their razor-sharp edges catching the light. Straight toward the Alien, but also STRAIGHT TOWARD CAMERA.
SMASH CUT TO:

CUT TO BLACK:
LEGEND:  PRESENT DAY
Dark void. For a moment, everything is totally black.  Then light begins to creep onto the SCREEN.  It slowly illuminates what seem to be giant black spider legs.  They are almost metallic in appearance.  For a moment, any fan would be forgiven in thinking that this was an ALIEN QUEEN.  
But as the light grows, we see that the legs belong to an orbiting SATELLITE.  We are in space.  50 miles above an unidentified planet.  As the Sun rises above the planet, it illuminates the globe, and we begin to see the familiar green and blue of -- EARTH.
Suddenly THE CAMERA races forward - INTO the satellite.  We streak through a complex web of circuitry, coming to rest at last by a large glass LENS.  The satellite is one giant camera aimed towards the Earth.  And it's taking photographs.  
We see the imagery, but very distorted.  Something on the surface of the Earth far below -- A PATTERN OF INTERLOCKING SQUARE SHAPES.
EXT. new mexico - present Day.
The vast desert plains are broken by a forest of radio dishes pointed toward the heavens.

Inside, the WHIR of AIR CONDITIONING.  The distinctive logo of WEYLAND INDUSTRIES is everywhere.  A handful of bored TECHNICIANS and SCIENTISTS monitor the data from dozens of satellites orbiting the Earth.  We get the feeling nothing ever happens here.  A TECHNICIAN watching an old movie ("FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE WOLFMAN") on a portable TV finally notices a flashing light on the console behind him.
Technician
Hey. Take a look at this. 
His SUPERVISOR walks over.  Not expecting much.
Supervisor
What is it?
Technician
It's the data stream from PS12.
SUPERVISOR
Big Bird. Where is she?
TECHNICIAN
Right above Sector 14.
SUPERVISOR
There isn't anything in Sector 14.
TECHNICIAN
There is now.
The supervisor pulls a hard copy from the printer.  It shows the pattern of interlocking square shapes.
SUPERVISOR
Wake them up.

Everybody.
EXT. khumba ice waterfall - MOUNT EVEREST - DAY
EXTREME CLOSE UP: A Grivel Rambos ICE AXE slams into the frozen waterfall, biting into the ice.   
EXTREME CLOSE UP: FACE OF ALEXA WOODS 
dressed head to toe in extreme cold weather gear, face mask, and boots with crampons (spiked metal devices strapped to the bottom of boot).  
Legend: Nepal
WIDE: Lex is climbing the Khumba ice waterfall, a four thousand foot frozen waterfall that begins eighteen thousand feet in the air and crests at twenty-two thousand feet.  
Lex has nearly reached the top, her mind focused on a specific rhythm and routine.  Swing the axe, kick the crampon, pull and move up. Again. Calm, deliberate, always careful to keep her balance.  Swing the axe, kick the crampon, pull and move up. Again. She is meticulous in every step. 
Lex anchors her safety line by screwing an ice screw into the face of the waterfall.  Grains of snow fall over her face as the screw is driven in.  Water trickles deep within the ice.
Lex relaxes for a second as the carabiner snaps shut and secures her to the anchor.  Hard wind blows over.  Other than that sound, everything is quiet on the ice climb.  
She catches her breath and starts again. Swing the axe, kick the crampon, pull and move up.  Again. And again.  And again.  She stops.  Right at the edge of the top. She takes a minute to look at the world from here -- Her moment of peace is shattered by modern communication. Her GSM phone RINGS.  She's clearly surprised that anyone should be calling.  
Lex checks the number, doesn't recognize it, but the phone won't stop ringing.  She takes an earpiece and carefully slides it into her ear.  
LEX 
Who is this?
The voice on the other end is liquid velvet cut with a crystal clear English accent.
MAX
Miss Woods ... a pleasure to make your acquaintance.  My name is Maxwell Stafford.  
(beat)
I represent Weyland Industries.
(NB: SCENE 7 CONTINUES ON PAGE 5)
LEX
Let me guess: you're suing us again? 
MAX
You misunderstand ... I speak for Mr. Weyland himself.  
LEX
What's one of the world's biggest polluters want with us?  
Max 
Mr. Weyland's interest is in you personally.  He's offering to fund the foundation with which you are associated for a full year ... if you'll meet with him. 
Lex hesitates for a moment.  This is like making a deal with the Devil.
LEX
When?
MAX
Tomorrow.   
LEX
I presume you know how bad we need the money ... 
Lex hesitates again.
LEX (CONT'D)
... But tomorrow's going to be a problem.
Earpiece in, Lex continues climbing the last few feet.  
lEX (CONT'D)
Take me a week to get back to the World.
MAX
I told Mr. Weyland that.
Lex swings the axe, kicks the crampon, pulls and moves up.
LEX
What did he say?
Annoyed, Lex pulls herself up and over the ridge.  
MAX
He said he didn't have a week.
And Lex stands up, unhooks her safety lines and finds herself staring at a perfect pair of Qxford Brogues, belonging to MAXWELL STAFFORD, an elegant man of Afro-Caribbean descent. 
A Bell 212 Helicopter sits behind him.  All waiting for her arrival. She's speechless.

EXT. Teotihuacan, mexico - Day   
Thirty miles northeast of Mexico City. 107 degrees in the shade. A GROUP OF WORKERS runs through an archaeological site.  Behind them, in the near distance, looms the timeless beauty of the TEOTIHUACAN PYRAMIDS.
worKERS
(in Spanish)
He's found it!  He's found it!
WORKERS begin running toward--
EXT. excavation site - DaY
SEBASTIAN DE ROSA, the boy who turned his childhood love of exploring the woods behind his house into a lifelong obsession with archaeology, wipes sweat from his brow as he studies a computer printout that shows something buried just beneath the surface. THOMAS, Sebastian's right hand, turns on a small DIGITAL VIDEO CAMERA. 
ThOMAS
It's too small to be the chamber.
Thomas starts to record the discovery.
SEBASTIAN
It's a burial offering. 
ARCHEOLOGISTS and WORKERS speaking overlapping Spanish, English and French gather around the excavation site, forming a LARGE CROWD. Sebastian takes note of the crowd's excitement, it's almost as great as his own.
SeBASTIAN (CONT'D)
(to the crowd)
The Teotihuacans would bury a hundred or so gifts around the burial chamber. Obsidian blades, pyrite mirrors, shells. We must be right on top of it. 
The tension is unbearable as Sebastian slowly begins to  reach into the darkness of the trench, his arm slowly disappearing into the void. Then going further.  
Slowly, Sebastian begins to lift something from the hole.  We see the reaction on Sebastian's face, but not the artifact. Thomas is recording everything.
thoMAS
Professor?
(NB: SCENE 11 CONTINUES ON PAGE 7)
Sebastian turns slowly to show the crowd what he has uncovered.  It's a faded red and blue metal object. A BENT CAP FROM A PEPSI BOTTLE. The disappointment in the crowd is palpable. Sebastian is crushed.
Juan Ramirez (o.s.)
Nineteen fifties I'd say. 
Sebastian looks over to see JUAN RAMIREZ, an official with the Department of Interior.
Juan Ramirez (CONT'D)
According to you, the Teotihuacans' final gift to their dead king was a... Pepsi.
seBASTIAN
Give me one more month.
Juan Ramirez
Can't do it, Sebastian.  Department of Interior needed results six months ago.  We're bringing in another team.
EXT. SEBASTIAN'S CAMP - daY
Sebastian is packing at his tent. Thomas walks up behind him.
seBASTIAN
How bad?
thOMAS
We lost half the crew.
sEBASTIAN
Bobby leave?
THOMAS
(nods)
Yeah. And Joe. And Caroline. Nick, Jerry and Jerry's crew.
Sebastian takes the news hard.
SEBASTIAN
Thomas, the burial chamber is here. I know it. We're going to find it.
THOMAS
I know it too. But without a crew and a new permit we're out of business. 
SEBASTIAN
Hold the rest of the team together for two days. I'll go to Mexico City...talk to the bank.
I'll get us more money. 
max (o.s.)
I might be able to help you accomplish that, Professor.
Sebastian and Thomas turn to find MAXWELL, an elegant man of Afro-Caribbean descent, standing by his tent.   
SeBASTIAN
Do I know you?
max 
In exchange for a little of your time.
And Max hands him an envelope with a Weyland Industries seal.

INT. Bell 212
Lex is asleep.  On her chest folded open is an issue of "Scientific American" magazine.  It features a picture of Weyland and the title: "CHARLES BISHOP WEYLAND, PIONEER OF MODERN ROBOTICS." 
Staring out the window one seat over is Chemical Engineer GRAHAM MILLER (glasses, lifelong, card-carrying science geek). He stands up and attempts to take a picture of himself.  First attempt he blinds himself.  Second attempt the chopper bumps and he's knocked into Lex. She wakes up.  
MiLLER
Sorry.
She nods, starts to go back to sleep.
miLLER (CONT'D)
But since you're awake, 
would you mind?
He hands her his digital camera. She snaps the picture.
MILLER (CONT'D)
Documenting the trip for my boys so they know that their father wasn't always boring.  
Miller shows Lex a picture of his sons on his camera.   
MILLER (CONT'D)
That's Jacob.  And that's Scotty. 
LeX
They're cute. Is this your wife?
MILLER
(extending hand)
Ex-wife. Graham Miller, chemical engineer.
LEX 
(doing likewise)
Alexa Woods, environmental technician and guide.
MILLER
Do you work for Weyland? 
LEX
No. I split my time between working for a small environmental group and taking scientists on expeditions on the ice. One pays for the other and neither pays very well.
MILLER
The ice?
LEX
Antarctica.  
co-piLOT
Lex, you and your friend buckle up. We're going to hit some turbulence. 
mILLER
Friend of yours?  
LEX
...of my dad's. He trained most of the pilots down here.  During the summer, my sister and I tagged along.  
mILLER
Does she work with you?
LEX
No. She hates the cold, moved to Florida. If you see her skiing, she's being pulled by a boat. 
The CO-PILOT turns and hollers from the cockpit.
Co-pilot
JUST PASSED THE PSR!
MILLER
Damn, I wanted a picture.  
LEX
Of what?
MILLER
The PSR. They should really call it out before you pass it. 
LEX
The PSR is the point of safe return.  It means we've used more than half our fuel so we can't turn back.  
MILLER
But we could still land?  I mean if something went wrong...?
Wicked turbulence starts to shake violently.
LEX
We could ditch 
(Miller looks relieved)
--but the temperature of the water would kill us in three minutes. 
Miller goes pale as the chopper continues to shake.
MILLER
Antarctica.

INT. PIPER MARU - hOLD number one
Surrounded by THERMAL DIGGING EQUIPMENT, three separate TEAMS are assembled in the briefing area. Team 1: (The scientists) Lex, Sebastian, Thomas, (Sebastian's right hand from Mexico) and Miller.  Team 2: (the muscle) Max and Weyland, security personnel ADELE ROUSSEAU (sexy, tough and toned); VERHEIDEN a soldier of fortune that has fought in hotspots all over the world and earned a prominent scar down his face as a souvenir; CONNORS (bearded outdoorsman who looks like a chiseled version of the Unabomber) and KLAUS (a big Dane built like a Viking.)  Team 3: (the drillers) lead by QUINN, (a muscular Texan and third generation driller) and roughnecks SVEN, BORIS and MIKKEL.  
Standing between Boris and Sven, Miller looks like a thread of dental floss. Miller, excitedly bouncing around the room like a human pinball, jumps inside the cab of one of Quinn's large drilling machines. He begins to press buttons like a kid. 
vERHEIDEN
Having fun?
miLLER
First real adventure. Can't wait to  tell my kids about all this.
VERHEIDEN
This might be an adventure for you, "dad" but for the rest of us, it's a job.  Get off the equipment and go back to the suburbs before you walk us all off a cliff.
Lex approaches.  Miller doesn't want to back down so easily in front of her.  He holds his ground.
verheiden (CONT'D)
Get off or you'll be wearing your ass for a hat.
Miller moves. He regains his composure.
lEX
Nice team spirit.
Verheiden looks at his men -- can you believe this guy?
verheiden 
(to Max)
Keep the beakers away from the gear.
MILLER 
(to Lex)
What's a beaker?
(NB: SCENE 17 CONTINUES ON PAGE 12)
leX
It's what they call scientists out here. You know...beaker? Like in the Muppet Show.
MILLER
Beaker... I kinda like that.
Thomas approaches Sebastian, sitting down.
THOMAS
Weyland's cheque cleared.
SEBASTIAN
Good. We're going to listen to whatever he has to say. We nod, we smile and then we politely decline whatever offer he makes, take the money and head back to Mexico.
Max looks around the room to make sure everyone is here.
max 
Welcome aboard everybody!  Please.  You probably wonder why this elite team of experts was assembled here?  Your host will give you the answer now.
The room falls quiet.  
MAX (CONT'D)
Mr. Weyland.
A MAN emerges from the shadows behind Max - CHARLES BISHOP  WEYLAND. Weyland, in his forties, looks more like a big game hunter than the billionaire that he is.  
An ASSISTANT hands A TABLET PC to everyone in the room as Weyland nods to Max to fire up a digital projector, illuminating a large square of the peeling metal wall behind Weyland. 
WEYLAND
Thank you all for coming. Seven days ago one of my satellites over Antarctica was hunting for mineral deposits when a sudden heat bloom beneath the earth outlined this...
An image comes up on the wall behind Weyland.  We've seen it before.  A PATTERN OF INTERLOCKING SQUARE SHAPES. An intense ripple of excitement spreads through the room. 
weYLAND (CONT'D)
The red lines indicate solid walls. Through thermal mapping we've generated a rough three dimensional image of the structure.  It's massive ... Containing hundreds of rooms, all built around a central core.  My experts tell me it's a pyramid.  What they can't agree on is who built it and when.  
THOMAS
What caused the heat bloom?
WEYLAND
We don't know.  
Sebastian clicks past the photographs on his tablet PC.
(NB: SCENE 17. CONTINUES ON PAGE 13) 
WEYLAND (CONT'D)
(snaps slide)
One expert tells me that this feature is reminiscent of the Aztecs.
(snaps slide)
Another tells me that this is probably Cambodian.
(snaps slide)
But everyone agrees that the smooth side is definitively Egyptian. 
miLLER
Why would anyone build a pyramid out here?
Thomas
Ancient maps show Antarctica free of ice.  It's likely that the continent was once habitable.
MAX
Mr. De Rosa?
Sebastian steps closer to the wall, examining the pictures and comparing them with the pictures on his tablet PC.
seBASTIAN
I think your experts are right.
WEYLAND
Which one?
SEBASTIAN
All of them. The Egyptians, the Cambodians and the Aztecs all built pyramids.  Three separate cultures that lived thousands of miles apart -
THOMAS
- with no communication between them.  
SEBASTIAN
Yet what they built was almost identical.
LEX
Meaning what exactly?
SEBASTIAN 
This might be the first pyramid ever built.
miLLER
Built by whom?
Sebastian can barely contain his excitement.
seBASTIAN 
The master culture from which all others are derived. 
Everyone in the room is stunned.
weYLAND
If it could be the first pyramid, it could also be the last.
An amalgam of the ones that came before it. There's no proof of any connection between the cultures.
SEBASTIAN
This photo is the proof.
WEYLAND
Thank you.
miLLER
(interjecting)
Um...I can't tell you who built it but if I could take a sample from it, I could tell you how old it is.  
max
Within how many years, Professor? 
MILLER
Actually, it's Doctor.  And I'll give you the exact year.
weYLAND
Well Doctor Miller, I'm offering to put you right next to this thing.
LEX
Where exactly on the ice is this?
WEYLAND
Bouvetoya Island. But it's not on the ice. It's two thousand feet under it.  
(next picture)
Directly below this abandoned whaling station which will serve as our base camp.
MAX
Mr. Quinn.
QUINN steps forward from his men. It's clear that Quinn and his men are a tight group that keep to themselves.
Quinn 
Mr. Stafford, you're looking at the best drilling team in the world. We'll chew to that depth in seven days.
Sven, Boris and Mikkel nod in agreement.
lEX
And add three weeks on top of that to train everyone here.  
weyLAND
We don't have that kind of time.  I'm not the only one with a satellite over Antarctica.  Others will be here soon.
leX 
Maybe I wasn't clear.  No one in this room is ready for this trip.
WEYLAND
That's why I invited you here.
lEX
Bouvetoya is one of the most isolated places in the world.  The nearest land is a thousand miles away. There's no help if we run into trouble. 
WEYLAND
You're right, it's a no man's land. But the train has left the station. I think I speak for everyone aboard this ship -- 
(points to amazing imagery of pyramid)
This is worth the risk. 
Lex looks around as a CHORUS OF EXCITEMENT is heard. Their minds are made up.  She turns to Weyland.

weYLAND
Called them. 
LEX
And?
Max walks past her and into the room.
max
(interrupts)
They gave the same bullshit answer that you did.
lEX
Mister Weyland, what I told you in there wasn't bullshit. If you rush this, people will get hurt, maybe die.
weYLAND
Ms. Woods, I don't understand your objections. We're not asking you to take us up Everest. We need you to take us from the ship to the pyramid and then back to the ship. That's it.
LEX
What about inside the pyramid?
WEYLAND
You don't have to worry about that.  Once we're at the site we have the best equipment, technology and experts  that money can buy. 
LEX
Mister Weyland, when I lead a team I don't ever leave my team. 
weYLAND
I admire your passion. I wish you were coming with us.

A powerful X-class flare erupts from the sky, accompanied by a halo coronal mass ejection.
millER (O.S.)

It's in the upper atmosphere.  Streams of protons and electrons from the sun are deflected by the earth's magnetic field causing a  solar radiation storm.
Lex turns to see Sebastian and Miller. They join her on the deck, one on each side of her. Miller has his camera out.
seBASTIAN
It's beautiful. Even the way you describe it, professor.
(NB: SCENE 20 CONTINUES ON PAGE 18)
MILLER
Actually, it's Doctor.
(to Lex)
And I agree.
Lex looks up at the sky and is reflective.
LeX
Shackleton called Antarctica the 'last great journey left to man.' It's the one place left in the world that no one owns, that's completely free.
(a beat; a smile)
Me? I'm sort of partial to the penguins.
miLLER
I wish you'd reconsider coming with us?
She looks at him. Smiles.  But shakes her head. Miller leans in, pretends to share a secret.
miLLER (CONT'D)
Not for me. Obviously. But I think a lot of the other guys really need you. 
(off Lex's look)
C'mon, don't make me pull out pictures of my kids again. 
lEX
Your kids aren't that cute.
SebASTIAN
What if we got pictures of other people's kids?  Would that do it?
Lex smiles. Miller's humor and Sebastian's charm is a tough combination. 
LEX
Want my advice? Stay on the boat.
seBASTIAN
We're not staying on the boat.   
LEX
Guys, the first rule of this job is to not take people to places they're not ready to go. 
SEBASTIAN
Listen, I was on the next plane to Mexico. My team's waiting. But if Weyland's even half right, this could change history. 
LEX
Weyland is more concerned with making another billion than with anything else. Including your safety. 
SEBASTIAN 
Let me ask you something. You're here. You know this place. Do we stand a better chance of surviving with you than with the number two choice?
From Lex's look, it's clear that they do.
seBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Because if we do and you don't go, and something goes wrong, are you going to be able to live with that?
Rousseau (O.S.)
Ms. Woods.
Lex turns to see Rousseau standing there.
Rousseau (CONT'D)
Your helicopter's refueled.  They're waiting for you. 
We hold on Lex, still undecided.

INT. pREDATOR SPACECRAFT - armory.
The CAMERA cruises through the spaceship, discovering three Predator helmets arranged around a computer monitor.  The design is distinctly techno-medieval.  Suddenly a HOLOGRAM above the computer flickers into life.  Icons and language are all Predator, but the imagery it shows is recognizable - it's the Pyramid.  
A Predator targeting system activates, drawing a line between the pyramid and the surface of the ice.  
The spaceship shoots a beam of searing hot plasma down towards Antarctica.  
EXT. the pack ice - perpetual twilight
The ship is at a standstill.  The pack ice has already begun to reform, creating a solid sheet around the ship's hull. 
Quinn and his Roughnecks are hoisting the drilling platforms out of the hold and lowering them to the ice. 
int. pIPER MARU - hold
A dozen shivering SCIENTISTS are gathered around, waiting for something. Sebastian and Miller are part of the audience, as are Thomas, Rousseau and Verheiden. The moon hangs low in the sky.  Its dull blue glow provides what little illumination there is.  It's freezing cold because the doors of the hold are open.
quinN
Move these Haaglunds out.
In the background, the Haaglunds are being unloaded as Quinn and the rest of his team continue to unload the rest of their equipment.
Lex steps forward to address the scientists.
miLLER 
I told you she'd stay.  It's my animal magnetism.  It's irresistible.  
Thomas takes out his digital video camera and begins to record the briefing. Lex speaks in a simple, low key, matter of fact tone. Behind her are ice axes, tents, stoves, harnesses, ropes, thermarests, neoprene water bottles and first aid kits.
LEX
Everybody. Gather round. 
It's my job to keep you alive on this expedition and I need your help to do that. Since I don't have the time to properly train you, I'm laying down three simple rules.  
Rousseau hands out walkie-talkies.
LEX (CONT'D)
One: No one goes anywhere alone. Ever.  Two: Everyone will maintain constant communication. Three: Unexpected things will happen. When they do -- no one tries to be a hero. 
miLLER
For some of us it just comes naturally.
Lex smiles.  A few small LAUGHS.
vERHEIDEN
Laugh it up, beaker.  You get scars like this when some "hero" on your team screws up their assignment.
Miller looks at Verheiden.  No more jokes around him.
LEX

If one of us goes down.  We're all going after them.

Understood.
Lex breaks the meeting. She walks over to Rousseau who has started to clean her automatic handgun.
LEX
Seven seasons on the ice and I've never seen a gun save someone's life. 
Rousseau
I don't plan on using it.
LEX
Then why bring it?  
Rousseau
Same principle as a condom. I'd rather have one and not need it, then need it and not have one.    
I'm Adele.

I'm glad that you decided to stay. 
LEX
Couldn't let you have all the fun.  
It's immediately clear that they like and respect each other.

SCENE 28A. HAS BEEN DELETED.
EXT. pACK ICE - wasteland - perpetual twilight
Five tracked vehicles churn their way across the pristine snow.  The two drilling platforms and three assorted cargo and people transporters.  Their headlights illuminate the threatening, unearthly landscape.  The convoy has already left the Piper Maru far behind and has almost reached the whaling station.
int. haAGLUND - perPETUAL TWILIGHT
Sebastian and Lex are riding inside.  They share a look.  Sebastian is fiddling with a necklace that he made out of the Pepsi cap he found in Mexico.
LEX
What's with the bottle cap?
SEBASTIAN
Valuable archaeological find.
LEX
I can see that.
She smiles.  Sebastian is looking outside up at the moon.
SEBASTIAN 
When I was a kid, growing up in Sicily, you know what they'd call a moon that big?
Lex looks at him, then shakes her head.
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
(in Italian)
'Hunter's Moon'

EXT. razorback point - PERPETUAL TWILIGHT
The lead Haaglund tops a snow rise and halts.  One by one the others follow suit.  Weyland disembarks, followed by the others.  Around them, the snow is falling, slow and steady.
QUINN
(re the Haaglunds)
Take those over a little further!  Connors!  Hold it guys .... Keep the engines running!
thomas
Hi.
Rousseau says nothing and keeps smoking.
thomas (CONT'D)
Be honest. You're a little disappointed that you didn't get the yellow jacket, aren't you?
rousseau
They give the newbies the yellow jackets so that when you fall down a crevice and die, it's easier for us to spot your body.
Thomas nods and moves off.  Lovely girl.  
Lex fires a parachute flare into the air. It explodes in the air and brightly illuminates the Whaling Station in a cool green hue.
LEX
It's an abandoned whaling station.  According to your satellite imagery Mr. Weyland, the pyramid is located directly beneath it.
EXT. rAZORBACK POINT-whaling station-perpetual twilight
A dozen wooden buildings we recognize from the 1904 massacre we witnessed earlier.  Some of them no more than shacks.  All of them encrusted with ice and half buried in the snow. The team walk down "Main Street," illuminating the bizarre ghost town with their flashlights.  It's creepy as hell. 
MAX
Spread out.  We'll use this place as base camp.
(turns to Quinn)
Mr. Quinn. Begin drilling operations as soon as possible.
QUINN
I'm on it.
EXT. rAZORBACK POINT - harbor - perpetual twilight
A giant black cauldron dominates the harbor.  Fifteen feet high, thirty feet across.  One of its four feet has been knocked away and it tilts over at a crazy angle.  Only the fact that it is frozen solid stops it from tumbling into the harbor below.
SeBASTIAN
(re whalebones)
What are these?
LEX
Whalebones ... This station was abandoned in 1904.  Everyone just disappeared overnight.  It was a big mystery back then.
SEBASTIAN
Witch's cauldron?
LEX
The 'Separator.'  Throw whale blubber in, heat it, separate out the fat.  Whale oil was big business back then.
(NB: SCENE 34. CONTINUES ON PAGE 24)
The harbor leading to the whaling station is totally frozen over.  Sebastian stares down at the thick ice.
SEBASTIAN
How did they get ships in here?
LEX
The station only operated in the summer, when the pack ice melted. It was abandoned in 1904.
SEBASTIAN
How come?
LEX
Nothing left to hunt I guess.
INT. whaling station - meSS HALl
Miller enters the frozen mess hall -- the same frozen mess hall that Karl tried to flee from a hundred years ago.  It's an eerie sight. Like some kind of frozen doll house. The tables are covered with sheet ice.  Cups, plates, spoons and forks are frozen to the spot they were left since 1904. Miller tries to pick up one of the cups but the handle breaks off into his hand.
MILLER
One for National Geographic. 
He takes out a camera, sets the timer.  He rushes over to get in place but he's too slow and FLASH!  The camera takes a picture of his back.  The bold flash of light momentarily illuminates the mess hall.  And this blast of light has disturbed something. There's MOVEMENT.
MILLER (CONT'D)
Hello!
The movement STOPS.  And now Miller knows he's not alone.
MILLER (CONT'D)
Hello!
Miller's VOICE ECHOES around the mess hall. There is no reply. Miller turns, ready to go. Then the SOUND stirs again. Moving. SCUTTLING across the floor. The sound of an ALIEN FACE HUGGER getting closer?  Sheepish, Miller recalls the toughest words he's ever heard. 
MILLER (CONT'D)
(a'la Verheiden)
Come out of there or... you'll be wearing your ass for a hat.
The movement STOPS.  Miller swallows hard.  He's a chemical engineer after all -- easy prey.  Then the NOISE again.  Louder now. And it's getting closer.  Much closer.  SUDDENLY something grabs Miller's shoulder.
MILLER (CONT'D)
Jesus!
Lex (O.S.)
No one goes anywhere alone. 
Lex removes her hand. Miller attempts calm. He fails.
MILLER
There's something in here.
LEX
I doubt it. 
MILLER
Over there... 
Lex raises her FLASHLIGHT, piercing the darkness.
MiLLER (CONT'D)
Listen.
And now they both hear it. Something is moving. Now they both shine their flashlights into the darkness.  And then it emerges from behind a table - a terrifying, deadly...PENGUIN.
MILLER (CONT'D)
For God's sake ...
LEX
It's a penguin.
MILLER
I thought it might be...
No, he didn't. And Lex knows it. Miller stares at the Penguin and the Penguin stares back.  Inquisitive and unafraid.
LEX
Careful...
Lex smiles at Miller.  He really is out of his depth.
LEX (CONT'D)
...they do bite.
There is SHOUTING outside. And as Lex walks away, Miller takes the Penguin's picture.
EXT. rAZORBACK POINT-whaling station-perpetual twilight
As Lex and Miller emerge from the mess hall, they see Sebastian.  He's flushed and excited.
SEBASTIAN
Over here!  You're not going to believe this!
He leads them around the corner of the mess hall to reveal -- A GAPING HOLE in the snow and ice.  Perfectly round.  Ten feet across.  Sebastian and the rest of the team are gathering around the hole.  Off to one side is Quinn's drilling equipment -- it's not even unpacked. 
QUINN
It's drilled at a perfect 30 degree angle.
LEX
How far does it go down?
WEYLAND
All the way to the pyramid.
Quinn nods to Sven and he lights a FLARE, then drops it down the shaft.  The flare falls... endlessly until its flickering light is finally SWALLOWED in the darkness.  It never hits bottom.
MiLLER
How was it done?
QUINN
Thermal equipment of some kind.
WEYLAND
Like yours?
Quinn shakes his head.  He glances at the building closest to the hole.  Whatever cut through the ice has also cut clean through the building, vaporizing wooden beams and metal walls.
QUINN
More advanced.  Incredibly powerful. I've never seen anything like it.
WEYLAND
I told you I wasn't the only one with a satellite. It must be another team.  Maybe the Chinese ...the Russians. Whoever it is, they clearly have better equipment than we do.
QUINN 
(to Weyland)
Listen, whoever cut this, sliced through pack ice, the building, the beams and solid metal walls.  We should find out what cut this before we proceed. 
mAX
I thought you were the best?
Quinn bristles.  He doesn't like criticism.
QUINN 
I am the best.  
LEX
It doesn't make any sense. Where's their base camp?
QUINN
She's right.
max
They must already be down there.
Lex examines the ice at the mouth of the hole.
LEX
No. Look at the ice. There's no ridges. Nobody's been down there. 
WEYLAND
Satellite passed over eleven minutes ago. Get me the data. 
Max moves off to do that.
EXT. Whaling station-mouth of the tunnel (miNUTES LATER)
Weyland spreads a satellite photo over the hood of the Haaglund for Lex,Sebastian,Miller,Max,Quinn and Verheiden.
WEYLAND
There it is.  Clear as day.
The familiar pattern of interlocking square shapes.  Only this time, a long red line (the tunnel) connects them to the surface of the ice.
WEYLAND (CONT'D)
And this time yesterday...
Weyland replaces the photo with one taken 24 hours earlier.  The square shapes are the same, but there is no tunnel.
WEYLAND (CONT'D)
... nothing.
SEBASTIAN
So whoever cut this, they did it in the last 24 hours.
QUINN
That's just not possible.
seBASTIAN
It's here. It's done.
QUINN
I'm telling you there's no team and no machine in the world that could cut to this depth in twenty-four hours. 
WEYLAND
The only way we're going to know for sure is to get down there and find out. 
EXT. WHALING STATION-mOUTH OF THE TUNNEL(half hour later)
A scene of frantic activity. The team is preparing for a descent into the unknown.  Ropes are dropped into the void.  A WINCH and PULLEY system is being built over the mouth of the tunnel by Sven, Boris and Mikkel.  
Miller watches Quinn's team work.  He scratches his head and pulls his WOOLEN HAT off in frustration.
LEX 
Put your hat back on.
MILLER
It itches.
(NB: SCENE 38 CONTINUES ON PAGE 29)
LEX
I saw a man lose both his ears with frostbite.  With the ear canal exposed, you can see a full inch inside your head.
Lex smiles sweetly and walks away.  HOLD on Miller as he REACTS and then hurriedly puts his hat back on.
At the tunnel mouth Quinn yells at his men.
QUINN
Okay guys!  What's taking so long? There's a storm coming!!
INT. hAAGLUND - cONTINUOUS
Lex pulls open the door to the Haaglund.  She thought the cab was empty, but instead Lex finds Weyland sitting there alone.  He's struggling, breathing from a portable oxygen bottle. Weyland lowers his mask. His power and wealth are instantly dwarfed by his vulnerability. She looks him over.  They don't say anything for the longest time.  Then, gently: 
LEX
There's no room for sick men on this expedition.
weYLAND
My doctors tell me the worst is behind me.
leX 
You're not a very good liar, Mr. Weyland.
Weyland looks at her.
leX (CONT'D)
Stay on the ship.  We'll update you at the top of every hour. 
WEYLAND
You know, when you get sick, you think about your life and how you're going to be remembered. You know what I realized would happen when I go?  A ten percent fall in share prices.  Maybe twelve. And that's it.  I need this.  
Lex considers this.
LEX
I've heard this speech before.    My dad broke his leg seven hundred feet from the summit of Mount Ranier. He was like you -- he wouldn't go back or let us stop.  We reached the top and he opened a bottle of champagne.
(bittersweet agony)
Had my first drink with my dad at  fourteen thousand four hundred feet. 
(SCENE 39 CONTINUES ON PAGE 30)
It's a memory she will carry with her forever.
LEX (CONT'D)
On the way down, he developed a blood clot in his leg that traveled to his lung. He suffered for four hours before dying twenty minutes from the base. 
WeYLAND
You think that's the last thing your dad remembers? The pain? 
She shakes her head.  She doesn't know.
WeYLAND (CONT'D)
Or drinking champagne with his daughter fourteen thousand feet in the air?
She looks at him for the longest time -- and then she nods.  And closes the door.   
INT. pREDATOR SPACECRAFT - armory
A long thin viewing window at the front of the spacecraft.  Through it, an awesome VIEW of the Earth spread out below us.   Standing against the window -- THREE PREDATORS in SILHOUETTE, outlined against the blue green globe.  Weapons in their hands.  The HUNTERS, preparing for the HUNT.
They assemble their weapons.  Metal pieces sliding together to form a Predator SPEAR.
SWISH SWISH!  A BLADE cuts through the air.  Its sharpness being tested.  BANDAGES are wrapped around Alien hands, like ancient GLADIATORS preparing for combat.  
ARMOR is slipped on, covering legs, face and torso.
IN THE BACKGROUND a bank of computer screens.  Their design all in keeping with the techno-medieval feel of Predator technology.  A grainy image plays on the screens - it is a live feed, showing something that is occurring far below on Earth. It's our team, and they are being closely watched at the mouth of the tunnel.
INT. tunnel - 700 feet below the surface
A full two dozen members of the team are rappeling down the ice tunnel.  Helmet lights illuminate the scene.  Following them are three large sledges being lowered via the winch and pulley.  The sledges contain all the team's heavy equipment. Max drops down parallel to Sebastian.  Lex is ahead of the group.  She pulls out a PITON GUN to drive pitons on the ice wall. Lex hangs small lights every twenty feet on the pitons.
SCENE 40. HAS BEEN DELETED.
ext. mouth of the tunnel - continuouS
The storm has struck the whaling station.  Tents are being uprooted, as Quinn and his men struggle with the equipment.
INT. TUNNEL - 700 FEET BELOW THE SURFACE 
Max lowers himself to the same level as Weyland and Lex.
MAX
Quinn says there's a storm
WEYLAND
(to Lex)
Will it affect us?
LEX
We're 700 feet deep. Quinn could be setting off an atom bomb up there and we'd never notice.
ext. mouth of the tunnel - continuouS
As a tent is uprooted, it flies past Quinn and gets jammed in the winching gear.
INT. tunnel - 700 feet below the surface
Suddenly the rope that Weyland is on jerks tight and catches the side of the tunnel, smashing Weyland into the ice.  For a millisecond Weyland thinks he's saved but then the rope snaps and he begins to hurtle down the steep shaft.  Max and Sebastian desperately try and grab him but they both just miss.
SeBASTIAN
Man down!  Lex watch out!
Lex sees Weyland coming, as we see just how fast her reflexes are.  She pins Weyland against the tunnel wall, holding him in place by driving an ICE AXE into the ice, preventing him from falling further down into the tunnel.
A moment's hesitation from Lex, and Weyland might have died.  Lex reworks Weyland's rope to secure him in place.  The two are face-to-face.
LEX
You okay?
(off his nod)
Thank you.
weYLAND
You saved my life... remember?
She shakes her head -- not for this.
LEX
For what you said.
Weyland nods.
MAX
What the hell is going on up there, Quinn?
EXT. mOUTH OF THE TUNNEL - cONTINUOUS
Quinn stands by the winching gear.  A couple of his men are working frantically on the machinery.
QUINN
A jam in the winching gear.  
MAX (O.S.)
Get it fixed right away.
QUINN
No problem. 
(under his breath)
English asshole.
EXT. SURFACE - perpetual tWILIGHT
No one is here to see that something is approaching at INCREDIBLE SPEED. It's the Predator Spacecraft cloaked in the fury of the storm.
SCENES 44, 45 & 46 HAVE BEEN deleted.
EXT. mouth of the tunneL - pERPETUAL TWILIGHT
The whaling station is already in the grip of the katabatic winds. Quinn struggles through the snow, barking orders above the DEAFENING STORM.
QUINN
I told you to get that tied down!
Get everybody under cover!
Tents are being uprooted by the wind.  Flung through the air like tissue paper.
QUINN (CONT'D)
Everyone inside!  Move it!  Now!
Quinn moves his men into the Whaling Station buildings.
QUINN (CONT'D)
Go!  Go!
LOW ANGLE ON QUINN as suddenly the SPACECRAFT passes overhead.  Its massive bulk lost in the storm.  A moment later, Quinn looks up, perhaps sensing something, but the spacecraft is already gone, leaving just turbulence in its wake.
EXT. pREDATOR SPACECRAFT - perpetual twilight 
The Predator spacecraft cuts through the storm.  The tremendous force of the katabatic winds that would destroy any ordinary plane have no effect on the futuristic spacecraft.  Suddenly, THREE shimmering STEEL MISSILES are FIRED from the belly of the craft.
EXT. ground level - cONTINUOUS
Three massive EXPLOSIONS of snow and ice as the Predator missiles impact with the ground. 
ON ONE OF THE CRATERS caused by the impact.  At its heart lies one of the missiles, still intact.  The missile is cylindrical.  Twelve feet long and four feet wide.  Like a giant steel coffin; CRANE UP to reveal: 
ANOTHER TWO CRATERS stretching off into the distance.  And in each one -- another steel coffin.
EXT. mOUTH OF THE TUNNEL - PERPETUAL TWILIGHT
Everyone is sheltering from the storm.  The winching equipment stands abandoned.  But a lone digital counter is still flashing away -- measuring the depth to which the team have descended. 1,980 ... 1,990 ... 2,000. They have reached the bottom.
INT. ice grotto - 2OOO FEET BELOW
In contrast to the deafening storm above, underground, everything is calm.  Silent.  Lex lights a cool blue FLARE, illuminating a scene of surreal beauty.  They are in an ICE GROTTO, surrounded by giant stalactites and stalagmites made of frozen glacial water.  Everything around them shimmers and pulses in the light of the flare.  The walls are translucent.
Up ahead, the grotto opens out into a bigger ice cave.  A vast ceiling vaulting off above them into the darkness.  No telling how big this place is.
MAX
Let's get those lights up.
Connors
Any second now.
Max's men are already unpacking multiple sets of portable floodlights. They begin hooking them to power cables which run back up the tunnel to generators on the surface.
WEYLAND
I don't understand...  
Weyland looks around the grotto, breathless from the descent.
WEYLAND (CONT'D)
No equipment. No sign of another team.
MAX
Well this tunnel didn't dig itself.
Connors
We have power!
MAX
Let's light her up.
As one, multiple banks of powerful floodlights kick in.  The sudden REFLECTIONS from the glacial ice are blinding.
ANGLE ON LEX shielding her eyes.  Slowly she lowers her hand. Sebastian turns to see what Lex has seen.  He stops dead in amazement.  
We still don't know what they have seen.  But whatever it is, it's breathtaking.  One by one, the CAMERA TRACKS PAST the team members.  Each one is slack-jawed.
(NB: SCENE 51 CONTINUES ON PAGE 35)
AND SLOWLY THE CAMERA PANS AROUND TO REVEAL THE PYRAMID, towering above them. The hundreds of stone steps covered in shimmering blue ice crystals. The team look like tiny ants standing before it. Two thirds of the magnificent structure is fully visible, the rest is buried in the translucent walls of the ice cave.  It's an awesome sight.
LEX
Congratulations,  Mr. Weyland.  Looks like you'll be leaving your mark after all.
Lex and Weyland share a look.  Despite being short on breath, Weyland cracks a broad smile and turns to the group.
WEYLAND
Thank you all for this.
(a beat)
Let's make history.
EXT. impact crater - perpetual twilight
Back on the surface, the impact crater where one of the Predator "missiles" landed.  Around it, the katabatic winds are still raging.  
CLOSE ON THE "MISSILE" as a hairline crack appears in the steel.  It runs the length of the cylinder. The crack widens and high pressure gas begins to vent. After a moment the missile breaks open completely and a Predator hand emerges.
EXT. whaling station - mouth of tunnel-perpetual twilight
Quinn and his men are all under cover hiding from the storm.  Quinn hears THE PREDATOR BATTLE CRY. The sound is chilling.  Primal. And after a moment, it is snatched away in the wind.
EXT. PYRAMID STEPS
The team make their way up the steps towards the entrance chamber.
INT. pyramid - entrance chamber
The team walks into an entrance that is located half-way up the pyramid. 
Lex illuminates a PICTOGRAM showing two creatures locked in combat (an Alien and Predator).  She looks down and takes a bearing on her digital compass.
Above the entrance are three lines of ANCIENT HIEROGLYPHICS.
thomAS
I recognize the Egyptian.  Not the other two.
seBASTIAN
The second line is Aztec.  Pre-conquest era.  Third is Cambodian. Looks like a mixture of Bantu and Sanskrit.
Sebastian catches Lex watching him.
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Impressed?
lEX
Maybe.  
weYLAND
Then you were right. The pyramid does contain all three cultures?
seBASTIAN
That's what it looks like. 
(excited)
This goes against every history book that's ever been written.  
thOMAS
(translating first line)
...you may -- choose -- to enter.  Those who choose may enter.   
miLLER
It's like an ancient welcome mat.
seBASTIAN
(stepping forward)
Who taught you to translate?  
thOMAS
Funny, he looks just like you.
SEBASTIAN
It's not "choose," partner, it's "chosen."
Sebastian steps up to examine the writing more closely.
seBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Only the...chosen ones may enter.    
Verheiden takes the first step through the entrance, stepping on an ornate stone tile which SINKS ever so slightly into the ground. A hidden trigger of some kind. No one notices as the team enter one by one.
Int. PrEDATOR SPACECRAFT.
The computer onboard the Predator spaceship is still projecting the hologram of the pyramid.  The humans are all represented by tiny holographic figures.  The humans' presence within the pyramid has activated something deep within the structure.  THE CAMERA closes in on this vast room at the base of the pyramid and we --
MATCH dissolve TO:

INT. pyRAMID - alien queen's chamber
A vast chamber.  At its heart, a deep pool of freezing vapor -- not unlike the kind created by liquid nitrogen.  Hi-tech chains of incredible tensile strength run from the ceiling and down into the vapor pool, disappearing from sight. 
The trigger Verheiden stepped on has activated something and SUDDENLY, THE CHAINS BEGIN TO MOVE.
(NB: SCENE 54A CONTINUES ON PAGE 36)
They are pulling something up massive from the vapor pool.  And slowly, majestically, she rises out of the freezing mist like some mythic beast -- AN ALIEN QUEEN. A GIANT OF HER SPECIES.  And around the Alien Queen is built a grotesque MACHINE, in which she is being held prisoner.  A complex web of pipes and tubes which pierce her body in a hundred different places.  She is literally part of the machine, the ultimate BIO-MECHANICAL synthesis. This machine which holds the Alien Queen prisoner, is clearly of Predator design, for it has all the familiar TECHNO-MEDIEVAL features.  It could almost be some giant gothic torture device from the Inquisition.
As the chains continue to lift the Alien Queen into the air, we see that these shackles are attached to her every limb.  There are even holes punched through the "crown" above her head, through which chains run.  The lifting chains LOCK into place, leaving the Alien Queen suspended in mid-air, hanging above the floor of the chamber like some great DRAGON caught in flight.  
It's a stunning, terrifying image. Close on the Alien Queen unmoving.  Her head covered in a thin sheet of ice.  Residue of the freezing vapor in which she has been stored.
SUDDENLY, THE ICE BEGINS TO CRACK!
Without warning, the twin mouths of the Alien Queen shoot out and begin to snap at the air.  She is waking up.  Her whole body struggles and strains against the chains.  But in vain.  Despite her immense size and incredible strength, she is a prisoner here.
CLOSE ON THE EGG SACK below the Alien Queen, held firmly in place by the Predator machine that surrounds her.  Almost as soon as the Alien Queen awakes, she begins to lay eggs.
Beneath the egg sack is an automated CONVEYOR BELT which takes the eggs away from the Alien Queen.  She lays every fifteen to twenty seconds, feeding the conveyor with a steady stream of eggs.  We now see that the whole chamber is one giant machine built to service the captive Alien Queen.  This could be an image from BOSCH or BREUGEL.
When the Alien Queen sees her eggs being taken from her, she goes BERSERK, straining against her chains to be free.  But it is hopeless. The Alien Queen SCREAMS in frustration.
INT. PYRAMID - ENTRANCE CHAMBER
The Alien Queen's scream barely pierces the long hallway that is covered in hieroglyphics, carved out of the stone but Sebastian and Miller, focused on their work, don't hear it. Thomas is examining another section of the hieroglyphics. 
SEBASTIAN
I've never seen anything like it.  The hieroglyphics look to be some kind of hybrid language...
Containing both Aztec and Egyptian characteristics.
Miller is near a stone running a basic spectral analysis.
miller
This reading says these stones are at least ten thousand years old.
Sebastian looks at him -- doubtful.
SEBASTIAN
That's impossible. Check it again.
MILLER
I already did.  
Lex drops a SMALL STROBE LIGHT behind her, then another. Lex realizes that Sebastian is watching her.
LEX 
They'll burn for six hours.  We'll be able to find our way back.
INT. pyRAMID - sacrificial chamber
Lex leads the team into the next chamber.  Their flashlights illuminate a large chamber with an impressive vaulted ceiling and bizarre ancient imagery chiseled into the walls.  SEVEN MUMMIFIED CADAVERS lay on SEVEN LONG STONE SLABS.
weYLAND
These are...
SeBASTIAN
Sacrificial slabs.
THOMAS
Just like the Aztecs and the Egyptians. Whoever built this pyramid believed in ritual sacrifice.  
milLER
(studying cadaver)
It's almost perfectly preserved. 
thomas
This is where they offered the "chosen ones" to the gods.
SEBASTIAN 
Those that were chosen would lie here.  They weren't bound or tied in any way.  They went to their deaths willingly.  Men and Women. It was considered an honor.
LEX
Lucky them.
She runs her fingers around a circular, bowl like indentation at the base of the slab.
LEX (CONT'D)
What's this bowl for?
SEBASTIAN
Some think it's where the heart was placed after it was torn from the body.
Weyland's flashlight illuminates a stone grate on the bottom of the floor with small holes in it.  Max strikes a flare and drops it in one of the holes.  It falls but hits something below.  
WeYLAND 
What have you found Max? 
Max
It's a shaft to another level. Looks like another room down there. 
Weyland illuminates a HUGE pile of HUMAN BONES.  Many of the skeletons are still intact. 
weYLAND
There must be a hundred people there.
(NB: SCENE 55 CONTINUES ON PAGE 38)
mAX
At least.
The others cluster around the mountain of bleached bones.
Thomas examines some hieroglyphics written on the edge of a sacrificial slab.
THOMAS
(translating)
They gave their lives ... So that the hunt might begin.
Rousseau (O.S.)
What happened here? 
Rousseau is examining the ribcage of a skeleton. A hole has been punched through the bones.
tHOMAS
It was common in ritual sacrifice to take the heart of the victim.
ROUSSEAU 
That's not where your heart is.  Besides, it looks like the bones were bent straight out. Something broke out of this body.  
Everyone reacts to Rousseau's words. Thomas finds something amongst the bones.
miller 
Incredible.  The entire skull and spinal column removed in one piece.
He holds it up for everyone to see.
milleR (CONT'D)
The cleanness of the cut... remarkable.  Straight through bone.  No abrasions. 
(NB: SCENE 55 CONTINUES ON PAGE 39)
leX
Did you hear that? 
The entire team looks around and then looks at Lex.
MYSTERY POV: Sebastian and Thomas can be seen isolated in a pool of light.  They suddenly look very small and vulnerable as they stand away from the rest of the team. We hear A NOISE. Faint, nearly imperceptible, but there. 
MILLER
Air... moving through the tunnels.
SEBASTIAN
I don't know. Maybe.
Sebastian moves forward. Cautiously edging his way toward the source of the noise. The team shines their flashlights, they cut through the gloom like lasers as they illuminate the chamber. Sebastian casts multiple shadows on the walls around him. If anything, the lights are making it even creepier. Miller starts to handle one of the spinal columns hanging on the wall.
sebaSTIAN (CONT'D)
(to Miller)
Be careful with that.
Sebastian has to crouch as the ceiling of the back of the chamber slopes down dramatically.   
Around Sebastian, everything is CLAUSTROPHOBIC and DARK.  SOMETHING FALLS FROM ABOVE and lands on Sebastian.
IT'S A CREATURE with multiple legs and a long tail. Sebastian fights it away from his face. He falls to the ground, and the creature is gone.
(NB: SCENE 55 CONTINUES ON PAGE 40)
Lex spots it on the ground. Sebastian and Lex walk up and kneel by the CREATURE.  It's an ALIEN "FACE HUGGER".
miLLER
Whatever it is, it's been dead a while.  The bones have calcified.
He tests the legs of the Face Hugger.  They are rock solid.
lEX
You must have dislodged it from a crack in the ceiling.
sebASTIAN
No idea how long it's been here but the temperature has kept it preserved. Looks like some kind of scorpion.
LEX
No.  Climate's too hostile for a scorpion. 
SEBASTIAN
Ever seen anything like it?
She turns the Face Hugger over in her hands, studies it and shakes her head. 
sebastian (CONT'D)
Maybe it's a species that's never been discovered.
Lex looks at it again. Concerned and unsure.
LEX
Maybe.
Lex illuminates another passage. Now inside and overdressed, Lex takes off her jacket.
LEX (CONT'D)
The ambient temperature in here is a lot warmer than ground level. You can take off your jackets. 
Sebastian, Miller, Weyland, Connors, Max, Rousseau and Thomas begin to remove their jackets. 
WeYLAND
(to Max)
Time to move on.  Let's move to that lower room Max.
Max turns to the group.
MAX
Time to move out everybody. Ms. Woods?
Max motions to Lex to take the lead. Sebastian, Miller, Weyland and Connors follow Lex down a tunnel.  Hanging back momentarily, Max gives instructions to Thomas and Rousseau. 
max (CONT'D)
(to Thomas)
You, stay here.
(to Rousseau)
Rousseau, stay with him.  Keep a team with you.
(to Thomas)
Catalog everything.
(to everyone)
Let's go.
Max leaves Thomas and Rousseau behind and joins the others. Thomas takes out his digital video camera.

THERE IS NO SCENE NUMBER 58
EXT. MOUTH OF THE TUNNEL - PERPETUAL TWILIGHT 
At the whaling station KLAUS is keeping watch.  The storm has lost none of its fury, and he's huddled by one wall of the mess hall, trying to keep out of the worst of it.
SUDDENLY a figure emerges from the WHITEOUT.  Klaus snaps up his DESERT EAGLE and points it at the intruder.
klaus
Hold it right there.  Identify yourself!
QUINN
It's...
Quinn finds himself staring straight down the barrel of the biggest handgun in the world.
QUINN (CONT'D)
Quinn!
He tears off his hood and mask so he can be seen.  Klaus lowers the Desert Eagle. 
QUINN (CONT'D)
What the hell are you doing?
klaus
Following orders.  Weyland wants this area secured.
QUINN
From who?
klaus
Claim jumpers.  The Russians, the Chinese... another corporation.  Anybody could be out there. 
QUINN
Trust me.  There's nobody out there.
Quinn continues on his way, struggling through the storm.  He's checking on the equipment.  Ensuring that everything is tied down correctly.
INT. mess hall - Perpetual twilight
The building outside which Klaus is keeping watch.  The Mess Hall is the closest structure to the mouth of the tunnel.  The walls groan under the strain of the storm raging outside.  Sven and Boris are huddled around a camping stove, boiling water for tea. At the back of the shelter, Mikkel is working on a space heater.  
sven
When are you going to get that heater started?
mikkel
It's coming ...it's coming.
EXT. mESS HALL - PERPETUAL TWILIGHT
Suddenly, Klaus on sentry duty sees something.  In the depths of the storm, a flickering humanoid shape, given form by the flurries of snow. 
klaus
Quinn?
But the shape keeps moving, and a moment later is joined by another shimmering figure.  PREDATORS.  Headed for the mouth of the tunnel.  And that puts Klaus and the others directly in their path.
klaus (CONT'D)
Quinn? 
Klaus brings up his Desert Eagle and takes aim. He has one of the Cloaked Predators in his sights.
INT. mESS HALL - cONTINUOUS
The SOUND of a GUNSHOT from outside.  Then another.  
sven
Mikkel!  Get on the radio!  Now!
The door suddenly BLOWS OPEN but nothing enters except a flurry of snow.  Every man in the room draws a GUN. 
The blur of a CLOAKED PREDATOR enters the room. One man is hit by an INVISIBLE hand.  The force of the blow sending him crashing to the ground, his neck broken.   In an instant, another man seems to be LEVITATING!  His feet are a clear three feet off the ground, and he is rising still further into the air.  GURGLING noises are coming from the him.  Only now do we see the shimmering humanoid outline behind him.  A PREDATOR has IMPALED the man and is lifting him into the air!  
The last survivor draws a bead on the shimmering blur but is suddenly flung backwards with incredible force.  Something INVISIBLE has impaled him, slamming him back against the wall and pinning him there.  His feet hang six inches off the ground.  In his last dying moments, the man watches a FUTURISTIC SPEAR slowly materialize in his chest.
EXT. main street - peRPETUAL TWILIGHT
Quinn hears what sounds like gun shots and runs toward the mess hall.
int. mess hall - perpetual twiligHT
Quinn appears in the doorway.    
QUINN
What's all the ...
Quinn stops dead.  The room is devastated.  Quinn sees three bodies hanging from the rafters by their ankles.  Quinn's lips move, but there is no sound.
WHAT QUINN SEES: A shimmering figure moving toward him.  Humanoid but not human.  Predator.  The distinctive TWIN BLADES slide from the Predator's wrist.  Quinn sees these blades perfectly, for the razor sharp edges are outlined with the steaming blood of dead men.
FROM NOWHERE - A PREDATOR SPEAR in mid air.  Headed right for him.  Quinn slams the door to the mess hall, but the spear slices straight through it, cutting his arm.  Quinn has bought himself a few seconds.  He uses them to run.
EXT. mouth of the tunnel - continuous
Quinn stumbles through the WHITEOUT.  Suddenly he runs STRAIGHT into something.  Looks up in SHOCK to see -- A DEAD BODY.  What's left of Klaus.  After that, Quinn sees three more bodies.  All strung up by their ankles.  Swaying in the wind. Quinn's entire team is dead.
Half buried in the snow, Quinn sees Klaus' gun.  He reaches for it, but as he brings up the Desert Eagle --
FROM NOWHERE A PREDATOR APPEARS!  
The Predator knocks the gun out of Quinn's hand.  We prepare for a fight between the Predator and the one man who can probably fight a Predator. Quinn finds a pipe buried in the snow and picks it up.
He charges the Predator and swings at him but the Predator swats it away as if it were a toy and backhands Quinn in the chest.  Quinn goes down hard.  He is stunned by the Predator's power. 
Quinn won't surrender. He starts to pick himself up but as he does the Predator steps on his leg, snapping it in half like a piece of wood resting on two rocks.  Quinn screams in pain.    
The Predator kicks him in the ribs, sending him into the air and down the mouth of the tunnel! Quinn screams as he continues to fall! 
INT. tuNNEL - 200 feet below the surface
Quinn slides down the tunnel, gaining speed every second.  His hands grasp desperately at the icy walls, the cabling of the winch system, anything to help slow his descent.  He pulls out his ice axe and strikes it into the ice to slow himself down.  Shards of ice spray everywhere.
EXT. mOUTH OF THE TUNNEL - continuous
The cloaked Predator stands above the entrance to the tunnel.  His GHOSTLY OUTLINE flickering and changing with the eddies in the wind.  He lets loose the Predator BATTLE CRY.  And behind him, two more WRAITHS step from the storm.
SCENE 66. HAS BEEN DELETED.
EXT. mOUTH OF THE TUNNEL - continuous
CLOSE ON A PREDATOR -- as he activates his WRIST COMPUTER.  Displayed on it we see a three dimensional representation of the Pyramid below the ice.  From the very heart of the Pyramid there is an ELECTRONIC PULSE.  A HOMING SIGNAL of some kind which the Predators are clearly following.  THE CAMERA CLOSES IN on the electronic pulse until it FILLS THE FRAME.  Then we slowly DISSOLVE through to the source of the homing signal --
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. pyRAMID - sarcophagus chamber
Flashlight beams cut through the darkness.  
Lex checks her digital compass.
LEX
We must be directly beneath the sacrificial chamber.
Up ahead there is a small amber glow. Weyland, Lex, Sebastian, Miller, Max, and Connors enter in a vast chamber of some kind. They find the flares they dropped through the grate in the sacrificial chamber.  They look up and quickly realize that the sacrificial chamber is directly above them, linked by a stone shaft of some kind.
SEBASTIAN
We're at the heart of the pyramid.
Lex sees something. The rest of them train their flashlights on the object.  At the center of the room is a Sarcophagus.  Fifteen feet long, four feet wide.  Approximately the same dimensions as the Predator "missiles."
The ornate room is lit by flares in every corner.  Sebastian carefully examines the Sarcophagus.
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Some kind of sarcophagus... Egyptian in design. These were built to protect the dead for their journey to the afterworld.
Weyland runs his hand over the Sarcophagus.  It is encrusted with ice crystals, glittering in the half light.  
weYLAND
Max, Verheiden. Open it.
Max and Verheiden move to opposite sides of the Sarcophagus.  They push hard but the lid doesn't move. They dig in and push with everything they have but still nothing.   
SEBASTIAN
Excuse me ...
Max and Verheiden take a step back as brains replace brawn.  Sebastian stands over the Sarcophagus.  His flashlight illuminates three metal dials inlaid into the stone.  
LEX
What is it?
seBASTIAN 
(deep in concentration)
Some kind of combination lock.  
Sebastian kneels by a line of pictograms and hieroglyphics that run around the edge of the stone slab.  He studies the designs.  
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
This is The Long Count ... the Mayan calendar.  Days, months, years.  
He looks between the hieroglyphics and the combination lock.
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
This must be the combination.
Sebastian illuminates the three metal dials on top of the Sarcophagus.
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Days ... months ... years ...
LEX
But what date?
SEBASTIAN
The dials are set for ...
Sebastian hesitates for a moment.  Then:  
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
... 1904.  
He rechecks the hieroglyphics, not quite believing what he is seeing --
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Exactly one hundred years ago. 
LEX
Someone opened this a hundred years ago?
Sebastian gives her that knowing smile of his.
SEBASTIAN
Only one way to find out.
Sebastian turns the first of the metal dials on the top of the Sarcophagus.  It moves easily.  Sebastian glances over at  Lex.  
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
What's today's date?
LEX
October 10th.
SeBASTIAN
10 ... 10 ... 2004.
WEYLAND
You sure this is going to work?
SeBASTIAN
I don't know.
As the tension mounts, Sebastian turns the remaining two discs.
The entire team is stunned as the lid to the Sarcophagus begins to open UNDER ITS OWN POWER. 
Everyone reacts as the lid finishes opening and slides to a smooth halt. The interior of the Sarcophagus is dark.  There's no way you can see in without peering dangerously over the edge.
Sebastian cautiously approaches the edge, and slowly peers inside.  
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Take a look at this.
The others crowd around the Sarcophagus. The interior of the Sarcophagus contains -- GUNS.  Three futuristic weapons of an alien design. PREDATOR DESIGN.  
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
(quietly ominous)
The master culture.
SCENE 69 HAS BEEN DELETED.
THERE IS NO SCENE NUMBER 70
EXT. pyRAMID - ice grotto
Quinn's body lies near the tunnel entrance.  He is covered in frost.  Looks like he never regained consciousness and has frozen to death.  
CLOSE ON QUINN as his eyes suddenly pop open.  He's ALIVE,  but barely.  His body temperature is incredibly low and his heart is barely beating.  He can hardly move.  Suddenly the frost around his face begins to crack and melt as this once fearless man sweats with undeniable fear. 
QUINN POV: Three Predators appear at the mouth of the grotto.  They have descended the tunnel. They are headed straight toward him.  Quinn tries to struggle away from them, but he is frozen stiff.  All he can do is watch helpless as the Predators get closer and closer.  
PREDATOR VISION: In their heat vision, the half-frozen Quinn is virtually invisible.  They are blinded by the bright lights illuminating the pyramid.
Quinn is holding his breath.  He can't believe it as the Predators walk STRAIGHT PAST him.  So close that he could reach out and touch them.                                
(NB. SCENE 71 IS CONTINUED ON PAGE 46)  After a moment, Quinn cranes his neck to see where the Predators are going.  He sees two shapes headed straight for the Pyramid.
Just when Quinn thought he was safe, he turns around and sees the third Predator standing right over him.  He was never fooled, only waiting for Quinn to show himself. 
CLOSE ON THE TWIN BLADES as it scythes down toward Quinn.
INT. pyRAMID - sarcophagus chamber
Sebastian and Max are standing over the sarcophagus staring at the futuristic guns.  They're a little freaked.  
miLLER
Any idea what those are?
seBASTIAN
Nope.  You?
miLLER
No.
max
Good thing we brought in the experts.
mILLER
(turning to him)
Hey.  We just found the equivalent of a DVD player in Moses' living room.  Why don't you give us a second to figure it out.
MaX
Well to me, it looks like sophisticated weaponry.
Lex looks to Weyland for a smile but instead sees that Weyland is having a hard time breathing.  Weyland pulls out his hand-held portable oxygen bottle and takes a shot into his lungs.
seBASTIAN 
Is he okay?
lEX
It's just asthma.  He's fine.
miLLER
Let me see if I can get a base reading off the metal.
Miller steps up and starts a basic spectral analysis of the metal, careful not to disturb the guns.  His hand-held computer starts processing the information.  
miLLEr (CONT'D)
There are two chemicals here. Tilanium and Cadmium 240. 
seBASTIAN
Never heard of them.
MiLLER
They're found in meteorites. 
seBASTIAN
Meteorites?
MILLER
Whatever these are, they weren't made here.
seBASTIAN
When you say here, you mean...?
MILLER
Earth.
Verheiden looks concerned. In fact everyone does - except Lex. Her eyes are focused on  the person she is worried about most - Weyland. She speaks quietly to him.
lEX
How you doing?
Weyland nods but he's not doing well and he can't hide it.
lEX (CONT'D)
(to the group)
We've been out long enough for today.  We're going to set up base camp tonight at the whaling station and we'll get back at it first thing tomorrow morning.  
max
You can go back to base camp Ms. Woods.  We're going to stay here. 
LEX
You wanted to leave without proper prep and we did. You wanted to be the first here, we are. You've claimed the find. It's yours. Now we move as a team and we're done for today.  
Everyone looks at Weyland to over rule her.  
weyLAND
You heard her.
The team starts out. 
max 
What should we do about the guns, Mr. Weyland?
weYLAND 
Take them. We can run further tests on the surface.
seBASTIAN
No...don't touch them!
Too late. Connors reaches into the Sarcophagus and grabs the first two guns.  Max reaches in and grabs the final gun but when the weight of Max's gun is removed from its place inside the chamber, a hidden trigger underneath it is activated with a deafening: CLICK!  The click echoes around the chamber.  Everyone shares concerned looks.  
For a moment nothing, then it happens. The walls of the chamber begin to move.  Sealing up the old entrances, and revealing brand new passageways into and out of the chamber.                  
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Watch out!  The doors!  Look out!
We MOVE PAST Lex, Sebastian, Miller, Max, and Connors. Weyland is standing before what used to be a solid wall only now it is open to a long dark corridor.
MILLER
Sebastian. That happens in all pyramids, right?
seBASTIAN
No. 
A large block of stone quickly starts to slide down and seals the entrance before anyone can get out.
SCENE 72A. HAS BEEN DELETED.
There is no scene 72a2.

SCENE 73 has been deleted.
INT. pyRAMID - sACRIFICIAL CHAMBER
Rousseau, Thomas and four other SCIENTISTS brace as the walls begin to move. The entrances to the chamber are sealed up by huge blocks of stone that slide down from the ceiling. 
Rousseau
(shouting to the others)
Get something under there!
And the scientists push a large metal case under the door but it's hopelessly crushed.
tHOMAS
You okay?
Perplexed, Rousseau looks at the walls that just moved.  They, too, are trapped.  Sealed in like the other team.
EXT. pyRAMID - ENTRANCE CHAMBER
The Predators have reached the Pyramid.  One of the Predators checks his wrist computer.  The nature of the homing signal has changed.  The electronic pulse has become more frantic and insistent.  They exchange concerned looks.  This clearly was not part of the plan. And the Predator's take off running, SPRINTING into the Pyramid.
INT. pyRAMID - sACRIFICIAL CHAMBER
Thomas, Rousseau, and four other SCIENTISTS struggle with the stone blocking the entrance.  Their attempts are in vain.  
Rousseau 
Slab's gotta weigh two tons. We'll never move it.
Thomas' eyes have found something.
(NB: SCENE 74B CONTINUES ON PAGE 50)
THOMAS
What is that?
At the bottom of the sacrificial slabs, beneath the mummified bodies, an ALIEN EGG has suddenly appeared.  It sits snugly in the bowl shaped indentation which Lex had observed earlier.  The stone slabs themselves are silently splitting apart, allowing the Alien Eggs to rise up into the indentations from within.  
tHOMAS (CONT'D)
There. Another.  One more.
Now all seven sacrificial slabs have an Egg on them.  There is a long silence.  The first Egg begins to open.
One by one the other eggs begin to open. Rousseau pulls out a COLT.45, keeping it at her side.
Rousseau
What did you say this room was called?
thOMAS
(scared)
The Sacrificial Chamber.
Rousseau brings up her HANDGUN but it's too late.  The Face Hugger is already airborne.  The other six launch themselves simultaneously.
THE CAMERA SWITCHES TO EXTREME SLOW MOTION - to capture the unique sight of SEVEN Face Huggers frozen for a moment in  MID-AIR.  It's awesome to behold.
One of the Face Huggers is leaping directly AT CAMERA.  As it inches towards us in SLOW MOTION, the CAMERA spins through 180 degrees around the creature, to reveal its intended victim.  It's Rousseau.  Terror frozen on her face.  Then return to real time: In a split second, the Face Hugger completes its flight.  Slamming into Rousseau's face, smothering her mouth, muffling her screams.  Their SCREAMS ECHO through the stone grate in the floor...
Int. Sarcophagus shaft
A FRANTIC TORTURED SCREAM and SEVERAL PISTOL SHOTS are heard through the stone grate directly above them...
THERE are NO SCENE NUMBERs 75,76,77 & 78.
INT. sARCOPHAGUS CHAMBER
....as Lex prepares to lead the team down the long dark corridor. BURSTS OF BRIGHT LIGHT fill the room from above as it slices through the slats of the grate like lasers. 
MiLLER
Lex! What's going on!
LEX
(to Max)
Get Rousseau and Thomas.
Max grabs the walkie-talkie.
max
(into walkie-talkie)
Rousseau?  Come in, Rousseau.  
sebaSTIAN
(into walkie-talkie)
Thomas?  Tommy.  Come in!  Tommy.  Come in.  Thomas can you hear me?
Sebastian looks at Lex. He shakes his head. So does Max.
max 
Nothing.
Fear starts to spread around the chamber.
leX 
Is there anything you didn't tell me about this place?
weYLAND
Nothing. I have no idea what this is. 
LEX 
Well, whatever it is, we're not prepared for it. We're going to round up the rest of the team and get to the surface.  Let's move.
Lex stares down the long dark corridor behind Weyland.
Max and Connors open an equipment case.  From within they start to take an arsenal of HEAVY WEAPONS.  They are joined by three other men -- BASS, STONE and VERHEIDEN.
LEX (CONT'D)
What are you doing?
MAX
My job. Yours is over.
Max slams a magazine home into his MP-5 -- he does a lock and load with rapid precision. 
lEX
I told you -- when I lead a team, I don't leave my team. My job is over when everyone is back on the boat safely and that gun doesn't change anything.
max
Mister Weyland?
Weyland looks at Max and Lex.
weYLAND
She brought us here, she's getting us home. You and your crew back her up.
Max nods, following orders. Around the room, a series of MACHINE GUNS are quickly loaded. The SOUND of the mechanical LOADING and COCKING of the guns ECHO throughout the long corridor.
max 
(to Lex)
After you. 
Lex consults her digital wrist compass.
LEX 
This bearing should take us back to the entrance. We make it to the surface and we regroup at the Whaling station. 
seBASTIAN
What about Thomas and Rousseau?
LEX
We'll find them on the way out.   
And Lex leads the team through the long corridor.
MAX
Stone ... Verheiden ... Cover our backs!
Int. PyRAMID - sacRIFICIAL CHAMBER
Tight close up on a Face Hugger.  As we pull back, reveal that the Face Hugger lies beside Rousseau.  Pull back even more to reveal 5 more bodies laying on the ground all with Face Huggers on them. 
Rousseau wakes, in immediate agony.  She claws at her chest.  Something is trying to GET OUT!!  With a spurt of (PG-13 friendly) blood, a CHEST BURSTER erupts. 
Another set of ALIEN EGGS have appeared at the bottom of the sacrificial slabs, in the bowl shaped indentation.  
INT. pYRAMID - sARCOPHAGUS CHAMBER
Weyland and his team have gone. An optical blur passes in front of the CAMERA, and moments later, a Predator materializes.  He stares down into the Sarcophagus.  We see it reflected in the eye sockets of his armored face plate.  The Sarcophagus is empty.  The Predator Plasma Guns are missing.  The humans have taken them.
PREDATOR VISION: As the Predator intensifies the amplitude of his heat vision. 
(NB: SCENE 79 CONTINUES ON PAGE 52)
 Slowly, boot prints begin to appear on the floor.  The residual heat left by the team.  The tell-tale prints lead away from the Sarcophagus to the long corridor the team is moving through.  The Predator HOWLS in ANGER, and then begins to follow the human footprints. 
THERE IS NO SCENE NUMBER 80
INT. pYRAMID - chamber of the gods
A long corridor stretching off into the darkness.
They keep moving.  Lex's flashlight illuminates A GIGANTIC STATUE.  Then ANOTHER.  The corridor is lined with them.
Each statue is a PREDATOR WARRIOR carved out of stone.  Miller and Sebastian stare up at one of these bizarre stone creatures.  They're humanoid in shape, though much larger than a human being in size. Their heads are larger and they're wearing massive helmets.  They're fierce, frightening and very powerful looking hunter/beasts. 
seBASTIAN
Dear God.
Many of the statues also show the Predators engaged in combat WITH another species... ALIENS.  The statues portray the Predators battling the Aliens as if they were george FIGHTING THE DRAGON. 
Max is staring at another elaborate drawing showing the  PREDATORS CARRYING THEIR DISTINCTIVE PLASMA GUNS -- THE ONES THEy're carrying. Lex walks up behind him.
LEX 
Recognize what's on their shoulders? 
Sebastian examines the walls of the chamber.  Ancient painted MURALS depict humans kneeling in supplication before the Predators.
MAX
We worshipped these things?
seBASTIAN
According to this we did.  And the artefacts you removed from the sarcophagus seem to be their weapons.
(NB: SCENE 81 CONTINUES ON PAGE 53)
PREDATOR VISION: From an obscure HIGH ANGLE, LOOKING DOWN on the group of humans.  The Predator ZOOMS IN, FOCUSING on the backpacks carried by Max, Verheiden and Bass.  Within the packs are the three Predator Plasma Guns.  THE PLASMA GUNS FILL THE FRAME.  
MILLER
The heat bloom that your satellite detected makes more sense now.  
weYLAND
What do you mean?
MiLLER
A building this sophisticated would require a major energy source.  That's what the satellite detected, the power plant for this Pyramid firing up... preparing.
weYLAND
Preparing for what?
Lex consults her digital compass.
LEX
Let's get moving.  Just another 200 yards to the entrance.
CLOSE ON A PREDATOR STATUE as the face of the statue softly distorts.  It's not a statue.  It's a real Predator. The human team have walked straight into an ambush!
Stone is bringing up the rear, MP-5 in hand. A NOOSE suddenly drops around his neck, pulls tight, and drags him into the air. Stone dies silently. 
CLOSE ON BASS as a Predator spear impales him.  The force hurling him back with astonishing force, pinning him to the stone wall.
MAX
Get down! 
CONNORS
What the hell was that?!
CLOSE ON A PREDATOR THROWING DISC: Spinning through the air, its razor-sharp edges catching the light.
(NB: SCENE 81 CONTINUES ON PAGE 54)
LEX
Down!
Lex pushes Sebastian to one side as the Predator Disc hurtles past.  It strikes a Predator Statue behind them, cutting through the stone like it were paper.  The head of the Statue comes crashing to the ground.  Neatly decapitated.  The fate that Sebastian narrowly avoided.
Max carries an MP-5 in both hands, firing at an OPTICAL BLUR running across the chamber. Verheiden is also firing, filling the chamber with the deafening SOUND of GUNFIRE.
WEYLAND
The Pyramid! It's shifting again.
LEX
The doors are closing!
SEBASTIAN
Let's get out of here!
The Pyramid has started to reconfigure once more.  Thick stone slabs slide out from the wall, sub-dividing the chamber and splitting the human team into three separate groups.  Each trapped in their own newly created stone cell:
- Max, Weyland, Sebastian and Lex.
- Verheiden and Miller.
- And Connors, all by himself.
INT. pYRAMID - Connors' stone cell
Connors stares up at the walls.  For the moment he is safe from the Predators, but there is no escape from this room.    He's on his own and terrified. He pounds against the walls, screaming at the top of his voice.
Connors
Hello! Help me! Somebody. Get me out of here!
INT. pYRAMID - VERHEIDEN AND miller'S CELL
Connors' cry for help is barely audible. But right now Verheiden and Miller have their own problems.  
Verheiden
What are those things? Did you see what they did to Bass and Stone?  
(snaps his fingers)
I hit that son of a bitch. Dead on. He didn't stop. He didn't slow down. He didn't even flinch.
MilleR
Hey! Verheiden.  
Verheiden
What?
MillER
I'm no soldier, but...I think you should calm down.  We're not dead yet. 
Verheiden
Thanks, professor.
MILLER
Actually, it's Doctor.  And    you're welcome.   
INT. pYRAMID-large cell-MAX/SEBASTIAN/LEX/WEYLAND
Max, Weyland, Lex, and Sebastian are trapped in their own stone cell.  Max and Sebastian ease Bass' dead body to the floor.  His backpack falls off.  Weyland reaches for it and opens the backpack.  The Predator gun within is unharmed.
weYLAND
(relieved)
No damage.
Max glares at him over the body of Bass.  His icy veneer and ferocious loyalty is beginning to crack at last.
max
One of our men is dead.
WEYLAND
I'm sorry, Max.
max 
I need to know what this man died for. 
WEYLAND
He died trying to make history.
MAX
Whose?  Yours?
As the relationship between Weyland and Max holds on by shreds, the team threatening to break apart, Lex and Sebastian exchange deeply concerned looks.    
INT. pYRAMID - Verheiden AND miller'S CELL
The claustrophobia of the cell is eating away at Verheiden.  He's pacing the room, making it seem even smaller. 
Verheiden
We're never going to get out of this place.
(NB: SCENE 85 CONTINUES ON PAGE 56)
miLLER
Don't say that.
Verheiden
Whatever you believe in, you should start praying to it doctor.
Miller looks at him.  He takes charge and tries to calm him.
MILLER
Hey. You have children? 
VERHEIDEN
A son.
MILLER
I have two. You know what that means?  We don't have the luxury of quitting. We're going to make it out of here. You hear me? We are going to survive this if I have to drag you the whole way. 
Verheiden looks at Miller. The nerd has become a leader.
INT. pYRAMID-large cell-MAX/SEBASTIAN/LEX/WEYLAND
LEX
There's no way out back there.
CLOSE ON -- the Pepsi cap that hangs around Sebastian's neck.  He is turning it over and over in his hand nervously as he studies his watch.    
LEX (CONT'D)
Careful...
Sebastian looks up from his watch.
seBASTIAN
What?
LEX
(re: Pepsi cap)
That's a valuable archeological find.
Sebastian smiles at her as the ALARM on his watch GOES OFF.  The sudden SOUND makes them both jump.
LEX (CONT'D)
What is that?
He silences the alarm.
SEBASTIAN
Just a theory.  
In the distance a SOUND like ROLLING THUNDER.  As it gets closer, the noise refines -- it is the sound of stone scraping on stone.
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
The Aztec calendar was metric based on multiples of ten.  I'm guessing that the pyramid reconfigures every ten minutes. 
Weyland and Max get to their feet as a stone slab slides into the roof, revealing a brand new exit from the cell.  The labyrinth awaits. They eye one another, sharing the concern of the unknown that lies ahead.  Then they move one by one as a team.
INT. pYRAMID - Verheiden AND miller'S CELL
SUDDENLY, a stone slab slides back, revealing a brand new chamber duct.  Miller peers into the darkness. 
SCENE 87A. & 88. HAVE BEEN DELETED.
int. PYRAMID - CRAWL SPACE
Miller lowers his head and begins to crouch forward.  The duct is narrow and tight.  It's only a foot or two wider than his shoulders.
mILLER
It would seem that we're rats in a maze.
Verheiden glares at the scientist.  Annoyed that Miller seems to be taking all this better than he is.
miLLER (CONT'D)
Sorry.
INT. PYRAMID - CRAWL SPACE
Connors makes his way through a MAZE of PITCH BLACK ducts.  He too has been released from his stone cell.  He carries a flashlight in one hand, an ice axe in the other.  Every fifty feet the duct splits in two.  A bewildering array of possibilities.  Connors drops his flashlight.  He reaches down to get it and finds it covered in slimy Alien residue. Puzzlement turns to fear on Connors' face.  Connors hears Miller and Verheiden's faint voice. 
conNORS
Hello.  Can you hear me?
miller (V.O.)
Who is that?
CONNORS
It's Connors.  Where are you?
Connors is petrified.  He raises the ice axe, ready to strike.  As Connors rounds a corner, his flashlight ILLUMINATES SOMETHING HORRIFIC!  IT'S STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM BUT WE CAN'T SEE IT!  Connors' face is throttled with shock.  
INT. PYRAMID - CRAWL SPACE
Miller and Verheiden continue to make their way through the pitch black duct.  They hear Connors horrible screaming! 
Verheiden
CONNORS! 
Miller is leading Verheiden through the ducts because the nerd has now become the leader. Suddenly, a trap door opens and Verheiden falls through.
milleR 
Verheiden? Verheiden?
Miller pounds in the area where the trap door grabbed Verheiden.
MILLER (CONT'D)
Verheiden, can you hear me?
Verheiden
Miller! Get me out of here!
MILLER
Hold on.  I'll figure a way to get to you.
InT. pyrAMID - Verheiden's crawl space
Verheiden settles in for a wait.  As he does, he moves his hand back into a pile of skin from an Alien chest burster.  Verheiden is startled as he feels the shredded skin and the slime from the blood.
In a distance down the duct, Verheiden sees A SHADOW OF AN ALIEN.  Keeping his eye on it, he backs up and crouches himself into a corner, which he thinks is safe.  Verheiden turns only to see a SECOND ALIEN waiting right there on top of him.  
INT. PYRAMID - CRAWL SPACE
A moment later, Miller hears Verheiden's horrifying screams.  He knows his friend is dead.  Miller looks up and is snatched by another Alien.  In an instant he is gone.  His torch drops to the floor.
INT. pYRAMID - labyrinth/ FIGHT CHAMBER
Lex, Sebastian, Weyland, and Max make their way through the dark underground maze. Max is ahead on point with his MP-5 machine gun. Lex checks her digital compass.
lEX
If we can stay on this bearing, we should keep going up. If we can do that, we'll make it back to the entrance.
Lex sees that Weyland is struggling, falling further behind. Weyland buckles under the weight of his backpack -- the one containing the Predator Plasma Gun.
LEX (CONT'D)
Leave it. It can only slow us down.
WEYLAND
Too much has been lost to walk away with nothing.
(NB: SCENE 90 CONTINUES ON PAGE 59)
LEX
Give it to me. 
Lex takes the pack from Weyland.  
INT. PYRAMID - FIGHT CHAMBER
Up ahead Max signals the group to halt.  He beams his flashlight into the obscurity just as a PREDATOR emerges from the darkness.  Max begins firing.  But the Predator also shoots.  MATERIALIZING in mid-air before Max is a STEEL NET. It knocks Max off his feet and envelops him.
MAX 
Aaaaaah!
The net is pulling ever tighter around him.  The steel mesh cuts into Max's clothing and equipment, slicing through metal like it were paper.
Weyland struggles with the net, but lacerates his own hands.  The mesh is razor-sharp.  Sebastian tries to cut at the net with a knife, but the blade just snaps against the strength of the Predator steel.
MAX (CONT'D)
Look out!
A SECOND CLOAKED PREDATOR appearing suddenly behind Sebastian and Weyland.  They react, but Max's warning came too late.  Lex and Weyland are sent crashing to the floor.  The Predator grabs Sebastian by the throat and lifts him off the ground, choking the life out of him.  With his other hand, the Predator raises a SPEAR high above Max, ready to finish him off.
Lex reaches for her ice axe that is wrapped around her belt but the first Predator is too fast.  He BACKHANDS Lex, sending her flying through the air.  Lex lands hard.  The wind knocked out of her.  She tries to struggle to her feet, but within seconds the Predator is on her again.  A savage kick sends Lex back to the ground.
Max is held fast in the ever tightening net.  He shares a look with Weyland, only a foot away from him, winded and helpless on the ground.
WEYLAND
MAX!
It's the last words Max hears, as the Predator drives his SPEAR clear through the net.  The force is so great, the spear embeds itself in the rock floor beneath Max.
Lex witnesses Max's death. Sebastian looks to be next in line. He's helpless, being choked to death by the second Predator.  Just moments from losing consciousness.
LEX
Sebastian...
But there's nothing Lex can do.  For she too is about to die.
CLOSE UP: On the twin blades sliding from the first Predator's wrist.  Even in cloaked mode, the razor sharp edges seem to catch the light.  The Predator brings the twin blades up above Lex's head.  She is just seconds from being decapitated.  Lex tenses, ready for the blow.  But it never comes. Instead, the Predator CONVULSES.  Its cloaking device begins to spark, and the Predator starts to become visible.  The sparking spreads out from the Predator's chest as he is LIFTED INTO THE AIR!
Blood drips onto the face of Lex.  Green, luminescent Predator blood.  As the creature hanging above her slowly becomes visible, Lex sees that something has IMPALED the Predator.  A WICKED BARBED TAIL sticks straight through the Predator's chest.
Slowly, an ALIEN unfolds from its hiding place in the ceiling.  It has stabbed the Predator, the sharp point of its TAIL going clean through the Predator's armored chest.
And now the second Predator registers the Alien.  He tosses Sebastian to one side, no longer interested.  He has set his sights on BIG GAME.  As if to mirror the actions of the second Predator, the Alien tosses aside the dead Predator hanging from its tail.
As Sebastian and Lex crawl away, the Predator UNCLOAKS and the two fearsome ALIEN WARRIORS face off.  There is a long moment of tense anticipation, and then the two Creatures CHARGE!  For the first time ever we witness: 
          A PREDATOR AND AN ALIEN GO HEAD TO HEAD!
The two beasts meet with a mighty IMPACT.  The Alien's tail stabs at the Predator.  He deflects it with his twin wrist blades, and they SLICE clean through the tail.  The Alien HOWLS in pain.  The Predator tries to stab the Alien, but the twin blades have been reduced to smoldering stumps by the Alien's acid blood.
Lex and Sebastian pick up Weyland and carry him between them as they make their escape.  In the background, the two mighty beasts grapple, rolling end over end.  The twin mouths of the Alien snap at the Predator's faceplate.  He holds the Alien off, the teeth of the inner mouth barely inches away from his eyes.  The Predator FLINGS the Alien off.  Gaining a moment's grace.  The Alien is clearly stronger than he had ever imagined.  
THE ALIEN charges again. 
THE PREDATOR FIRES A STEEL NET that arcs through the air and envelops the Alien bringing it crashing to the ground.  The net pulls tight, cutting through the Alien's armored hide.  
Int. Pyramid - lower level fight chamber
THE PREDATOR ROARS in triumph.  But as the net cuts through the Alien, the Alien begins to bleed.  And as the Alien bleeds, the net begins to smoke.  The Alien's acid blood is eating through the steel mesh.
SUDDENLY THE ALIEN BREAKS FREE! Its whole body smoking from where the net had cut into it.  The Predator is caught off guard, and the Alien is on him in an instant.
CLOSE ON THE PREDATOR'S FACEPLATE as the Alien holds it tightly between its claws.  The Predator is literally FACE TO FACE with the Alien.  We see the Alien reflected in the mirrored eye sockets of the Predator faceplate.  
THE PREDATOR watches helpless, as the Alien's inner mouth is slowly revealed and then -- the inner mouth punches clean through the Predator's faceplate.  The stone corridor is sprayed with brain matter and luminous green blood. FIRST BLOOD TO THE ALIENS.
INT. pyRAMID staircase
Lex and Sebastian help Weyland climb the stair case.
SEBASTIAN 
What was that thing?
LEX
You tell me ... You're the pyramid expert.    
Now half way up the stairs, Weyland falls to his knees.  He has started to HYPERVENTILATE.  
WEYLAND
I have to stop!
LEX
Take it easy.
But Weyland isn't listening.  He's in full panic.
LEX (CONT'D)
Look at me... 
She grabs Weyland's head in her hands.
LEX (CONT'D)
...you've taken too much air into your lungs.  They're starting to freeze.
Not once does Lex break eye contact with Weyland.
LEX (CONT'D)
You have to control your breathing.  
Slow steady breaths.  Slow... steady ... that's it.
Slowly she talks him down, and Weyland's breathing drops to normal.
WEYLAND
I'm okay... I'm okay.
LEX
Come on.
Lex hauls Weyland to his feet. 
WEYLAND
No.  I can't.
Every word is an effort for Weyland.  The frozen air has wrecked what's left of his lungs.
WEYLAND (CONT'D)
It's hard enough to stand.
Weyland slumps against the wall of the stair case.
LEX
Weyland...
WEYLAND
(interrupting her)
Don't...  
LEX
I'm not letting you die down here.
WEYLAND
You didn't  Lex. Go. I'll buy you whatever time I can.
At the bottom of the stairs, A LOOMING SHADOW appears, humanoid in shape.  A PREDATOR.  Weyland sees him and grabs his ice axe and holds it like a weapon.  Weyland walks down the stairs to fight the Predator.
SEBASTIAN
There's another one!  We have to go!  Now!
weyLAND
Go!  
Lex and Sebastian see the Predator at the bottom of the stairs.  Lex looks at Weyland. His look conveys the sacrifice he's about to make. 
WEYLAND (CONT'D)
Run!
Sebastian pulls Lex away.  She exchanges one last look with Weyland as they run up the stairs. 
Below:  Human and Predator face off.  Weyland draws himself up to his full height.  He's going out with a fight.  Weyland swings at Scar.  Scar catches the ice axe and crumples it in his fist.  PREDATOR VISION:  Scar sees Weyland in his distinctive heat signature vision.  Like an MRI, the Predator vision scans over Weyland's wrecked body, a body riddled with disease.  Like stars in the sky, the tumors are everywhere. The cancer has destroyed Weyland.
Scar turns away from Weyland and walks up the stairs.  To Scar, he's nothing but a sick animal.  Weyland is not worthy of the hunt.
WEYLAND (CONT'D)
Don't turn your back on me!
But Scar pays no heed.  Weyland sees that Scar is heading up the stairs after Lex and Sebastian.  He feverishly reaches inside his coat, produces his oxygen bottle and an emergency flare.
Weyland opens the valve to the oxygen bottle and lights the flare.  The gas immediately ignites and the resulting jet of flame engulfs the Predator. The Predator SCREAMS.
Still burning, Scar turns back to Weyland and kills him with his spear.  Weyland dies a hero's death.  The Predator ROARS in triumph.
INT. PYRAMID - CoRRIdor
Lex and Sebastian exit the labyrinth.  They hear the Predator's victory cry.  Lex stops.
lex
Weyland!
sebastian
You can't help him.
He drags her away.
Sebastian (CONT'D)
We have to go.
INT. pYRAMID - chamber of pillar
They race into a vast chamber filled with rough hewn stone PILLARS and STATUES.  The chamber is inky dark, but the pillars make it hard to see too far ahead.  Anything could be hiding in here.  
Lex looks at her digital wrist compass.
LEX 
We keep moving and stay on the heading. We keep it together. Make it to the surface. 
PREDATOR VISION: Watching the humans move between the pillars.  But Sebastian and Lex are not what the Predator is interested in.  He zooms in until the Predator GUN in Lex's backpack FILLS THE FRAME.  This is what he wants.
What the predator hears:
... keep ... it ... gether ... mak ... face ...
He is processing Lex's voice.
WHAT THE PREDATOR HEARS: (CONT'D)
Keep ... it ... together ... make ... to ... th ... face ...
Until he perfects it --
WHAT THE PREDATOR HEARS: (CONT'D)
Keep ... it ... together ... make ... it ... to ... the ... surface.
ANGLE ON SEBASTIAN --
The digital ALARM GOES OFF again on SEBASTIAN'S WATCH.
SEBASTIAN 
It's moving!
LEX POV:  The stone walls have begun to reconfigure again.
sEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Through here!
A HEAVY STONE SLAB is RISING FROM THE FLOOR, closing off the doorway ahead of them.  
sebastian (CONT'D)
Hurry!
Sebastian helps Lex through the doorway.  But by the time she is safe, he has to JUMP UP and haul himself onto the slab.  Sebastian scrambles across the top of the stone slab seconds before it seals completely.  He just missed being crushed against the roof. 
Just when we think the danger is over, and right before the slab completely seals the doorway, a Predator throwing disc cuts across the room narrowly missing Lex and Sebastian.  The disc slams into the stone of the chamber, causing sparks to spray everywhere. 
ANGLE ON PREDATOR --
As he appears from the shadows.  He stares at the solid stone slab blocking the doorway.  For the moment he has lost his prey.
BEHIND THE PREDATOR --
UNKNOWN POV: Watching the Predator.
The Pred senses something, turns to look at it.  Reveal:
IT'S AN ALIEN FACE HUGGER and it leaps for him...  The Pred unleashes a THROWING DISC at the Face Hugger in mid-air and slices it in half.  
But the danger is not over, for behind the Pred, unfolding from the pillar DIRECTLY BEHIND him is a fully grown ALIEN, jaws wide, ready to strike.  
It has been there all along.  Perfectly camouflaged.  This new Alien rears up behind the Pred.  Ready to strike.
The Pred looks like he's toast, but AT THE LAST SECOND he  CATCHES the returning throwing disc, spins around and in best SAMURAI STYLE lops the Alien's head clean off.
INT. pYRAMID - hieroglyphics Chamber - cONTINUOUS
Lex picks herself up from the floor. The walls and ceiling of this chamber are covered in hieroglyphics.  This is an ancient library of some kind.  They are trapped here.  Both ends of the chamber are sealed off by heavy slabs of rock that are impossible to move.
SEBASTIAN (O.S.) 
Look.  Over here.
A dozen small peepholes have been cut in one of the walls.  They afford a GLIMPSE into the Chamber of Pillar from which they have just escaped.  Lex joins Sebastian at one of the peepholes.
INT. PYRAMID - CHAMBER OF PILLAR
LEX/SEBASTIAN POV:  The Predator stands over the dead Alien  Face Hugger. Using a CEREMONIAL KNIFE, the Predator cuts off one of the Alien's fingers.  Then the Predator removes his armored visor, revealing his hideous crab-like face.  Using the severed Alien finger like a crayon, the Predator traces a Predator warrior insignia on the forehead of the armored visor.  The acid blood leaking from the finger etches the Predator warrior insignia into the metal.  Sebastian studies the Predator.
SEBASTIAN
He's "blooding" himself.  
Then the Predator marks the same insignia on his OWN FOREHEAD.  The Alien blood SEARS into his flesh.  The Predator cries out.  A mixture of pain, but also pride.  
INT. pYRAMID - hieroglyphics Chamber (RESUMED)
LEX
What?
SEBASTIAN 
Ancient tribal warriors would mark themselves with the blood of their kill. It's a rite of passage.  A sign that they've become a man.
Sebastian and Lex jump down from the wall. He begins to scan the hieroglyphics.
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
This is starting to make sense.
Int. PYRAMID - chamber of pillar
SCAR without the eyes of Lex or Sebastian on him, drops the Alien finger to the ground.  Blood spills out, burning through the ground.  
UNSEEN BEHIND HIM a second Alien Face Hugger appears.  It rears up, ready to strike.
Int. PYRAMID - CRAWL SPACE
The duct opens up into a larger chamber.  Miller crawls out and stands.  He slowly moves into...
SCENE 92C. HAS BEEN DELETED.
INT. pyRAMID staircase
...the staircase.  Miller sees something, walks over to it.  It's Weyland's dead body.
High Angle looking down on Miller in the foreground something moves.  High up in the chamber above the staircase are Aliens preparing to attack the unsuspecting scientist.
SCENE 93. HAS BEEN DELETED.
INT. pYRAMID - hIEROGLYPHICS CHAMBER
Sebastian pores over the hieroglyphics carved into the walls and the floor.
SEBASTIAN
I think this is a manhood ritual of some kind. The humanoid ones, they've been sent here to prove that they are worthy to become adults.
LeX
You're saying they're what --teenagers? 
SEBASTIAN
Who knows how long these creatures live.  Perhaps for thousands of years.  However old they are, this is their rite of passage. 
He traces a hand over the hieroglyphics.
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
That's why they didn't carry those guns with them to begin with.  They had to earn them.  Like a knight earning his spurs.  The glyphs are a little difficult to make out but the story's all here. 
Flashback: earth - 5,000 years ago
The blue green planet seen from space.  A Predator spacecraft approaches for the very first time.
SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
Thousands of years ago these hunters found a backwater planet.
EXT. primitive settlement - night  
A bright light descends from the sky and night becomes day.  PRIMITIVE MEN and WOMEN emerge from their hovels to stare up at the heavens in amazement and fear.
SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
They taught humans how to build  and were worshiped as Gods... 
EXT. pYRAMID. Day.
Four great Pyramids are under construction.  Directly above each hovers a Predator Spacecraft.  It's a stunning image.
In the foreground, on the steps of the first Pyramid, primitive TRIBAL CHIEFS prostrate themselves before their "Gods".
SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
Every hundred years the Gods would return ... And when they did, they would expect a sacrifice ....
INT. pYRAMID - sACRIFICIAL CHAMBER
Chosen sacrificial VICTIMS are anointed by TRIBAL PRIESTS.  As the Victims lay back willingly on the sacrificial stones, an ALIEN EGG is revealed at the foot of each slab.
CLOSE ON ONE EGG as it begins to open and the spider legs of a FACE HUGGER start to emerge.
SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
Humans were used to breed the ultimate prey.   
CLOSE ON ONE OF THE VICTIMS as he convulses on the sacrificial slab.  The skin of his chest begins to distend.  Something is forcing its way out.
SEBASTIAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
The Hunters would battle these Great Serpents ...
EXT. pYRAMID - Night  
The Predator stands atop the Pyramid.  He holds the head of the Alien aloft.  He is triumphant.  Above him, a Predator Spacecraft descends through the electrical storm. 
SEBASTIAN
To prove themselves worthy to return home to the stars.
EXT. another pyramid - ANOTHER Night
The top of the Pyramid.  Three Predators in a defensive formation, fighting back-to-back.  The CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal dozens of Aliens, circling and attacking.  The CAMERA CONTINUES to PULL BACK, revealing even more Aliens pouring up the steps of the Pyramid to attack.  Hundreds of them.  Perhaps thousands.  The Pyramid is alive with Aliens, like some giant anthill.  
SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
But if the Hunters lost ... They made sure that nothing survived.  Total genocide. 
Just at the moment when the Predators are about to be overwhelmed, they activate their SELF DESTRUCT mechanism.  A powerful shockwave sweeps across the pyramids, vaporizing everything in its path.  Scattering Aliens before it, blowing them limb from limb.  Like a miniature atomic bomb
SEBASTIAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
An entire civilization wiped out overnight. 
The searing white light of the explosion OBLITERATES the image --
CUT BACK TO: 
INT. pYRAMID - hIEROGLYPHICS CHAMBER (present)
Sebastian looks up from the hieroglyphics.
LEX
So the humanoids, the hunters, they brought those creatures here to hunt?
SEBASTIAN
And they use us like cattle.  We're  hosts for them to breed in. 
LEX
So we didn't discover them. 
SEBASTIAN
No. The heat bloom was designed to lure us down here.  This whole thing was a trap.  Without us there could be no hunt.
INT. pyRAMID - sacRIFICIAL CHAMBER
TIGHT ON MILLER'S EYES as he wakes up.  He doesn't know where he is.  In horror, Miller realizes he has been cocooned next to Verheiden and Connors.  Connors is dead, with his rib cage already bent outward.  Verheiden is barely alive with a face hugger attached to him.  The tail is tightening around his throat.  Verheiden's cocooned body is right beside Miller.  Protruding from Verheiden's cocooned body is his shoulder holster that contains his pistol.  
Pull back to reveal an egg cracking with a Face Hugger inside.  Miller has just a few seconds. 
Miller reaches for Verheiden's gun but he's virtually frozen in place, trapped in the cocoon.  He struggles, fighting desperately to get to Verheiden's gun.  The face hugger is almost out. Miller can't quite reach it.  His only chance is just inches away from his fingertips. 
MiLLER
Verheiden!!!
Miller sees that the face hugger is almost free.  Miller summons all his strength, fighting to get out.  He grabs the gun just as the ALIEN FACE HUGGER LEAPS for him.  It's too late.  Miller is dead for sure.  One second too late.  But then somehow he gets a shot off at the last possible second that hits the Alien face hugger squarely.  The Alien face hugger falls to the ground, still twitching.  Miller shoots it three more times killing it.  Our favorite nerd is a hero! 
miLLER (CONT'D)
Score one for the beakers! 
Miller's adrenaline rush is assassinated by fear as we pull back to reveal: A FIELD OF ALIEN EGGS surrounding Miller on all sides. And now he sees them.  One by one the eggs begin to open. Miller holds his gun in hand ready to fight, but his face shows the acceptance of impending death. 
EXT. sacRIFICIAL CORRIDOR
Just outside the Sacrificial Chamber we hear a few quick gun shots.  Then nothing.  And we know Miller went down fighting.
INT. pYRAMID - hIEROGLYPHICS CHAMBER
(INTERCUT WITH INT. CHAMBER OF PILLAR)
Lex returns to spy through one of the peepholes into the Chamber of Pillar.
LEX POV: THE PREDATOR (SCAR) is gone.  Where is he?  Suddenly the Predator is looking at her through the same peephole, his eye an inch from hers.  
LEX jumps back in terror.  
LEX POV: The Predator with the Predator warrior insignia on his forehead is putting his face plate back on.  The face plate is marked with a similar Predator warrior insignia.  From now on, this Predator will be known as SCAR.  Around his neck hangs the INNER MOUTH of the Alien he slew.  He wears it as a trophy.
SCAR stands calmly facing the doorway to the Hieroglyphics Chamber.  He's waiting for the pyramid to reconfigure once more and the stone slab blocking the doorway to move.
LEX
He's right behind that rock. Waiting for the door to open.  
seBASTIAN
I think when we took the guns we upset the order of how things work down here.  We tipped the scales.
LEX
(getting it)
He needs his gun back.
Sebastian points to the slab that Scar is behind.
seBASTIAN 
When that door opens we're dead.  
LEX
Not if we set things right.
SEBASTIAN
What?
LEX
This pyramid, it's like a prison. We took the guard's guns and now the prisoners are running free. To restore order, the guards need their guns.
Sebastian just looks at her, more terrified than before.
SEBASTIAN
Don't ever use that metaphor again.
lEX 
When the door opens we're going to give that thing his gun back.
SEBASTIAN 
Are you crazy? You want a metaphor? During a big game hunt, the animals being hunted don't arm the hunters! 
LEX
They're not hunting us. We're in the middle of a war. It's time to pick a side. 
SEBASTIAN
We're on our side.
LEX
We have to consider the possibility that we might not make it out of here. 
Sebastian looks at her.
LEX (CONT'D)
But we have to make sure that those "serpents" don't reach the surface -- because if they do -- everything, everywhere, could die.
Sebastian speaks slowly, not believing his own words.
sebASTIAN
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
The ALARM on Sebastian's watch GOES OFF.  In the distance a SOUND like ROLLING THUNDER.  The pyramid is reconfiguring once again.  Lex nods to the heavy slab blocking the doorway in front of them, the one Scar is behind.  
But as the pyramid reconfigures, that's not the door that opens. The one holding Scar back remains sealed while another door opens up into a corridor where heading off to the left are the small strobe lights that Lex dropped earlier marking their path to the surface, and heading off to the right is total darkness.  
Sebastian looks at the strobe lights stretching out into the distance. He locks eyes with Lex. She sighs nervously.
LEX
Let's go find our friend.
And Lex and Sebastian turns right, toward the darkness and the unknown.
Scene 102. Has been deleted.
THERE IS NO SCENE NUMBER 103.
INT. pYRAMID - lABYRINTH
Lex and Sebastian are back in the maze of stone corridors.  Running through the semi-darkness.  Around any corner could be a Predator. On any ceiling could be an Alien.  They move quickly but cautiously.  Frightened. Prepared for anything.
LEX
How do you say scared shitless in Italian?
seBASTIAN
You know, there was a point I really liked you. 
Shockingly sudden: Lex sees an Alien move ahead of them, blocking their way.  Lex and Sebastian turn and run down another corridor as the horrible shadow of an approaching Alien can be seen behind them.
Int. LABYRINTH - chasm
A DEEP CHASM spanning the corridor.  It is over fifteen feet wide.  Lex and Sebastian see the chasm.  They turn back to see the shadow of the Alien behind them.
(NB: SCENE 104A CONTINUES ON PAGE 74)
sebastian 
We're gonna have to jump it.
She nods. The fact that there's no other way doesn't make it any better. They step back to get a running start. Lex and Sebastian attempt the impossible jump side by side but Sebastian's slightly taller body is ahead of Lex and he lands first on the far side.  The edge of the ledge Sebastian lands on begins to give way from the weight of his impact.  
Lex lands a second later but because of the weakened ledge, the edge Lex lands on gives way.  Lex almost makes it. Almost.  She hits the wall on the far side of the chasm.  The impact smashes her ribs she grimaces in pain.  But she manages to hang onto the ledge above her.  
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Hang on!
Sebastian reaches down and grabs Lex with his right hand, stopping her from falling.  
seBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Hang on!
He holds her there and begins to pull her up.  Suddenly Lex's face fills with terror.  Sebastian just looks at her.  
seBASTIAN (CONT'D)
What?
LEX POV: Unfolding from the shadows is a fully grown ALIEN! 
CLOSE ON SEBASTIAN as he is SNATCHED by the Alien and violently yanked into the air.  Lex is horrified.
LEX 
SEBASTIAN!
Lex doesn't even get a second to mourn as Sebastian is yanked upward, his grip on her hand is pulled away and--
LEX almost falls but she manages to hang on and pull herself over the edge.  Lex takes a moment to absorb what she has just witnessed, knowing full well what is in store for Sebastian.  She lies on the ground, bruised and heartbroken.  
CLOSE ON THE BOTTLE CAP:  The Pepsi cap that Sebastian wears around his neck.  It falls in SLOW MOTION right past Lex.
scene number 105. Has been deleted.
INT. pYRAMID - lABYRINTH - long corridor
Lex is back in the darkened maze of stone corridors.  She only has the pocket flashlight for illumination, and the battery is giving out.  It's getting very dark, and she's getting very disoriented.  She looks down at her digital wrist compass, but it has been smashed in the fall.  It's useless.
LEX
Damn it!
She's hopelessly lost. 
INT. pYRAMID - lABYRINTH - dead end chamber
Lex makes a wrong turn and finds herself in a dead end corridor.  She turns around and stops in her tracks.
Standing at the other end of the corridor, blocking her escape, is Scar.  He holds a short metal tube in one hand.  Suddenly both ends of the tube TELESCOPE out to form the Predator SPEAR.  
LEX refuses to show fear.  It's a brave effort but an unsuccessful one. She's terrified. And he knows it.
SCAR'S PREDATOR VISION:  Lex outlined in distinctive heat signature.  ZOOM IN on her backpack, to reveal the outline of a Predator gun within.  This is what Scar wants.
lEX
(to herself; a mantra)
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.  The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
She repeats Sebastian's words over and over again softly, trying to convince herself or prepare herself to do the unthinkable.
Without ever taking her eyes off Scar, Lex slowly takes off her backpack.  She  holds it in her hand as Scar watches her. Lex slides the gun across the floor.  Scar picks it up. A beat. Then something suddenly moves behind him.  
An ALIEN, just about to strike.  Scar senses the movement just in time but he hasn't had enough time to mount his gun.  He turns and brings his spear up in defense.  The Alien has the upper hand however, and SLAMS Scar to the ground.  Scar loses his grip on the spear and it slides across the floor toward Lex.  
THE ALIEN pressing its advantage.  The inner mouth snaps at Scar's face.  Just inches away.  Scar rolls backwards, using the Alien's own weight against it.  A classic judo move.  The Alien flies over Scar and crashes into the wall beside Lex!
Lex gets her hands on the Predator spear just as the Alien rights itself.  Without hesitation the Alien leaps at the nearest prey, Lex.
LEX AND THE FIRST ALIEN.  A Frozen Tableau, rendered in EXTREME SLOW MOTION.  The Alien caught mid-flight, leaping through the air toward Lex.  Lex bringing up the Predator spear in defense.  It's an epic moment.  Suddenly, the image returns to NORMAL TIME, and the Alien completes its flight with terrifying speed.  The force and impact of the Alien is its undoing however, for it IMPALES itself on the spear.
Lex struggles to keep hold of the spear.  She leans back, hoisting the impaled Alien into the air.  The Alien refuses to die, however.  Its own body weight is causing it to slide down the spear toward Lex!  Every second, the snapping jaws of the creature drop closer to Lex's exposed face.
THE ALIEN impaled on the spear finally dies.  His jaws barely an inch from Lex's face.  
CLOSE ON LEX'S FOREHEAD as the three red dots of the laser sighting system appear on her face.  She looks up to see Scar pointing the gun straight at her.  There is a tense moment between the Human and the Predator.  Then the three red dots slowly move off her face to the real target, behind her.
InT. pyRAMID - lABYRINTH - long corridor
PREDATOR POV:  Behind Lex are four Aliens, led by Grid, closing in for the kill.  She's mesmerized by the Aliens.  They seem to flow over the ceiling, the walls, the floor. Scar shoots an Alien, vaporizing it.  They scatter as they see Scar shooting his gun with complete precision and accuracy.  The Aliens have retreated for now.  The room is empty.
INT. pYRAMID - Alien qUEEN'S CHAMBER
The Alien Queen is forced to watch another batch of her eggs taken away from her by the automated conveyor belt.  The Alien Queen is going berserk, fighting against her chains, but to no avail.  She lets out a piercing SHRIEK that ECHOES through the Pyramid.  
Int. Pyramid - labYRINTH - long corridor
Scar and Lex stand looking at one another. 
INT. PYRAMID - LABYRINTH - LONG CORRIDOR
ANGLE ON: Grid and the Aliens are watching from the shadows, laying in wait.  Slowly we move into Scar's shoulder gun.  It's the only thing keeping Lex and Scar from being ripped apart.  For now.
CLOSE ON GRID as the leader of the Alien pack suddenly turns.  Grid has heard his mother's anguished cry for help.  
int. Pyramid - labyrinth - dead end chamber
Scar moves in and looks Lex over carefully.  He could kill her in an instant and she knows it.  He looks at her strangely.  She stands there, terrified and defiant.  And then he walks away, leaving her there.
lEX 
Hey!  Hey!   
She runs up to him. She grabs him. He turns sharply. 
LEX (CONT'D)
I'm coming with you.  You hear me you ugly son of a bitch?  I'm coming with you.
Scar looks at Lex. And Lex does the most surprising thing.  She simply opens her hand.  Scar looks at this young warrior, wanting to fight, her hand outstretched and open.  And Scar places a knife in Lex's hand.  
Scar wastes no time.  He takes his SACRIFICIAL DAGGER and begins to cut up the body of the dead Alien.  
(NB: SCENE 108 CONTINUES ON PAGE 77)
Prising the armored hide away from its internal organs. Scar works with speed and precision. Lex is both intrigued and repelled.
LEX (CONT'D)
What are you doing?  
Scar pulls the armored head plate of the Alien away from the rest of its body.  He lays it carefully to one side.  It is now completely hollow, like an empty shell. Lex can see that the long twisted BRAIN of the Alien is still pulsing and twitching.  Even dead like this, the Alien is amazingly menacing. After all, how do you really know when an Alien is dead? Lex leans in for a closer look and -- WHAM!!! A claw snatches at her face.  
Lex jumps back terrified.  But the Alien makes no further movement.  Maybe it was some kind of reflex action?  Lex looks from the Alien to Scar.  The Predator holds his dagger over the brain of the dead beast.  He prods a lobe of the Alien's brain and the same claw snatches at the air.  He scared her deliberately.  A Predator joke.  Lex manages a half smile-- more spooked than funny -- that's...great. Scar returns to his work.
LEX (CONT'D)
(firm)
What are you doing?
Lex puts a hand on Scar's arm, stopping his work.  Scar stares up at her.  Clearly not used to being touched.  A tense moment.  For a second, it looks like the Predator may tear Lex in half, but then he grabs Lex's spear.  Scar dips the tip of his sacrificial blade in the body of the Alien.  Then, holding the blade above the handle of her spear, he lets a drop of Alien blood fall.  The acid blood immediately begins to eat its way through the handle of the spear.  
Next, Scar holds the blade above the long piece of Alien hide that he has just torn from the dead creature's body.  Scar lets a drop of Alien blood fall.  The acid blood rolls harmlessly off the Alien hide, like it were just a drop of water.  The acid doesn't react with the Alien's own armor.
Scar looks up at Lex, as if to say - "Get it?"  Lex nods.
Scar
(distorted version of Lex's voice)
Keep it together ...
Lex is amazed.  Scar speaks -- and in her own voice.
LEX 
Deal.

there are no scene numbers 110, 111 & 112.
INT. pYRAMID - lABYRINTH - LONG CORRIDOR
Lex and Scar stand side-by-side. Two warriors ready for battle! Lex is wearing the armored plates cut from the Alien for protection.  Lex carries a shield fashioned from the head of the Alien.  Scar carries his Predator spear and plasma gun and Lex holds the coolest knife you've ever seen -- made from the razor sharp barbs of an Alien's tail. 
LEX
(almost sensing the Aliens)
They're close ...
Lex and Scar share a long look. Together, they make a fearsome sight. She nods. He nods. And the two warriors begin the hunt. 
iNT. pYRAMID - Alien qUEEN'S CHAMBER
The Alien Queen hangs from her chains, a prisoner.  Slowly, dark figures emerge from the shadows of the chamber.  Aliens, her children.  Led by Grid.  They almost seem to bow in supplication to the Alien Queen.  
INT. pyRAMID - saCRIFICIAL CHAMBER
Predator and Human run side by side.  Scar is clearly starting to accept Lex as something of an equal.  Lex slows and then halts.  Something on the ground catches Lex's eyes.  It's Miller's camera and it's laying on the ground, covered in blood.  Lex kneels to pick the camera up.  She holds it in her hands, slowly wiping the blood away.  Lex flips through a few of the digital photos that Miller has taken on this trip.  The last photo Lex stares at is the one that he showed her on the helicopter: Miller standing arm in arm with his two sons.  
LEX
Miller!
But there is no reply.  
LEX (CONT'D)
Miller!
Lex stands and stares into the darkness.  She shines her flashlight, piercing the darkness to find in horror the THREE COCOONS that hold the dead bodies of Miller, Verheiden and Connors.  What's left of their rib cages are already bent outward.  The Chest Bursters long gone.  Verheiden's, Miller's and Connors' faces are all frozen in a grotesque rictus.  Lex mourns and kneels down by their bodies and finds Miller's handgun.  She studies the gun as she hears something.
It's very faint.  A ghostly ECHO.  At first, she can't make it out.  But then, to her horror, Lex realizes what it is -- Her name.  Repeated over and over.
EchOING VOICE
Lex... 
It is coming from a cluster of stone statues close by.
ECHOING VOICE (CONT'D)
Lex...
Lex advances on the statues.  Eyes straining to see in the half light of the chamber.
ECHOING VOICE (CONT'D)
... help me ...
Up ahead there is one statue in particular.  Some kind of grotesque beast.  It seems impossible, but the voice seems to be coming from this statue.
ECHOING VOICE (CONT'D)
... help me, Lex ...
Lex draws closer, and only now does the horrific truth become clear.  What Lex thought was a statue is alive.  And what she thought was a beast, is a man -- Sebastian.  The Alien had not killed him, but instead, encased him in some kind of monstrous ALIEN COCOON.  
LEX
Sebastian!
Sebastian is held tight in the cocoon.  In front of him an EMPTY Alien Egg.  He's clearly in a lot of pain.
LEX (CONT'D)
I'll get you out of here.
SEBASTIAN
NO!  Lex, it's too late.  You have to stop these things!  
(NB: SCENE 113A CONTINUES ON PAGE 81)
Sebastian screams in agony. 
seBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Lex... they... can't... reach... the surface. 
Lex nods slowly.
LEX
I know.
His skin is starting to stretch tight.  An Alien Chest Burster is about to break free.  Without hesitation, Scar targets his weapon.  The three red dots of the laser sighting system appear on Sebastian.  
LEX (CONT'D)
No!
She blocks Scar's shot.
LEX (CONT'D)
No ...
Behind her, Sebastian SCREAMS again.  Lex turns to face him, tears in her eyes.  She brings up Miller's handgun.
SEBASTIAN
Do it.
She can see it in his eyes -- death would be a mercy.
LEX
I'm sorry.
Lex closes her eyes and makes the impossible and unthinkable choice to fire.  Her gun racks back as she just fired the last bullet.  And we HOLD ON her eyes, experiencing the horror of this moment entirely from her tortured perspective. Sebastian's agonized screaming comes to an abrupt end.
Scar watches her closely.  From his reaction, he appears to respect her more and more with every decision she makes.  
(NB: SCENE 113A CONTINUES ON PAGE 82)
SCAR'S PREDATOR VISION:  We see Sebastian's dead body slumped on the floor.  His body begins to convulse.  Sebastian's skin begins to distend.  
THE ALIEN CHEST BURSTER leaps through the air.  With lightening-fast reflexes, Scar catches it.  
CLOSE ON SCAR as he holds the newly born Alien up to his face.  He turns it in his hand, examining it.  
CLOSE ON THE ALIEN.  Its teeth snapping at Scar's face.  Unbelievably vicious.  Then in one simple move, Scar casually SNAPS its neck between his fingers.  Just like it were a matchstick.
iNT. pYRAMID - Alien qUEEN'S CHAMBER
Grid and the rest of her children LEAP upon their mother.  Their claws and mouths TEARING at her flesh in a frenzied attack.  The Alien Queen begins to bleed.  Her hissing, burning blood flying everywhere.  Her acid blood begins to eat through the chains.  And only now do we realize what the Aliens are doing --  
They are not trying to kill their mother, they are trying to free her!  
The Alien Queen SHRIEKS both in pain and triumph.  The grotesque, terrifying SOUND ECHOES through every chamber and corridor in the Pyramid.
INT. pyRAMID - saCRIFICIAL CHAMBER
Scar hears the Queen's blood-curdling SCREAM as it echoes through the entire pyramid.
lEX
What was that? 
Lex witnesses a first -- a scared Predator.
Scar
(in Lex's own voice)
Keep it together.  Make it to the surface.
LEX
Wait. We can't let these things get out of here. 
Scar presses several buttons on his wrist computer.  There are several loud BEEPS.  A cluster of predator symbols instantly appear on the wrist computer.   
Scar shows it to Lex.  She shakes her head.  
lEX (CONT'D)
I don't understand.   
He points to the wrist computer.
Scar makes a tight fist with the hand that the wrist computer is on.  Then uses the opposite hand to point to the wrist computer. Then Scar slowly unfurls his fist indicating an explosion.  
LEX (CONT'D)
That thing is a bomb?  
(no answer)
It's a bomb?
Scar looks at her and unfurls his hand again.  She nods, understanding Scar's plan completely. He looks at his wrist computer and activates the countdown.  He removes the wrist computer/bomb from his wrist.  He holds it in his hand--  
lEX (CONT'D)
Well, I hope it kills every fucking one of them.
Scar throws it deep into the chamber. 
SCAR 
Keep it together... Make it to the surface.
And Scar leads Lex out, leaving the wrist computer behind as it begins to count down.  She follows behind Scar as they race through the darkened maze.  The pace is brutal.  
iNT. pYRAMID - Alien qUEEN'S CHAMBER
The first of the Alien Queen's limbs break free from the weakened chains.  Then another, then another.   The Alien Queen, wounded but magnificent, drops to the floor of the chamber.  Free at last.

int. pyrAMID - LABYRINTH - corridor
Lex is doing her best just to keep up.  Scar stops at an intersection.  He seems uncertain for a moment, then he heads to the right.
LEX 
No!  
Lex has stopped at the intersection.  She isn't following.
LEX (CONT'D)
This way.
She heads to the left.  Stepping over one of the sTROBE LIGHTS she left earlier -- her path back to the surface.  After a moment, Scar follows the Human.
INT. pYRAMID - eNTRANCE CHAMBER
Lex and Scar still running.  Lex can see a pinprick of light in the distance -- the entrance to the Pyramid.
INT. pYRAMID - lABYRINTH
Aliens, racing through the darkness.  Barely glimpsed in the half light.  Grid is at their head.  And behind the Pack, wrapped in darkness, something huge and monstrous --
THE ALIEN QUEEN.

ext. pyramid steps
Lex and Scar emerge from the Pyramid and race toward the mouth of the tunnel - their escape route back to the surface.
int. ice grOTTO
Lex looks back. There is no sign of Aliens behind them.  They are safe for now. She finds herself face to face with Quinn.
She almost screams in surprise.  Quinn's body is frozen solid at the foot of the ice tunnel.  
Shaking off the surprise, Lex sees that one of the large equipment cases is still fastened to the automated winch and pulley system.  Lex rips the top of the case off and flings it away.  The empty case has been converted to a SLED.  Lex grabs the control box for the automated winch, but it is covered in Alien slime.  She glances up the tunnel.  Far above, something is moving.  Headed for the surface.  Lex turns back to Scar.
LEX
Get in!
But as Scar turns, an Alien claw cuts into his shoulder smashing his plasma gun!  AN ALIEN HAS MATERIALIZED OUT OF NO WHERE.  THE ALIEN is hunched over Scar's back. A blur of teeth and claws.  Lex sees the PITON GUN on the sled.    
(NB: SCENE 122 CONTINUES AFTER SCENE 122A ON PAGE 85)  
Int. Sacrificial chamber
The wrist computer bomb continues ticking down -- there's almost no time left.
int. ice grOTTO (resumeD)
Lex grabs the piton and shoves it into the Alien's mouth.  
leX 
You are one ugly motherfu...
And she pulls the trigger and blows the back of his head off.  
A second Alien, "Grid" appears and rushes the sled.  Grid smashes the piton gun.  Scar reaches for his throwing disc and drives it into Grid's crown, wounding him badly.  Acid blood pours from Grid's wounds, splashing Scar and burning through Scar's armor.  Scar's wounds are brutal but not deadly.  
Grid and Scar are locked in deadly combat.  Grid is clawing at Scar, with blow after pounding blow.  Scar throws Grid back against the wall of ice.  
Lex grabs Scar and they tumble back into the sled together.
EXT. mOUTH OF THE TUNNEL - cONTINUOUS
2,000 feet above, the digital readout on the automated winch suddenly changes to -- EMERGENCY RELEASE ACTIVATED.  The digital counter reads 3 ... 2 ... 1.  And then the COUNTERWEIGHT is released.
INT. iCE GROTTO - 2,ooo feet below - coNTINUOUS
Even with the weight of Scar and Lex, the sled is still much lighter than when loaded with equipment.  The result -- instead of a slow, steady rise to the surface, the sled takes off like an Express Elevator out of Hell.  Literally snatching Scar and Lex from the clutches of the Aliens.
INT. tUNNEL - cONTINUOUS
The speed with which they ascend is incredible.  The breath is knocked out of them.  Lex can barely speak --
LEX
Hold on ...
EXT. mOUTH OF THE TUNNEL - pERPETUAL TWILIGHT
The sled leaps from the tunnel.  Smashing into the winch rig with a MASSIVE IMPACT.  Scar and Lex are thrown clear.
Lex lands HARD in the snow but she is oblivious.  She has been knocked unconscious by the impact.
On the surface, the katabatic storm has blown itself out to be replaced by a heavy sea mist.  The mist reduces visibility to no more than a hundred and fifty feet.  The dark buildings of the whaling station loom menacingly out of the gloom.
INT. TUNNEL
Far below, but with surprising speed, the Alien Queen is ascending the tunnel.  Razor sharp claws cutting into the ice, giving her purchase.  And clambering over her, even riding on top of her, are her children. Leading the hungry pack of ravenous aliens is GRID!

Scar helps the groggy Lex to her feet.  He pushes her on, running through the whaling station.  
Int. SacrifiCIAL CHAMBER
The final seconds of the bomb tick away....
EXT. MOUTH OF THE TUNNEL
Behind them, Grid appears at the mouth of the tunnel.  
CLOSE ON GRID.  He is the first Alien to reach the surface.  He HOWLS for Scar's blood.  This has been a personal grudge match between the two of them.  He is about to leap forward when suddenly --
INT. saCRIFICIAL CHAMBER
The SCREEN WHITES OUT as the Predator Bomb finally explodes.
INT. TUNNEL
The blast wave from the Predator Bomb hurtles up the tunnel.
EXT. MOUTH OF THE TUNNEL
The snow around Grid's feet vibrates with the force of the coming explosion.  Grid turns back to look down the tunnel.  The growing fireball is reflected in the shiny opaque dome of his head.  Grid has only a moment to try and turn away before the fireball hits him with full force.  He is BLOWN TO PIECES.
EXT. whaling station
The massive fireball sweeps across the whaling station, setting buildings alight and throwing a rain of flaming debris into the night sky.  The force of the explosion throws Lex and Scar to their knees.  
AERIAL SHOT OF RAZORBACK POINT
A GIANT SHOCKWAVE shudders through the snow, AND THEN THE GROUND BEGINS TO GIVE WAY!  The ice cave and Pyramid beneath Razorback Point have started to collapse, taking a huge chunk of the mountain range with it.  The mountain peak directly above the pyramid is sucked down into the bowels of the Earth.  
EXT. wHALING STATION - cONTINUOUS
The collapse of Razorback Point is spreading outward, like ripples in a pond.  It is starting to consume the whaling station.  Building after building is sucked into the abyss.  The drilling rigs, the base camp, are all quickly swallowed from view.  As buildings collapse all around them, Scar forces Lex from her knees and they begin to run once more.  The snow and ice at their feet starts to CRACK and give way.  No matter how fast they run however, the cracks are already spreading ahead of them.
Then the very ground beneath their feet begins to give way.
Scar and Lex make one last desperate JUMP as the earth literally DISAPPEARS beneath them.
EXT. rAZORBACK POINT - harbor (mOMENTS LATER)
CLOSE ON LEX -- lying in the snow, looking up at the sky.  
LEX rolls over to see -- She and Scar are lying on the very edge of a GIANT CRATER.  At the edge of the crater, huge chunks of ice stick into the air like shattered teeth.  Apart from a handful of burning buildings, the entire whaling station is gone.  All that remains are smashed timbers, the iced-over harbor and the Separator -- the giant vat for boiling whale blubber that she and Sebastian once discussed.  
Lex struggles to her knees.  It's hard to see the full expanse of the crater through the mist, but it's vast.  Far below lie the wrecked timbers of the whaling station.  Scar stands beside Lex.  He too has survived.
The SNOW around them HISSES and melts where chunks of Alien carcass have landed.  One of these chunks looks familiar.   It's a piece of Grid's head -- his signature pattern clearly visible.  Scar leans down and picks something up.  He carries it over to Lex.  She still wears the Alien Tail Spear and Shield slung over her back.  
Lex is still dazed, and it takes a moment for her to realize what is happening.  Scar pulls a trophy Alien finger from his belt.  He holds it, still dripping acid blood, right in front of her face.  Lex tenses in pain, but makes no sound, as the Predator begins to "blood" her.  Burning the distinctive Predator warrior scar into Lex's forehead with the acid blood of a dead Alien. She has earned the mark of a warrior.
THE CAMERA begins to PULL BACK and the music SWELLS.  We are left with the classic image of two tiny figures in a vast landscape.  The last survivors.  Surely this is the end of the movie.
SUDDENLY BEHIND THEM, THE ALIEN QUEEN BURSTS FROM THE SNOW!
None of her brood have survived, but the mother lives, and she's out for blood. Lex and Scar are showered with chunks of ice and snow.  
Scar reacts with lightning speed, cocking his WRIST GUARD and firing two sharp blades into the Queen's neck.  A second later he flings the last of his THROWING DISCS at the Queen.  The disc cuts through her throat, opening a gaping wound.  He catches the disc and throws again.  Chopping a chunk of the Queen's crown off.  
CLOSE ON SCAR --
As he reaches out to catch the disc, but at the last second --
THE ALIEN QUEEN'S TAIL whips around, smashing into Scar, flinging him into the remnants of a wooden building.  Scar survives the impact and falls to the ground.  He tries to rise, but a further blow from the Queen's tail drives him back to the ground.
THE ALIEN QUEEN closes in on Scar to finish him off.  Her tail hovers above Scar's prone body, ready for the killer blow.  
ANGLE ON LEX --
As she charges the Queen.  Driving the tip of her Alien spear into the Queen's neck.  Into the very wound that Scar had opened with his throwing disc.   The Queen SCREAMS in pain as Lex twists the blade, opening the wound still further.  The Queen attempts to crush Lex, but she shelters beneath the Queen's own body.  Lex is showered with acid blood, but it rolls off her shield fashioned from an Alien head.
The Queen WHIPS suddenly to one side.  Lex keeps a hold of her spear for a moment, and is lifted off the ground.  But her grip can't hold and Lex is flung away.  She lands hard, losing her shield.
The Queen struggles furiously with the spear still embedded in her neck.  Finally she pulls it loose, but in her frenzy, she loses balance, CRASHING into a still burning building.
The Queen rises from the flames.  Furious and ready for vengeance.  But Lex is gone!
EXT. whalebone graveyard
Lex shelters behind the giant skeleton of a whale.  Around her a striking landscape of bleached whalebones loom from the thick mist.  She can HEAR but not SEE the Alien Queen.  Somewhere out there she is moving through the mist, on the hunt for Lex.  The sound of her giant footsteps echo all around.  It's creepy as hell.
Lex's eyes strain in the gloom, but the Queen cannot be seen.  Her footsteps however are getting closer.
Without warning, the Queen lunges from the mist.  Looming right above Lex!!!
Lex runs, but the Queen is right behind her!  Lex sprints the length of a whale's skeleton, the bones curving around her like a giant cage.  The Queen is seconds behind her, crashing through the giant bones, sending them flying like toothpicks.  
The Queen is right on top of Lex, her jaws snapping, when Lex takes a sudden turn to the left.  The Queen is just too big and going too fast to be as agile as Lex.  The Queen attempts to turn, her teeth missing Lex by inches, but in an instant she overbalances and crashes across the ice in a spectacular explosion of snow and whalebones.
Within an instant however, she is back on her feet and hungry for blood. 
EXT. razorback point - harbor
The Queen's giant legs eat up the distance between Lex and herself in a matter of seconds.  Lex dives underneath the only shelter she can find - THE SEPARATOR.  It sits on the edge of the steep cliffs overlooking the harbor.  A giant metal vat, commented upon earlier by Sebastian, the Separator is held aloft by a complex web of metal and wood supports.  
The Queen impacts with the structure, almost ripping it from the ground and causing the Separator to drop three feet instantly, nearly crushing Lex.  
The Separator teeters on the edge of the harbor, threatening to topple any second into the pack ice far below.  THE ALIEN QUEEN starts smashing through the remaining supports using her claws and tail. 
LEX is narrowly avoiding the tail smashing in and out of the separator.  The Alien Queen smashes another support beam, weakening the Separator still more.  Now hopelessly overbalanced, the Separator begins to tip over, sliding further and further over the cliffs.  And the further it slides, the more it exposes Lex to the Queen.  
Lex is left defenceless and without shelter.  The Queen rears up, ready to strike.  Lex is dead for sure.
ANGLE ON SCAR --
Flying through the air in a giant Predator leap!  He drives his SPEAR clean through the side of the Queen's head and lands in the snow beside Lex in full Samurai pose.  Ready for battle.  The Queen HOWLS in pain, and for a moment, she is too distracted to fight any further.
ANGLE ON LEX --
As she sees that many of the restraints that had held the Alien Queen prisoner are still attached to her body.  Lex drags one of the LONG CHAINS still attached to the Alien Queen and attempts to hook it onto the Separator - still teetering on the edge of the cliffs.  
Her plan is clear.  The Separator will fall at any moment, dragging the Queen with it into the harbor.  The only problem is that these giant chain links are just too heavy for Lex to lift.
ANGLE ON SCAR --
As he appears beside Lex, helping her lift the chain and hook it onto the Separator.  For a glorious moment he and Lex work side-by-side.  
But suddenly Scar CONVULSES as the tail of the Alien Queen PUNCHES clean through his chest!!!  He is hoisted off the ground, the vengeful Queen looming above him.
The final remaining leg of the Separator finally gives way and THE SEPARATOR tumbles down the hill. The chain PULLS TIGHT and DRAGS the Alien Queen with it.  
Scar is flung free from the Queen's tail.
The Separator hits the pack ice covering the harbor.  It cracks the ice, but doesn't break through completely.  
THE ALIEN QUEEN is dragged to the edge of the cliffs but not into the freezing depths below.
ON THE SEPARATOR --
as a spiderweb of cracks spread out through the pack ice.  The ice is weakening, breaking up, but not fast enough.
THE ALIEN QUEEN makes one last lunge for Lex, like a dog on a chain.  Her jaws come within an inch of Lex, who is backed up against the torn remnants of a building, with nowhere to run.   The Queen strains at the end of her chain, her inner mouth shooting out, snapping right in front of Lex's face, threatening to tear it clean off.
ANGLE ON The Separator --
As it rocks back and forth, pulled by the Queen straining at the other end of her chain.  The pack ice finally cracks, and gives way under the strain.  The giant metal vat slips through the ice and is sucked into the water below.  
ANGLE ON THE QUEEN --
As the chain PULLS TIGHT.  Dragging the Alien Queen away from Lex.  The Alien SCREAMS in protest, but there is nothing she can do as she is dragged into the harbor by three tons of solid iron.
ON THE PACK ICE as the Alien Queen is dragged across the ice and through the gaping hole made by the Separator.
THERE ARE NO SCENE NUMBERS 131,132, 133, 134 & 135

Underwater: beneath the pack ice - cONTINUOUS
Beneath the ice, everything is silent.  Ghostly.  The Separator hurtles past the CAMERA, like a giant anchor headed straight to the bottom.  It is followed by the length of chain and then the Alien Queen.
THE ALIEN QUEEN is dragged down into the dark.  Into the abyss.  Eventually disappearing completely from view.
EXT. rAZORBACK POINT - HARBOR
Scar lies in the snow.  A fallen warrior.  Bloodied and broken, but dying with honor.  Lex cradles his head in her hands.  
Scar reaches for his ceremonial dagger, but is just too weak.  Lex helps it into his hands, and for a moment Scar holds the blade before his own chest.  Almost as if he intended to stab himself.  It's a striking image, but one that will make little sense UNtil the end of the picture.
scaR
(in Lex's voice)
The enemy of my enemy...
LEX
Is my friend.
And then Scar dies.  The blade falling unused by his side.
For a moment, the storm seems to reduce in fury.  The sky clears to reveal the PREDATOR SPACECRAFT hovering directly above the remnants of the whaling station.  On a low rise overlooking the battleground stand THREE DOZEN PREDATOR ELDERS.  They had seen everything. 
Four more PREDATORS pick up Scar's body and carry him toward a long ramp leading up to the belly of the spacecraft.
Lex stares at the army of Predators.  There is a tense standoff.                                        
(NB: SCENE 137 CONTINUES ON PAGE 92) A Predator Elder stares at the Human Woman.  He sees the distinctive Predator warrior scar on her forehead.  The same scar that he and all the others wear.  Then he nods in respect.  As the rest of the Predators file back onto the Spacecraft, the Predator Elder hands Lex his SPEAR.  The gesture has the feeling of ancient ceremony about it.  The message is clear. Lex has become a hunter.
Lex takes the spear.  And the Predator Elder turns back to the Spaceship.  As he turns, the MAIN THRUSTERS of the Predator Craft are starting to fire up.  Causing a snowstorm beneath the ship.
Lex is covered in blood and bruises, holding the warrior's spear and marked with the Predator warrior scar, Lex has never looked more formidable.  She seems more Predator than Human.  She watches the Spacecraft as it rises into the heavens, becoming lost in the storm.  Lex takes something from her pocket.  It's Sebastian's bottle cap.  She turns it over in her hand, the emotion of the moment clear.  
Lex looks up to the heavens.  A break in the storm reveals a giant full moon hanging in the sky.  The moon she had been looking at just the other night with Sebastian.  She closes her hand around the bottle cap and looks up to the skies.
LEX (CONT'D)
(softly)
... 'Hunter's Moon.'
EXT. oUTER SPACE 
The Predator Spacecraft glides past our Moon, headed away from Earth, into deep space.
INT. pREDATOR SPACECRAFT 
Scar's dead body has been laid to rest in a place of honor.   Scar's faceplate is off, displaying the Predator warrior  scar.  He died a warrior's death.  
The air is heavy with incense and some kind of religious ceremony has just finished.  The last of the PREDATOR ELDERS is filing out of the room, returning to the cryo-stasis tubes, ready for the journey back into deep space.  Scar's body is left alone in the silent chamber.
Scar's chest begins to CONVULSE!  Tearing its way out of Scar's dead body is an ALIEN CHEST BURSTER!  
The Alien that develops inside a Predator is bigger and more frightening than anything we've ever seen. A HYBRID between ALIEN and PREDATOR. An unstoppable killing machine. And its loose on the Predator ship, heading for God knows where.
CLOSE ON THE ALIEN-PREDATOR HYBRID as it bursts free.  Covered in Predator blood.  RAZOR SHARP teeth catching the light.
