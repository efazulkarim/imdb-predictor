What the fuck is this? 
What the fuck are you doing here? What the fuck are you doing here? Fucking stuck. 
Yeah, me too. 
What the fuck? 
Oh my god. 
Somebody help us! 
Somebody help us! 
Aw, Dina! 
Brad, Ryan? 
Baby, are you okay? 
Get me outta here! 
Babe... 
Help us! 
Somebody help us! 
Hey, call the police. 
Hey, break the glass with your case! Get me out of here! 
Break the fucking glass. 
Do it. 
Get back, stay back! 
Do it! 
Get me out of here! 
Break it! 
Hello, Brad. 
Hello, Ryan. 
I want to play a game. 
The same woman 
has played each of you for a fool. Manipulated her love for her 
and causing nothing but pain. 
Her fun and games pushed you 
both to break the law 
to fulfill her material needs. She is toxic. 
And today, all of your transgressions will be made public. 
He's fucking lying, Brad! 
Now you must choose 
who will drop out of this triangle, for within 60 seconds one of you must die. 
If you wish to save her, 
Page 2/32
then the saws must be pushed 
all the way to one side or the other. Sparing her and proving who is 
indeed the alpha male. 
What are you fucking staring 
at you motherfuckers? 
Do something! 
Are you both strong enough 
to walk away from what is destroying you? Or will you fight one more time for the heart that binds? 
You have 60 seconds to decide. 
Live or die. 
Make your choice. 
Oh, fuck. 
One of you, save me! 
Fuck! 
What the fuck are you doing? 
It's me or you, asshole, 
and it sure as shit isn't gonna be me! Brad! Brad, Brad, I love you! 
I love you too, babe. 
Do it, you gotta do it. 
You gotta kill him, Brad! 
Do it! 
Stupid bitch! 
Do it. 
Do it. Do it! 
Ah, fuck. 
You love him? 
No. 
You love him more than me? 
No, I had to say that. 
I've always loved you. 
You gotta do it for me, 
please. 
You gotta kill him. 
Kill Brad, do it! 
You're lying. 
What the fuck are you doing? 
You don't love anyone. 
You're a cheat and a liar. 
Fuck you! Fuck you! 
Brad! Brad, look at me! 
Page 3/32
Is the chick that fucked me in 
your bed two days ago worth 
one of our lives? 
She's not worth it, man, 
she's not worth it. 
Right? 
Yeah! 
What are you doing, you fucking asshole? I think we're breaking up with you, Dina! No! No! 
Somebody help her! 
Game over. 
No! No, you fucking bitch! No! 
Tonight a house of horrors 
has been discovered 
at what used to be known as 
the Rowan Zoological Institute. 
The body of Umbrella Health CEO 
William Easton, 
had been identified as one of 
several victims of this grisly crime scene. However, we've also been informed that there may be as many as 7 survivors in this deadly event. 
(The questions of local police, 
FBI and families of victims, 
) 
be answered 
by those 7 people 
who were lucky enough to walk 
away from this unprecedented () 
Now let Tony Gabrielson 
at the scene. Tony? 
) I NEED BETTER HEADPHONEs FOR THIS SHIT Hey man. 
Hey, what's up. 
What have we got here? 
That's Jill Tuck. Jigsaw's widow. What does she want? 
All she said was that she didn't trust the FBI... 
Uh-huh. 
And she didn't trust homicide. 
Oh, good... 
Page 4/32
And she just wants to talk to you. 
Why me? 
I don't know. Only you though. 
Jeez... she looks crazier than a sack full of cats. Alright, let's get this over with. 
Hey. I put uh, cream and sugar. 
Thank you. 
You're welcome. 
I'm Matt Gibson, internal affairs. 
A colleague said that 
you wanted to speak to me. 
Yes. 
But I need complete immunity. 
Why do you want immunity, 
Ms. Tuck? 
Because of what I know. 
Which is what? 
Do we have a deal? 
You've got to give before you 
can receive in this house, Jill. 
My husband, John, 
had an accomplice. 
Mm. 
The person who assisted 
him with almost every murder. 
Look, don't get me wrong, 
I'm- I'm all ears 
if you've got something legit 
that you want to put on the table. 
This person will go on killing 
until he's stopped. 
You know him 
and he definitely knows you. 
Is that right? 
He's Detective Mark Hoffman. 
Are you willing to sign a sworn affidavit? Yes. 
You swear to be totally open 
and tell me everything, no matter 
how personal or private? 
Yes. I'll give you evidence, whatever you want, as long as I have your protection. 
And complete immunity. 
Do we have a deal? 
Page 5/32
Oh, yeah... yeah, we have a deal. 
Welcome back. 
We're live with 
Bobby Dagen, 
Who's national tour 
"SURVIVE, 
my story of overcoming Jigsaw" 
rolls into town this 
weekend. 
Well, you're quite the national phenomenon these days, aren't you? 
Well, thank you, ma'am. 
It's quite flattering how many people responded to my story 
and if I can help a few people 
along the way then- then I'm... I'm pleased. Now, you survived a trap 
created by the infamous Jigsaw Killer, correct? Yes, ma'am. 
Well everyone must ask you this question, what was that like? 
Life changing. 
It was something I never anticipated. Quite honestly, 
something that should have killed me. Tell me more. Tell me about 
the actual experience. 
I-I actually have no recollection of how I got there. 
I just remember the feeling 
of waking up trapped... 
And I had to insert two hooks 
into the pectoral muscles 
and hoist myself up to a platform. 
You put the hooks in yourself? 
I did. 
I pretty much realized that I couldn't hold on much longer. 
And I had to accept the fact 
that I was going to die. 
And then I saw something, 
and what I saw was my life. 
It was a tragedy. 
I achieved nothing. 
Page 6/32
Right then, something inside 
me started to grow. 
Something from- from the bottom 
of my soul. 
And I just- I decided to live. 
I found a strength that I thought 
have lost since expired. 
And I just yanked, and I yanked, 
and when I got to the top 
I just ripped the hooks out of my chest There was- there was blood everywhere and I just screamed. 
I just sat there and screamed. 
Because I hadn't just survived... 
I was reborn. 
This was my life! 
Wow! Uh, Bobby Dagen, everyone. 
Bobby's life changing experience 
comes to () auditorium this weekend... This is the moment. 
Where's the big kiss? 
I don't know. 
And we're out, folks. 
That's not the way it's supposed to be, no... Nice work, buddy. 
Hey ladies, would you excuse us for a moment? Where was the big finish, Bobby, hm? 
You tell your story, 
you thank your pretty wife, 
you bring her up for a big hug and kiss I just didn't want to push it, alright? Ok, but that's the heart of the story. She was there for you your whole recovery. And without the acknowledgement, 
without the- the kiss, 
the audience isn't gonna have any 
emotional connections. 
I disagree. 
Too much emotion, it's gonna feel like pandering. Ok, why don't you let me do the public relations and you do the legal paperwork, ok? 
Ok, I get it, suzane, alright? It's my fault. It wasn't your fault, Bobby. 
You were fine. 
Page 7/32
And just remember your bullet points 
next time. 
I will, alright? 
The interviews are important. 
Nina, relax. 
Don't worry about them. 
You were great. 
Yeah? 
Your story is real and people feel that. I know that you get overwhelmed 
at times, but we have to keep 
moving forward, Bobby. 
You were meant to do this. 
I know... I know, baby. 
Bobby? 
Yeah? 
We got the Jigsaw survivor group tomorrow, thirty minutes of face time with other survivors. Yeah, sounds good. 
What more can you say than that? 
No, not much. 
Oh god! 
You wanna know the only thing wrong 
with killing you, Jill? 
I can only do it once. 
Oh my god! 
Hey! 
Help me! 
Help! 
Hello, Evan. 
I want to play a game. 
The situation you find yourself in is 
of your own doing. 
You, your girlfriend, and your friends, are all racists. 
Evan, fuck, get me out of here! 
You have intimidated others based 
on their physical differences. 
But today, it is you 
who will run scared. 
Your pathetic friends follow your every word, Evan. Therefore, you will be 
the only one capable of saving them and yourself. In thirty seconds, the jacks 
Page 8/32
holding up this car will fall, 
setting off a deadly chain of events. In order to stop this from happening, you must tear yourself away from the seat, in which you are glued. 
Then you must pull the red lever before you. 
But no act comes without a sacrifice. You've judged others by 
the color of their skin, 
and today, Evan, 
you will learn 
that we are all the same color 
on the inside. 
Live or die, Evan. 
The choice is yours. 
Help me! 
Go to hell! 
Go! 
Go, damn it! 
Evan, let me out. 
Here I come! 
Us out of here! 
God! Please! 
Evan, please! 
Go, damn it! 
You brought us here, 
us out of here! 
The fucking fag! 
Every night I think 
that things will improve. 
When I wake up 
the next day. 
But never are. 
Everything I do, 
all I see, 
I'm surrounded 
for these traps. 
They are everywhere, 
and remind me of what I did. 
What is Jigsaw did to me. 
Sydney continues 
please. 
You are in a safe place 
Page 9/32
now. 
Tell me what happens next. 
Please! 
Alex! 
Sydney, look at me. 
You made a decision. 
How do you feel about it? 
I feel free. 
He was abusive. 
I tried to stop him before, 
but just at that moment 
I did something. 
It was him or me, 
chose to live. 
It was the best thing 
what happened to me. 
It's a bunch of bullshit. 
He had to die 
for you to leave him? 
Know the best thing 
what happened to me 
after cutting off 
my own arm? 
Handicap parking 
at the damn mall. 
Why would a camera here? 
I just came here to show 
that a traumatic experience, 
as we 
faced, 
can have a positive side. 
That is all. 
Is it? Like what? 
A new perspective on life. 
You have not yet reached 
this point, I understand. 
I understand and respect that. But if you look around 
for these people, 
who do not value 
their lives, 
one hour everyone will find 
something positive in this experience. We should never be ashamed 
Page 10/32
than we. 
Because we are good. 
And we are strong! 
You know what 
I'd like everybody to have a look at... something. Right here. 
These are my scars. 
Because our minds 
will heal. 
But these scars 
will never go away. 
These scars should not be 
a symbol of shame. 
They should be worn as a 
badge of courage. 
You know, earlier, I spoke of 
valuing 
your loved ones. 
But to be perfectly honest, 
It's just- just something that I never did prior to my ordeal. 
But since then, 
I have found someone who... 
has truly become my rock. 
Joyce, if you could... please. 
My uh, lovely wife, 
Joyce. 
I love you. 
Love you too, 
baby. 
Bravo. Hm? 
To be able to sustain such a traumatic experience and uh... 
and yet find the positive 
in that grisly act... 
It is a remarkable feat indeed. 
Remarkable... 
if not a little perverse? 
I'm sure I speak 
for everyone here 
when I say 
how grateful we are, 
to be part of your... 
promotional DVD. 
Page 11/32
...Appreciate it, thank you. 
"I take it, sir. 
Thank you. 
Joyce, I borrow it? 
Sure. I head to the car. 
-Coming. 
Accompanies it? 
Sure. 
Thank you. 
What? 
The strange guy's stick, 
should meet him? 
No, he has more time 
I meetings. 
He is good people. 
Okay. 
Return to hotel and rest 
a little. 
-It will be okay. 
-Well done today, Bobby. 
-Thanks. 
"You're the man. 
Joyce? 
What happened to him? 
Always speak to no smoking 
in the gas station. 
This concludes the report 
the week. 
Hey big guy? 
I'm in the junkyard, 
at 58. 
Why? 
They called about an accident 
Car. 
If an accident, 
why are you there? 
It was not just an accident. 
A trap. 
How many bodies? 
Picking up the pieces, 
are 4. 
Right. Keep everyone away from there until I arrive. 
Even the murderers. 
Page 12/32
"Right. 
-Okay, I'm coming. 
Hello, Evan. 
I want to start a game. 
The situation in which it is 
you have created yourself. 
You, your girlfriend, your friends, are all racists. 
Deterred many people 
because of their 
physical differences. 
Today it is you 
that will be... 
What do you think? 
Why? 
What for this show? 
Why would they? 
Why now? 
You know he loves 
attention. 
Yeah, I know. Must have 
something else. 
Collecting the bodies and take to the coroner immediately. 
Anything 
may be a clue. 
Tattoos, piercings, 
cuts in the skin... 
This man has a cavity, 
want to know about it. 
"Yes, sir. 
-Okay. 
Gibson. 
Hi 
The Ralfman was waiting. 
Dammit. 
GIBSON, 
SEE YOURSELF: 
See that? 
Ask expertise to come here. 
Send them move. 
Check for digital 
it there. 
Page 13/32
"Right. 
Great. 
GIBSON, 
SEE YOURSELF: 
Help! 
SURVIVE: 
Hello, Bobby. 
I want to play a game. 
You have amassed wealth, 
fame, and notoriety 
based upon your story of survival. Many have aided in your cause. But few know the truth. 
You are a liar. 
You and I both know you 
have never been in a trap. 
Nor have you ever been tested. Today, these lies 
will come full circle, 
And you will learn if you truly have what it takes to call yourself a survivor. 
The cage you find yourself in will symbolizes your rebirth. 
Joyce! 
No! 
Joyce! 
No... 
Please don't... 
Over the next 60 minutes, 
you must stay on the path 
of learning and traverse 
a series of obstacles 
to obtain access to your wife, who you have also deceived. 
If you fail to reach her before the clock runs out, 
she will die. 
No... 
Live or die, Bobby. 
Make your choice. 
Bobby! 
Page 14/32
Help! 
Let me out! 
Bobby! 
What's happening? 
What's happening? 
Another survivor of Jigsaw 
just appeared. 
While the city 
still scared 
with the murders of Jigsaw 
information chilling 
the last survivor 
recall the consequences 
physical and mental 
that cause these deadly games. This horrible event 
what happened to me 
at that moment, 
that time 
I had one thing 
that I could take it all... 
including pain. 
Then I realized that even 
had much to live. 
Do not want to pay that. 
That opened my eyes, 
that moment full of terror 
opened my eyes 
and strangely enough, 
come a better person. 
I am strong and I must admit 
I am grateful... 
Grateful to have 
happened to me. 
And I mean for all 
I like... 
Joan is one among 
this moment... 
If something does not change 
your perspective on life, 
then nothing changes. 
Today there are groups for aid for victims as Joan... 
These people earn some money 
Page 15/32
selling their stories. 
It has a design 
very interesting 
It's you or your husband? 
"Everything he did it. 
Right. 
Here is my problem. 
That was left for me 
and their fingerprints are on it. When I said that Hoffman 
was behind you, 
mentioned that it was not 
because you tried to kill him. There's a new game going. 
Does that surprise you? 
-No. 
"No? No? 
You're mad, you know? 
I knew it was crazy 
when I saw you. 
Mad... 
Okay. 
That's what we do, crazy. 
Until I get Mark Hoffman, 
this is your new home. 
Make yourself at home. 
Why do you think he does not 
find me here? 
Jill, this is a hiding place. 
Hideout. 
Got it? 
Gibson, it was sent 
Jill. 
Hoffman knows-where we are. 
-What the fuck! 
What? 
A car exploded 
at the scene. 
There are wounded? 
-Roger, are you okay? 
-I. 
Get out there. 
Send the bomb squad 
map the area 
Page 16/32
and not touch anything. 
Understood. 
Beauty. 
Turn the video. 
Hello, Gibson. 
It's been a while. 
What I want is simple. 
Give me Jill Tuck. 
You are protecting despite 
the fact of her knowing everything. What makes it 
complicit in every death. 
I offer you a deal: 
Give it to me. 
The game ends 
and no one else dies. 
Otherwise, all die 
and will be your fault. 
Make your decision. 
The clock is counting. 
Best arresting Jill 
in a police cell. 
Hold it and nobody can see it 
without permission. 
Beauty. 
RESE YOUR PRIORITIES 
My God. 
My God! 
No, please! 
No, please! 
Please, no! 
What the fuck! 
Bobby, help me! 
Gotta get me out of here! 
I can not move, 
Bobby! 
Please, help me! 
"All right. Relax. 
Help me. Do something. 
GIVE PLAY: 
Hello, Bobby. 
Before you are a

Page 17/32
She has been his adviser 
press for years, 
aware of their lies 
and choosing to defend them. 
She was rewarded 
by his words, 
but today will be rewarded 
by their silence. 
In radiography, see the key 
Nina's survival, 
that will shut down 
your device. 
But there is a challenge. 
Got a minute to pull 
the hook of her stomach 
and open the device, 
or 4 cuttings 
will come in her throat, 
silencing her forever. 
Remember, the stakes 
also advance 
Each time the level 
decibels of the room 
is above a whisper, 
killing it even earlier. 
Nina will live or die, 
Bobby? 
The choice is yours. 
Just stay quiet. 
Stay with me, okay? 
I'll pull. 
It's okay. Stay with me. 
It'll be fine. 
Quiet, please. 
For me. 
Shut your mouth. 
Let me pull it. 
No, no! 
Pull right, Bobby. 
Pull it. 
Pull it. 
No! 
Why just 
not shut up? 
Page 18/32
Just had to have 
shut your mouth! 
No! 
My God! 
No! 
No! 
Help! 
SURVIVE. 
BOBBY Dagen. 
Here you are. Take care. 
-Mrs. What's your name? 
-Sara. 
Without the "H". 
I mean 
I love your book too. 
Looks like I could feel 
everything you went through. 
I'm sorry that it has changed my life. "I thank you, ma'am. 
I appreciate it. 
Thanks. 
Thank you. 
Your name, sir? 
John. 
You have quite an army 
working for you here, don't you? Must be spreading a pretty good word. Well, we try to reach as many 
people as possible. 
You don't see anything wrong with that? Uh, no, sir. I don't. 
You know, 
history is a passion 
for me. 
And in ancient Egypt, 
if you were speaking under oath you're required to say: 
"If I'm lying... 
take me to the quarries. " 
That means anything 
for you? 
No, sir, it doesn't. 
Well, I'll tell you what it means. If you lied on the public record, 
Page 19/32
you're subject to a period of enslavement. What are you implying here, sir? I'm not implying anything. 
Move along, buddy, 
he signed your book. 
Thanks for the signature. 
Nice picture, 
but I don't need it. 
We've met. 
Adam, look at this immediately, 
are from the junkyard. 
Take your pick. 
The clock is ticking. 
"See that? 
-Yes. 
I know what 
somewhere. 
I found something here. 
Perhaps knowing 
who's in the game. 
This is a camera 
Security at the center. 
The guy's name is Bobby Dagen. 
You know him? 
-No. 
It's a survivor of Jigsaw, 
is giving interviews 
on talk shows. 
His wife and his aides 
also disappeared. 
COMMIT YOURSELF MORE 
WITH THINGS: 
Joyce? 
Who's there? 
Suzanne. 
Let me out! Bobby! 
Bobby, get me out of here! 
Help me! 
The Cale-here? 
-How do I know? 
Take it from me. 
Take it, please! 
Hello, Bobby. What is 
Page 20/32
feeling now is fear. 
Fear of not having what is 
necessary to survive. 
Before you 
His lawyer, 
who took an oath 
before the ethics, 
but chose to ignore the bad 
in order to benefit. 
When the device where 
she is starting to turn, 
stick eyes and her mouth 
if not to delay the movements 
for at least 30 seconds. 
To do this, 
should go to another machine 
and raise the bar 
to the highest position 
long enough 
to close the circuit 
and delay device. 
If you do nothing, she will die before the clock stops. 
Think you can help her? 
Make your choice. 
Bobby, help me! 
Get me outta here. 
My God! 
Bobby, please! 
Please help me! 
Help me! Help me! 
Come on, Bobby! 
C'mon! 
Hurry! Hurry! 
Hurry! 
Please! 
Help me! Help me! 
No! No! 
No! No! My God! 
No! Bobby! 
Get me outta here! 
My God! No! 
Bobby, please! 
No! No! 
Page 21/32
My God! 
No! 
Help! 
Know this guy? 
I've seen him on television, 
but do not know. 
"And your husband? 
I do not know. 
Sure 
do not know about? 
Yeah, sure. 
Okay. 
You can lock. 
Hoffman just sent 
an email with a video attached. "I'm trying to find the IP. 
-Can you figure out where it came from? Depends on how many proxies 
he used to filter. 
But there's a delay, 
then leave a trail. 
You can rotate. 
Hello, Gibson. 
Once again we are 
in a moral crossroads. 
I do not blame me for not delivering Jill Tuck. 
But should not let a feud 
affect his trial. 
Look where you are. 
Look beyond the crossroads 
to see the light. 
Can you see? 
Understood. Come on. 
Joyce? 
IGNORE its detractors. 
-Cale? 
-Bobby? Bobby? 
Cale, I see you, right? 
Do not move. 
-Where are you? 
You know where is Joyce? 
Do not see anything, man! 
How do I know where she is? 
Page 22/32
I do not know where she is! 
I'm blind, man! 
All right, Cale, quiet! 
-For God's sake! 
Do not move! 
The floor is not full. 
You are missing a piece. 
Do not move! Right? 
Help me, Bobby! 
Help me! Help me! 
-You have a tape. 
"What the fucking tape? 
Shut up! 
I'll play the tape! 
Hello, Bobby. 
In front is 
his best friend. 
He knows 
all your secrets, 
and still acts 
to see if there's no harm. 
Today 
your ears will make a difference between life and death. 
Should help Cale 
to walk the boards, 
and get as close as possible 
you. 
Make your way 
until the key. 
He must deliver the 
the last space between you. 
If the noose around the neck of Cale is not removed in 60 seconds 
a winch is activated, 
and his secret would be hung. 
Cale will live or die, Bobby? 
The choice is yours. 
Bobby! 
Cale! 
Cale, please listen to me! 
Shut up and listen to me 
once in a lifetime! 
-Help me! 
Page 23/32
"I'm coming to you, buddy. 
What are you waiting for? 
Try to get 
nearest you. 
To cross, 
help me! 
I want you to walk 
right. 
-Take a step right. 
"Right, got it. 
You will feel 
a board foot. 
"I want to walk by that board. 
"Right. 
I did it! 
Damn! 
Calm down. 
I'm coming. 
Shit! Help me! 
-You have a board in front. 
"Right. 
Well on your right. 
-I found! 
Do not stop talking to me! 
"Okay, okay. 
"If the league table! 
So-so? 
"What was that? 
"Nothing, was a bottle. 
"What the fuck was that? 
It was one-bottle. 
"You'll be fine! 
-Yeah, right! 
Yeah, buddy. 
Success! 
Now you will feel another board, search with his foot. 
-Seek with your foot! 
-Yeah, right! 
Do not stop talking to me! 
Now that tablet-step! 
"My God! 
"Easy, is going well! 
Hold on! 
Page 24/32
Easy! Hold on! 
Bobby! Bobby! 
-I got the key! 
-Get me outta here! 
I'll play! 
Place your hands near the chest! "I'll throw it in March, right? "Right. 
A! 
Two! 
Three! 
Shit! 
No! 
Cale! 
No! Cale! 
No! Stop! 
You do not have anything here. -It does. 
Right there. 
Why would he want 
you here? 
So I can remember. 
It was here that he saved 
my life. 
When I was in the streets, 
responded to a call, that... 
This place was just a cache 
for addicts and beggars. 
Stopped, do not move! 
Drop your weapon! 
The guy never saw 
what hit him. 
Yes, I know, he attacked me, 
but had to turn 
a death sentence. 
The next time 
shoot first. 
I had no choice, 
but to denounce Hoffman. 
You owe me one. 
And what happened? 
He was promoted. 
That's what happened. 
And I was sent to an island. 
Page 25/32
A year later, 
I was transferred to the AI 
and he swore revenge. 
And here we are. 
This place was called 
Factory "Crossroads" 
before being closed. 
"Look beyond 
the crossroads... 
to see the light. " 
And then? 
The man he killed 
had emerged from a hospice 
called the "Light" 
which had been interdicted. 
That building is abandoned 
years. 
That's where the game 
is happening. 
Go back to the station. 
Stay with Jill Tuck. 
Do not take your eyes off her! VALUE WHO YOU LOVE 
Bobby! 
-Joyce? 
-Bobby! Bobby! 
Bobby, I'm here! 
-Joyce. 
"I'm here. 
Joyce, 
I can see you and hear you. 
"I can see you too. 
-Is it? 
-Get me outta here! 
"I'm going. 
Who is doing this? 
And why? 
"Why is this happening? 
"Easy, dear, I'm coming. 
-Hang in there, right? 
-Quick, please! 
Must have 
a record here... 
Hello, Bobby. 
Page 26/32
Facing you is the door 
that will take you to his wife, 
but will have to do 
a choice. 
As you probably noticed, 
Your choice will be so difficult as pulling teeth. 
The lock needs 
a combination of four digits 
to open. 
However, if you want to enter, 
need to make a sacrifice 
true. 
Watch and learn, Bobby. 
The numbers you need 
are two of his teeth. 
See the box to know 
which start 
to get the numbers. 
Time is running out. 
Need to make his choice soon. 
Bobby! 
I do not want to see this, 
right, dear? 
My God! 
No! 
No! 
Clean! 
-Clean! 
-Clean! 
The game is still 
happening. 
-Clean! 
-Clean! 
Come on! 
A-body! 
"I've seen. 
Clean! 
-Speech. 
-I found out where it came from the video. -Where? 
Iron-old Pete, 
Rua 58. 
That junkyard. 
Page 27/32
The post-trap car. 
"Yeah, right. 
"We must continue. 
"Where are we? 
Take the Hoffman. 
Right. 
Roggers. 
Yes 
What? 
What happened? 
Discovered 
Hoffman's location. 
End of game. 
We have a survivor. 
We can not cross here. 
Come on. 
Take rifles 
and come with me. 
GIBSON: 
Give me the gun. 
Hoffman! Do not move! 
Place your hands 
slowly upward. 
ENJOY EVERY DAY: 
AS IF IT WERE THE LAST. 
-Joyce? 
-Bobby! 
I knew I'd find. 
-Sorry. 
"I knew you would. 
Get me outta here. 
Bobby! 
My God. 
There must be another way. 
Hello, Bobby. 
Almost completed 
its revival. 
However, the ultimate test 
is always the hardest. 
The woman in front 
symbolizes his success. 
She is your trophy. 
Page 28/32
She sees the good side 
his statements, 
despite the dishonest means. 
What is he talking about? 
Today we'll see if it deserves 
love it. 
To prove you're a survivor, 
should win a game 
you should be familiar. 
Supposedly survived 
him once 
then it should be 
easy to survive again. 
Fasten the hooks 
on your chest 
and the game begin. 
To free yourself 
and his wife, 
should stay with these 
current and connect the extension. Before time runs out. 
Need both hands 
to accomplish this task. 
But the challenge will not be difficult. As you yourself pointed out, 
pectoral muscles can 
support its weight. 
So Bobby, you ask, 
when you live each day as 
it was my last, 
will be with your wife? 
Make your choice. 
-What is he talking about? 
-Sorry. 
I lied. 
Never been 
in a trap. 
As I left 
believe that? 
I'll fix it. 
You should not be there. 
I'm your wife! 
He lied to me! 
I know him from somewhere. 
Page 29/32
Make your choice 
the clock is ticking. 
Send the bodies 
to the coroner immediately. 
Lord, what is it? 
Hoffman tapped our 
security system. 
We watched 
each movement. 
My God. 
Palmer. 
Send units 
back to the station. 
What? 
-Immediately. 
Lord. 
Still there? 
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED 
Locked door. 
Gas! 
Gas! 
I love you, Joy. 
I never lied about it. 
I love you. 
Bobby, I love you. 
Gibson? 
You can, 
you can. 
Bobby, I love you. 
You can! 
Hang on! Hang on! 
Wow! Wow! 
Gee, Bobby! 
You can! 
My God! 
Wow! 
What was that? 
Wow! Wow! 
Wow! 
Wow! 
You're almost there! 
Come on, Bobby, you can! 
Anyone out there. 
My God! 
Page 30/32
No! Help! 
Help! 
I've been looking 
for you. 
How do I look? 
Hm? 
Bitch! 
Help! 
Bobby, please hurry! 
Quick, Bobby! 
You can! 
Quick! Quick! 
You can! 
Bobby, safe! 
Safe! 
Just one more! 
Quick, can you! 
You did it. 
Bobby! 
No! 
Bobby! 
No! 
-Bobby! No! 
-Joyce! 
-Joyce! 
-Bobby! 
Joyce! 
Bobby! 
Slut! 
Bitch! 
Bobby! 
Bobby! 
Joyce! 
No! No! 
Joyce! 
End of game. 
In the last two hours, 
seems that the whole city 
was shaken. Besides 
of nine police officers killed today Jill Tuck, the wife 
serial killer John Kramer 
was found dead. 
Citizens are asked to 
Page 31/32
who report 
any suspicious activity 
while blocks 
are placed 
mostly highway 
at a radius 
What the fuck... 
Hello, Doctor Gordon. 
You are perhaps 
my greatest asset... 
Congratulations, Dr. Gordon, 
you survived. 
Without you, my work 
over the last few years 
would not have been possible. 
Jeff's wife. 
Dr. Lynn Denlon. 
She'll be perfect. 
My eyes! I can't see! 
Having been said I have a request. Watch over Jill. 
And should anything happen to her, I want you to act immediately 
on my behalf. 
In return for that, 
I will keep no more secrets from you. I have shown you a lot of places. But there is one that will be perhaps the most meaningful to you. 
I don't think so. 
What do you think you're doing? What the fuck do you think you're doing!? Huh!? 
No! 
You can't fucking do this to me! Fuck you! No! 
Game over. 
No!!!
