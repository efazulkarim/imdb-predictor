How are you?
Well, but we
two other giving birth.
There we can see the eclipse.
He'd better go.
Mrs. Brody, I have told
to wait for another week.
Tell the child.
- How is Mrs. Seton?
- I have a few minutes.
It is the first time that
women line up for me.
They could not
be more appropriate.
- Three births, eh.
- Bid!
- It's a boy, Mrs. Taylor.
- A child, how beautiful!
Do what I say,
not incorporated.
Push.
- It's a girl, Mrs. Brody.
- I thought not even a name!
He has had a child, Mrs. Seton.
MEADOWVALE, CALIFORNIA
JUNE 1, 1980
You want to play to the ambulance?
What is that??
Okay ...
This is ... the ambulance.
I do not want to stop at the red light.
Red light!
I remember seeing an ambulance
stopping at the red light.
- What if someone sees us?
- We did not see anyone.
Would not be right, because
They will bury someone here.
Worried about sins?

Page 2/20

We will.
Willard, if you,
I'll kick your ass!
Hi there.
What do you do??
She fed the dog.
Why do not you walk in the
door like a normal person?
It was locked inside.
Okay, Birdman, to bed.
You're lucky dad
and Mom are not home.
Do you understand why it is important
cooperate with the police?
Curtis??
The job of the police is
protect and help people.
You're late, Joyce.
The police need the
collaboration of all.
If you want recognition for helping
here, you have to be on time.
That's it.
Flatterer.
Does anyone know what it means
the word 'murder'?
Debbie??
It is when a person kills
someone, like on TV.
No, dear.
Not like on TV.
On TV, everything is a lie.
Do people think that we are
a bunch of babies?
Anybody lost or found a
jump rope with a handle that?
Surely they know that Annie Smith
Duke and Benson were killed.
Have any of you been
last night in the cemetery?
If you remember seeing something strange,
Ms. Davis tell him or me.
That ring does not mean they can go.
It's just a sign that

Page 3/20

I tell them they can go.
Thank you, Commissioner Brody.
To you, Miss Davis.
- Bye, Dad.
- Goodbye, my dear.
When they are all seated
and silent, I'll let go.
Even they are not rights.
Very well ...
I do not want that ... go running
like thugs.
They can ...
... Leave.
- Where were you last night?
- Giving feed the dog.
So you're lying?
- No.
- You sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
If they call Mom and Dad, do not
tell him and Annie Duke.
Why not??
Daddy do not want you to worry.
It's bad for your heart.
Ms. Davis can take away
Monday's homework?
No, dear.
But it's our birthday
and everyone will be at the party.
The duties are
important than the holidays.
And having a birthday on the same day,
not mean that they are special.
Well, having a
good day, Miss Davis.
Thank you, dear.
Hurry up or we lose!
Come on, we pay.
What if we find?
Impossible, the brain
have it in your bra.
Worth 25 cents. If you want
keep looking, is overtime.
Well, well.

Page 4/20

Hey, Joyce, wait!
- Hi there.
- Hi there.
It was horrible and Annie Duke.
- Yes, it was very strange.
- It is terrible, terrible.
Willard and I are going
much to the cemetery.
Why?
To bury us
no, that's for sure.
Have you done your horoscope?
Yes.
So what?
Willard must be crazy
so sexy like you Scorpio.
Genial!
What do you call Paul lately?
No, he is very busy
with their exams.
Are you sure that's it
what have you taken?
Paul and I are confident
into each other.
Because I do not think he likes knowing that
spend so much time with Mr. Harding.
Beverly, Mr. Harding is married.
Yes, but he is very handsome
and likes you a lot.
Your brain looks like something out
an erotic telenovela.
Yes, but you seem handsome.
Come on, admit it, I know.
- Hello, Dad.
- Hi there.
Hi, Joyce.
Beverly where are you going?
A buy candles for the cake
and a movie with Willard.
- No, you're not.
- Why?
Do not ask. I want you in
home before dark.
A crime in 20 years

Page 5/20

and is believed to Kojak.
- Hi there.
- Hi there.
What we spend on security is not
work if you leave the door open ...
And ... there's a madman
I am sorry.
I was in and out for
prepare the birthday party.
Everyone here knows you.
Dad, come here.
I want to show you something.
What is it, honey?
What happen??
Where did you get this?
Debbie what happens?
Hey, what happened?
Mom, Dad has fallen!
Dad has fallen!
Out of the way.
Jimmy, Jim ...
Jimmy.
Jimmy!
The Brody Commissioner, was a man
good, honest and hardworking.
Let me remind you the words
Jesus Christ our Lord.
'Let not your hearts be troubled ...
At home ... because my
parent, there are many mansions.
I will prepare a place for
you, in the Lord's house.
Where I am going,
may not follow ...
But ... who believes in
me have eternal life.
Pray.
Our Father, who
you're in heaven ...
... Hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom.
Thy will be done
on earth as in heaven.
Forgive us our trespasses ...

Page 6/20

As we forgive ...
those who trespass against us.
Lead us not into temptation ...
... For thine is the kingdom, the power
and the glory, forever. Amen.
One two three,
four, five, six ...
Let's find a place
to hide.
And you did not copy the
hiding or I'll shoot.
Do not worry, it's toy.
Let's get us.
No, I do not go.
He's a menace.
Ya I figured you were a chicken.
I will not close the two doors.
Chicken, chicken!
Hen!
Join now if you do not want
Discovered standing there.
Open up, let me out!
I want out of here!
It's not funny!
Open, I want out!
Open!
Did you know that the United States has a
horoscope as a person?
Every 20 years, the planets
line up really bad.
The presidents elected during
that stage, died in office.
You should mention
in your article.
It is strange ...
Da ... think if our
lives are already designed.
It's an interesting idea.
What if we go for a drink and
we still talking about this?
I'd love to, but my
brother alone and I have to take care.
How do you do?
Reconnecting this and

Page 7/20

adding this to the circuit panel.
But look around.
Where did you learn?
Let me out!
Joyce!
- How are you Dad?
- Well, I'm fine.
- Everything under control?
- Clear
Can put Joyce
Timmy on the phone?
No, he's playing outside.
Do you get a lot of work?
No more than usual.
Help, somebody help me!
I'm locked!
Open up, please!
Somebody help me!
Dad and I will go
few days of hiking.
Great, Dad, you will do well.
Can you fix
alone for so long?
Take, for that
you're on vacation.
Timmy!
Timmy!
Where were you?
In the landfill. Curtis I
She locked herself in a refrigerator.
Timmy, you've come to the point that
or not you know when you lie.
I'm not lying!
How did you hurt your hand?
I told you, in the refrigerator.
Like when you were
feeding the dog.
Come on, I'll cleanse
before it becomes infected.
What did you really
Sunday night?
I was at Debbie.
At night??
Yes, but she was not home.

Page 8/20

Then why did you go?
Timmy, I know you're lying.
Tell the truth.
It's okay ...
Debbie has done a ...
hole in the closet ...
And charges 25 cents ...
to see Beverly ...
You know ... naked.
Wow, you're a voyeur.
I have not looked, really.
Debbie also was not.
You will not tell dad right?
No, do not worry.
Do not want you back
playing with Curtis ...
Not go to ...
dump right?
All right.
Do you promise?
Yes.
All right.
Here there is not enough silence.
There is not enough silence.
That ring is just a sign to
I tell you that you can go ...
But that does not ...
say they can go.
Now she will be silent.
BRODY COMMISSIONER DIES
TERRIBLE ACCIDEN Curtis, do not spy on people.
Was not spying, Miss Davis.
If you ever bring that
toy at school ...
I'll take it ... and do not give it back.
Okay, I will keep.
Why do not you do something useful?
Bring me some brushes.
Hey, Timmy!
Chicken, chicken!
Hen!
You two, stop it!
Stop it!
Curtis are you okay?

Page 9/20

Davis ...
Help.
Help!
- Are you really okay?
- Yes, I'll be fine.
Well, all right.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
JOYCE:
IN THE TRASH. TIMMY
You can not fulfill your
promise even a single day.
Hi Timmy what are you doing?
Nothing.
Fancy.
I have to go home and my sister
kill me if I'm late.
Do not be late.
Are only three.
Okay.
Will you do your party
birthday tomorrow?
Yes Have you ever played
doctors?
No.
Me neither. All
Anyway, I have no desire.
- How is it?
- I do not know.
I prefer baseball.
Bells Are Ringing
Do you want to drop to reply?
It should not be for
my sister silly.
Lives with the phone.
Whose is this book?
Mine.
What's it about?
It is a secret book.
- Like a diary?
- Yes
Well, goodbye.
Bye Bye.

Page 10/20

Timmy!
Timmy!
Timmy!
What?
Has anyone tried
run me over with that car.
Okay, we're going to take a look.
There's nobody here.
Before anyone was wearing and
a blanket over his head.
- A blanket?
- Yes, I wanted to kill me!
- Car number 10 ...
- Just a moment.
Duncan.
Damn, Duncan.
Where have you been?
It's called Deirdre Wilson, who
is near the cemetery.
Think you've seen
the psychopath lurking.
Roger, Dave.
We received a call
Cookie Lamar.
We have a suspect.
I repeat:
Police believe the tragic death
occurred today Ms. Davis ...
May be related ...
with the two crimes ...
Occurred in the cemetery ...
earlier this week.
Listen, Timmy, from tomorrow
I'll walk you to school.
I do not want to go
just anywhere.
Timmy, come home.
It's too late.
The deviousness and deception are
totally unrelated to your character.
Works precipitously and
you worry too much.
Who do you remember?

Page 11/20

- A Dad?
- Exactly.
You are concerned about your physical appearance ...
Are you sure ... yourself ...
And ... you are very seductive.
- You right?
- Wrong.
- Beverly.
- Yup!
It's amazing how much you can
a person wonder ...
I always though ...
They are bugging ...
Prohibindote ... and stuff.
God, hard to believe. A
type as hard as your father.
No wonder
want to forget.
Yes.
I think this time,
that is, it happened.
You here??
- They're all home.
- I do not care.
I want to forget.
This is Debbie's chart.
It is very strange.
The day he was born, there was an eclipse ...
And ... both the sun and the moon,
tapaban Saturn.
You must be missing something
in his personality.
Why?
Because Saturn controls his emotions.
By the way
treats people.
I think someone out there.
No one, nothing happens.
Go look.
What was that??
Is anyone out there.
Do not!
Do not!
Happy Birthday

Page 12/20

POISON FOR ANTS:
- I can not believe I read this.
- It's all true.
Beverly ...
Beverly.
You know your sister is charging
to see you naked?
What?
A gap.
Oh, no! I can not believe.
Joyce knows not
will stay quiet.
So what?
That they will believe.
If you think it is
crazy, you will not believe.
- What will you do?
- You'll see.
- Got it?
- Yup
Here it is.
Curtis.
Steven.
Debbie.
Now make a wish.
Three children are very
special do not you think?
I want to tell everyone ...
As ... I appreciate you ...
... Have come to wish them a
happy birthday children ...
There are ...
A person who ...
is with us today.
And I would have loved to be here ...
... With us.
Come on, Madge.
Come on everybody, let's
eat some cake.
It's great to see everyone having fun
despite what is going on.
It is a relief to be here.
Lately I have

Page 13/20

afraid to leave home.
Will they soon catch
that psycho?
We have clues, but we could
concentrate on anything specific.
Well, Joyce, and can
go get the cake.
Curtis.
You're making a mess.
We need another cake
Can you go look?
Yes.
What is it?
Look at that cake.
What are you hiding there?
- What did you do?
- Nothing.
Oh, no.
God, do not touch that cake!
Do not eat!
Do not eat that cake!
Do not eat!
Curtis put poison.
Do not eat the cake!
Curtis put poison ...
I did nothing.
The bottle of poison
I was in the kitchen ...
I just ... I was keeping it.
Not true, liar!
Be careful what you say.
Curtis has never lied.
One moment, Joyce.
What did you see?
I went to the kitchen and Curtis
I was decorating the cake ...
Had the manga ... in one hand and
in the other hid the poison.
You're crazy. Give me a
some of that cream.
- What do you do?
- I'll eat ...
You are crazy!
I cheated on you?

Page 14/20

- Is not it?
- Leave him alone.
You made me believe ...
You were poisoned ...
the cake is not it?
And you locked in
fridge! Is it not?
Leave him alone!
He has been nervous since
he found Miss Davis.
Curtis did not realize
that what is wrong.
- As if he had no feelings.
- This is Curtis, yes.
Maybe that's what's missing ...
... Consciousness.
Stay here.
Do you answer the door?
What?
You left the door
open yard?
Do not
Paul!
What are you doing here??
What do you mean by that?
Are not you glad to see me?
Yes, I really am happy.
And your tests?
I decided to take a break.
I missed you.
I love you too.
Timmy.
Dad told you to keep an eye on me right?
Clear.
Me too me
you said you watch.
Why not vigils me from your
room with the door closed?
Are you sure
everything will be fine?
Yes.
Think so ...
Next year ... we will be
two in college ...

Page 15/20

And ... no longer have to
worry about this.
I'm not going to college.
How do you mean?
I've been thinking ...
... What I really want,
is a journalist ...
And that you learn ...
better with practice.
I understand, but have time
practice in college.
All that has happened ...
It ... made me think ...
That ... from now on,
I'll do what I want ...
No ... plan it in advance.
Do you understand?
Right.
Debbie grabbed again?
my nail polish?
Debbie!

pruning shears ...
And managed before ...
Mom and Dad come?
All right.
