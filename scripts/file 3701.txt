With ideas

A thousand ways to woo

A lover so sincere

Love and hate

What a beautiful combination

Sending shivers

Up and down my spine

For every casanova

That appears

My sense of hesitation

Disappears

Love and hate

What a beautiful combination

Sending shivers

Up and down my spine

And the lovers

That you sent for me

Didn't come with

Any satisfaction guarantee

So I return them

To the sender

And the note attached

Will read

How I love to hate you

I love to hate you

[Creatures of nature

By riley keough playing]

The creatures of nature

Live nobly among us

The creatures of nature

Walk proud and stand tall

Friend of the redwood

The elm, oak and willow

Through winter and spring

And through summer and fall

The creatures of nature

Don't care if you like them

The creatures don't care

For your skyscraper scrawl

Stewards of forests

And rivers and mountains

All cohabituating

In grand guignol

To go against nature

Is to face its fury

From ancient pompeii

To hurricane paul

Chaos is order

The order of nature

Through winter and spring

And through summer and fall

La, la, la, la, la

La, la, la, la

La, la, la, la, la

La, la, la, la, la, la

La, la, la, la, la

They came here before us

And shall be long after

Till the world

Finally reaches

Its last curtain call
