Good morning, London!
It's a beautiful, sunny day.
Looking at the thermometer,
a very lovely 18 degrees.
We've got a classic tune coming up.
So, crack a couple of eggs
and put the toast on.
Carly?
Hey, sleepyhead.
You awake?
Morning, Dad.
Good morning, sweetie.
Want some breakfast?
Yeah?
Okay, see you downstairs.
What are you drawing, sweetie?
That's me, that's you, and that is Mommy.
That's beautiful.
Tell you what, why don't I put
this over there with the others
and you finish your breakfast? Deal?
Deal.
All right, hurry up. We're gonna be late.
All right, you have a good day at school.
Okay, angel?
- I will.
- Make sure you work hard.
- I always do, Daddy.
- Yeah.
- You know why?
- Why?
'Cause you got your mother's brains.
Okay, see you.
All right, sweetheart.
Good night.
Good night, Daddy.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
She's growing up real fast.
Miss you.
Hey!
...head up the stairs.
Check in the bedrooms.
Check in the kid's bedroom.

Page 2/24

I don't care. All right?
Just go. Fuck off!
Jesus Christ.
Daddy! Daddy!
- Shut up!
- No!
Carly.
- Stay down.
- Daddy!
Shut up!
Try anything, huh?
And bang.
- It's gonna be okay, sweetheart.
- On your knees.
- It's gonna be okay.
- Now!
Hands behind your head.
Take it easy.
Shut your mouth.
Look, whatever you guys want,
just take it and leave.
- Don't hurt my daughter.
- Shut the fuck up.
- She's just a kid...
- I said, shut the fuck up!
There's nothing.
Where is it?
Where is what?
Don't mess with me.
I don't know what you're talking about.
- The coke! Where is the cocaine?
- What?
What cocaine? What are you talking about?
I don't know anything about any drugs.
I am not fucking playing around, man.
I don't know what you're talking about.
- What are you doing?
- She is not going to want to see this.
No! No!
Hey!
Now listen.
I will put a bullet in your kid's head
- if you don't tell me where it is.
- Sorry.

Page 3/24

Please, don't do that.
Look, just listen to me, all right?
You got the wrong house.
No, man, I got the right place.
23 Kingsbury Grove.
No.
This is 23 Kingsbury Green.
This is 23 Kingsbury Green, not Grove.
Look, on the table behind you,
there's a utility bill.
It says 23 Kingsbury Green on it.
Look at it.
The utility bill! Look at it!
I told you, man.
23 Kingsbury Green.
Please, just don't hurt my daughter.
All right? Just leave.
I won't say anything to anyone...
You're not going to go to the police?
No, I'm not going to go to the cops, man.
Are we supposed to believe that?
If you go right now,
I will not say anything. Just go.
You've seen my face.
Don't do this, please. Don't...
Daddy!
I'm sorry, man.
Daddy!
You let her go.
Daddy!
Let her go, man.
Fucking let her go!
I'll cut her throat!
Daddy!
- I got you.
- Daddy?
- Daddy, don't go!
- I got you.
It's okay. It's all over.
- Did they hurt you?
- No.
- You sure?
- I'm sure.
I gotta make a phone call, sweetie. Okay?

Page 4/24

Daddy. You're bleeding.
Callister speaking.
Hello?
Daddy!
Daddy, wake up!
Daddy!
Oh, God. Yeah.
Yeah.
This better be important.
Ray.
We have a situation in London.
Tom's in trouble.
What?
Hey!
Hey!
What the hell is going on?
Where is my daughter?
You took several blows to the head.
Been out for almost 10 hours.
- You're lucky to be alive.
- Where's my daughter?
She's fine, Mr. Parker.
She's in good health.
I'm Detective Chief Inspector Quinn.
I need to see her. Where is she?
Kavendish Place, at Social Services.
Get me out of these cuffs.
Yeah, I'm afraid I can't do that.
Why?
'Cause you're under arrest for murder.
And I can't find any
record of your existence.
What the hell are you talking about?
Those guys broke into my house, all right?
They were trying to
kill me and my daughter.
Mr. Parker, you don't
have to say anything more.
Just know, if you do,
it might harm your defense.
Anything you do say
may be given in evidence.
Do you understand me?
It was self-defense, all right?

Page 5/24

I didn't have a choice.
Well, we'll see about that.
Hey, Carly.
Hi.
It's nice to meet you.
My name's Stacey.
What's that you're drawing?
I love your bracelet.
You know, I've got a necklace
that I always like to wear.
It was a gift from my mother.
This was my mother's.
My dad bought it for her before she died.
It's okay, sweetie.
You're safe now.
Bad men came into my house.
They hurt my dad.
He was just protecting me.
It's his job.
He guards things.
I know.
Where is he?
He's in the hospital, sweetie.
They're making sure he gets better.
And then can I see him?
...found in the oceans and seas
around the world. Humpback...
You didn't tell him you were pregnant?
No, I mean...
A neighborhood is in shock after
homeowner and father Martin Parker
took the law into his own hands and
reportedly shot and killed three intruders.
In this burglary gone wrong,
police are being unusually tight-lipped
about the prime suspect.
Emergency services
were quick to the scene,
but unfortunately not quick enough.
- The three young men were found dead.
- Oh, shit.
Gentlemen, I hear we have a problem.
Damn right we do.
That's unfortunate.

Page 6/24

These guns you sold me
are a piece of shit.
You have a nice way with words.
The guns are Chinese knockoffs.
I was promised quality.
That's why I came to you.
I can assure you these guns
are of the highest quality.
I ain't buying any guns.
I'm getting my money
and taking my business elsewhere.
Let's see.
Royal Bulldog, 9mm.
Yeah, I know what it is.
It don't work for shit!
Short recoil.
Accurate up to 50 meters.
Where's my money?
Where...
Works fine for me.
Mr. Cooper?
I just got sent a UK news story
from one of our sources.
You gotta take a look at this.
A neighborhood is in shock after
homeowner and father Martin Parker
took the law into his own hands and
reportedly shot and killed three intruders.
In this burglary gone wrong,
police are being unusually tight-lipped
about the prime suspect.
Where is he?
How much did you pay for that rock?
All right, fellas.
Boss says this is a private party.
Drinks are on the house.
Thank you very much.
One for the lady.
To the boys!
Cheers.
Yeah, that's it.
Oh, that is... There we go.
He's got her. He's got her...
Let me just hook that up for you.

Page 7/24

You're bad.
Give me some tips.
You've been schooled.
You've been schooled. Here we go.
All right, my turn, my turn.
Thanks very much, boys!
You're very welcome.
Come on. I'm going for a smoke.
See you in a minute, gentlemen.
Smoking will be the death of you, mate.
Bad for you.
She was so into you.
You're making money today.
Here you go.
Better all be there.
Go for champagne. Off you go.
Fucking machine.
You all right, sweetheart?
Not so fast.
Get 'em in. Get...
All right.
You ready, boys?
Hey, sweetheart.
Hello?
Mr. Bishop?
This is Charles Cooper.
Personal call.
This must be important.
Extremely.
I'm listening.
Martin Parker.
His real name is Thomas.
Thomas McKenzie.
He's an ex-federal agent.
- Time frame?
- Tight.
Then it's double my usual rate.
Deal.
One more thing.
He has a daughter.
It's for you. It's your lawyer.
- Hello?
- It's Ray.
Oh, Jesus Christ, Ray.

Page 8/24

My face is all over the news,
and I'm cuffed to a fucking bed.
- You need to get me out of here now.
- I will.
But you're being held for murder.
Yeah, I didn't have a choice.
Listen, I'm on a flight,
two hours out of Heathrow.
When I land, I can
explain to the authorities
the confidentiality
of your relocation in person.
Two hours? That's not good enough.
What about Carly?
I'm doing my best. Take my number.
Nurse, I need to write this down.
All right, done it.
- And, Ray?
- Yeah?
Where's Cooper?
We don't know.
- I need to get to Carly.
- Listen...
Sorry.
Sierra-Delta-7-5, officer down in Room 4.
Prisoner has escaped.
Hey!
Don't move!
Get down on the floor
and put your hands behind your back!
Hold it!
I said, get down!
That's not gonna happen.
Stacey?
I'll be two seconds.
We're moving the girl
to a secure location.
- Why?
- There's been an incident with the father.
He's dangerous.
He's put three of my men in the hospital.
I can go... You don't have to.
No, no, I'll go.
You're sure?

Page 9/24

The poor girl has no one.
The last thing she needs is someone else she
doesn't know taking her to a strange location.
- Okay, we need to go now.
- Okay.
Carly, we need to go on some travels.
Can you get your stuff?
Can I help you, sir?
Yeah, I'm Detective Chief Inspector Quinn.
Right. Let me see that again, mate.
You've got a girl here.
Blonde hair. Eight years old.
Where is she?
- I can't breathe.
- Answer the question.
Upstairs with Stacey, I think.
Which floor?
Third.
Excuse me, sir, can I help you?
Yeah, Detective Quinn.
Looking for a girl
who was brought here earlier.
Carly Parker.
Oh, I'm not sure.
You can try Graham's office, around the
corner, straight ahead, and on your right.
Are you Graham?
How can I help?
Hey, I'm Detective Quinn.
I'm looking for information
on a girl who was brought here.
I'm gonna need to see some ID, Detective.
Yeah, sure. Uh...
Tough day?
Excuse me?
Oh.
Yeah. Nothing I couldn't handle.
You know what, I, uh...
I think I left it in the car.
That's a shame.
Hey!
- Run!
- Get off me!
Thomas?

Page 10/24

You don't know who I am,
but you know what I am.
And I know all about your past mistakes.
Now, Mr. Cooper is paying handsomely
for me to bring you
back to him in a coffin.
He blames you implicitly
for what happened.
Hey! Taxi!
What the hell? I nearly killed you...
- Drive now!
- What?
- Move!
- All right, all right.
Hey, you in a hurry, then?
Something like that.
Is there any particular place
you want me to drive you to?
Just head south.
You American?
Which part?
Different places.
Are you... You on holiday?
What?
I said, are you on vacation?
I know a lot of good restaurants.
Do you like Italian?
My mate has this beautiful place.
It's right on the river.
They have spaghetti, pasta carbonara...
It's bad news, Ray.
- Where are you?
- I've just landed.
On the way to get my rental.
Tom has escaped police custody.
What?
They have no idea where he is.
And Carly?
She's been moved to a secure location.
Where?
They won't reveal.
Tom is still a wanted murderer.
This is bullshit.
We need to locate them, or Cooper will.

Page 11/24

I'll keep pushing through
the diplomatic red tape.
Just find Tom.
His last known location was Kavendish
Place, Social Services building.
Gotcha.
One call from me, and you are
booked on the best table there.
Hello?
This is the police.
Now I need you to remain calm.
Don't react to what I'm about to tell you.
Don't draw any attention to yourself.
Your fare is incredibly dangerous.
Now laugh.
What?
Just laugh as if I said something funny.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.
Good. Now where are you?
Yeah, I'm on the A112, mate.
Have you gone past the petrol station yet?
No.
Pull in there, and I'll be
with you in 90 seconds.
All right.
That was, uh... That was the wife.
She gets worried.
I, um...
Yeah, I need... I need some petrol.
There's a station up ahead.
Everything okay?
Yeah, yeah, yeah... No, yeah.
It's all fine. It's all good.
All good.
Yeah, I'll, uh...
I'll be really quick.
Shit.
Where are you?
Fuck!
Gotcha.
Oi!
Ten grand if you knock him out for me!

Page 12/24

It's good money.
Come on, let's do it.
Hey, you got a phone I could use?
Your phone. Give me your phone.
Oi, mate, we got a fucking phone for you.
He said 10K.
That's not a good idea, boys.
Hello?
It's me.
Where the hell are you?
Cooper sent someone after me.
I'm trying to shake him.
Where are you now?
- You got GPS?
- Yeah.
Okay, Royal Victoria Docks,
cable car terminal.
Meet me there in four minutes.
Seven minutes to destination.
Whoa, four minutes?
I'm counting on you, buddy.
Thanks.
God damn it.
Come on, Ray.
Come on, move!
Four minutes to destination.
Move!
Get in!
Motherfucker.
Oh, shit.
Jesus, Tommy, you're hit.
God. I'll be okay.
Who the hell was that?
Present from Cooper.
Oh, shit.
Where's Carly?
They got her in protective custody.
Apparently, I'm dangerous.
Here's the address.
- I'll check upstairs.
- Right.
Where are we?
We're just staying at this farmhouse,
just for tonight.

Page 13/24

I'm scared.
What?
I'm scared.
No.
Hey.
You haven't got to be scared.
I'm here, and I'm not going
to let anything happen to you.
Okay?
I miss Dad.
Everything's going to be all right.
Why don't we get you up to bed?
You must be tired
after the long day you've had.
Doesn't that sound like a good idea?
Yeah. Go on.
Move upstairs.
We've got Carly's location.
Where is it?
Old Oak Farm, TN8, 2JR.
Got it.
Tom, we're going to
get you out of this mess.
I'll have your arrest warrant rescinded
within the next 20 minutes,
an embassy detail dispatched
to Carly's location.
Just get to the safe house
while we arrange extraction.
That looks bad, Tom.
In or out?
Out.
I'm gonna get you
to a safe house in London.
- No. We're not going...
- Then I'm gonna get you patched up.
Then I'll take you to Carly's...
We need to go and get her now, Ray.
You're no use to her
if you bleed to death.
Fuck!
Now, I've got men who are on their way.
You and your daughter's safety
is my only priority.

Page 14/24

Why the fuck do you think I'm here?
I'm gonna get you fixed up, and you
and your daughter can be long gone
before Cooper and his present
even know about it.
Understood?
Yeah.
Yep?
Oh, come in, Sarge. What you got for me?
Oh, good news, sir.
Your work load has just got lighter.
What?
They shut the Parker case.
What the hell are you talking about?
You're off the case.
I've got three officers in the hospital
on account of this bastard.
And I've got three bodies on ice!
This is my case!
Not anymore.
This has come straight from the top.
- Diplomatic intervention.
- Nah.
No, this is fucking bullshit!
Call it what you like, sir.
It's done.
Fuck!
Mr. Cooper?
I must say, I'm disappointed.
He'll be dead before sunup.
There's nothing to worry about.
And the girl?
She was taken to a safe location
before I could get to her.
Where?
I said, where?
I'll know shortly.
You better.
I'm landing in 30 minutes.
I can walk.
Still the same old
stubborn son of a bitch.
- Which floor?
- The fifth.

Page 15/24

Nice place.
Yeah, well, the suite
at the Ritz was taken.
Where are you?
- I'm at the safe house with Tom.
- Good.
I need an update on Carly.
We're mobilizing agents
to her location as we speak.
Good.
But just make sure Tom is okay,
and we'll have him reunited
with his daughter within the hour.
What's the intel on
the guy that Cooper sent?
We managed to pull an ID
from the Emirate line CCTV.
Who is he?
Goes by the name Bishop.
His file reads like a one-man militia.
Learned his craft at MI6,
though the Brits won't admit it.
And for the last 10 years,
the black market has been his home.
He's the most dangerous assassin
Europe has to offer.
Comforting to know.
We'll be in touch.
Let's get you cleaned up.
The subject's name is Carly Parker,
and is located at Old Oak Farm, TN8, 2JR.
She must be brought back
safely to the embassy.
Any new intel on Cooper?
All we know is that he
slipped out of the country
when we moved you and Carly here.
I mean, he hasn't stopped working.
He's still supplying the Serbs,
the Croats, North Koreans with guns.
Anyone with money.
We just can't find the son of a bitch.
You getting so close,
it really spooked him.

Page 16/24

A guy like Cooper wants
to stay hidden, he stays hidden.
Yeah, well...
...he can't hide forever.
I admire your optimism.
This might pinch a little.
No, wait!
Westminster.
There you are, Thomas.
How you feeling?
I'll live.
I'll feel a lot better once Carly's back,
when this whole mess is over.
It will be.
Oh, and you can guarantee that?
It's not your fault.
Yeah, well, I don't see it that way.
You can't think like that.
She's dead because of me, Ray.
No, it was Cooper who did that, not you.
That car bomb was meant for me.
I'm the one that should be dead, not her.
You know, when I met Emma,
I was so deep into that world that
I didn't even recognize myself anymore.
But she was the one thing that
reminded me of who I actually am.
Now Carly's the only thing
that reminds me of who she was.
If I can't protect her,
then what?
You good?
Let's move.
Key!
Son of a bitch!
Ray, weapons?
Bedroom.
Clever.
- You ready?
- What's the alternative?
That wasn't the question.
Hello, Thomas.
Aren't you going to invite me in?
I know all about you.

Page 17/24

Fed who got in too deep
and ended up with a dead wife.
Fuck you!
Now, now, Thomas,
there's no need for unpleasantries.
You know, after I kill you,
guess who I'll be tracking down next?
I'll give you a clue.
Blonde hair,
sweet brown eyes,
a smile just like her mother's.
You see, my employer, Mr. Cooper,
he wants to get to know his granddaughter.
Carly, is it?
He feels it will go some way to replacing
the daughter you took from him.
You're gonna be dead before
you get anywhere near her.
Well, he'll be landing soon.
So, you can either open up
this door and die quickly,
or you can drag this
out and die painfully.
What's it going to be?
Like I said, fuck you!
What do you want?
Tom?
I'm good, I'm good.
Come on.
- Shh! Come on!
- No, go!
- I'll cover you.
- No.
Come on.
Oh, my God!
Keep moving! Keep moving! Come on.
Keep moving, come on!
Move!
How you doing, buddy?
Hanging in there?
Come on, talk to me, Ray.
I got nothing to say.
Oh, there's a first time
for everything then, isn't there?

Page 18/24

Go and get your daughter, Tom.
I'm gonna get you to a hospital first.
No.
There's no point.
You're acting like this is the
first time you've been shot.
Hey!
Hey, look at me, Ray. Ray!
Just keep the... Just keep
the pressure on the wound, Ray.
Ray!
God damn... Stay with me, Ray.
I'm sorry, man.
Sh...
- Hello?
- Stacey Miller?
Yup.
My name is Gail Callister.
I don't want to alarm you,
but I need you to listen very carefully.
I'm working with the US Embassy
and the British Police Force
and I've taken over the case.
What?
You can confirm with your superiors,
but I'm sending protective detail
to your location right now
to take care of you and Carly.
If Carly's father's coming here,
if he's dangerous, then I need to know.
Carly's father is a good man.
That's not why we're moving you.
Hand over the gun, slowly.
Now drive.
Sorry about your dead friend.
Shut the fuck up.
You're not going to kill me.
I am.
If you were, you'd have done it by now.
Only reason you're not dead is because
you're going to do something for me.
What was it like?
Undercover for five years,
being someone else?

Page 19/24

Must have been quite the thrill
trying to take a man like Cooper down.
Did you enjoy it?
Or you enjoyed fucking Cooper's daughter?
Kill the engine.
Give me the keys.
Get out.
Now.
Hands behind your head, fingers locked.
Very scenic.
Move.
She's very beautiful.
And so precious.
You'll be with her very soon.
You know, it's like
one of the universe's greatest jokes.
All the money, all the power,
and I'm chasing something I can't have.
Emma was the most important thing
in the world to me.
When I get my granddaughter,
I will make sure her father
is nothing but a distant memory.
I'm gonna call your employer.
You're going to tell him,
"Mission accomplished." I'm dead.
Then you're going to tell him
you have his granddaughter,
and you're going to arrange
to meet him right here.
One entrance, elevated positions.
Cooper's a sitting duck.
If I do what you're asking,
what's in it for me?
Maybe I'll let you live.
You think you got what it takes
to kill a man like Cooper?
'Cause I don't.
I don't give a shit what you think.
Just an observation.
Your friend tonight? Dead.
Your wife? Dead.
You don't want to kill me,
not until I've made that call.

Page 20/24

If I make the call, that is.
Well, maybe you should do it.
I'm sure Carly would love
to hear your voice one last time.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about Carly
and her grandfather's family reunion,
which I'm guessing
is going on right about now.
Bullshit.
You don't know where she is.
Impressive.
You know, Detective Quinn was quite
talkative until I put a bullet in him.
Old Oak Farm.
That's where little Carly is, isn't it?
You guys from the embassy?
Yes. We'll take it from here.
Thank you.
Okay.
Agents Boyd and Reid.
Hi. I'm Stacey.
The girl, is she asleep?
- Yeah.
- I'll get her.
Wait, no, I can go.
She's been through
enough the past few nights.
She's scared and alone.
We need to be out of here in 15 minutes.
Okay.
We have a problem.
Oh, fuck.
Dude!
Fucking bastard.
Carly?
Wake up.
I say we need to get going.
How long?
Five minutes, Charles.
We ready?
Yeah.
I forgot my bracelet.
You haven't got any kids, have you?

Page 21/24

We'll bring the car over.
Carly?
- Hurry up.
- Coming!
I believe you've been looking
after my granddaughter.
Your services are no longer required.
I can't find it!
Wait here.
I'll finish this up, Mr. Cooper.
I'm coming, baby.
I got it!
Don't be afraid.
My name is Charles.
I'm your mother's father.
Your grandfather.
Here.
Look.
You're my grandfather?
Yeah.
Do you know my daddy?
I know him very well.
He's a good friend.
He sent me to look after you.
You know,
you look so much like your mother.
My daddy says that, too.
You got kind eyes, just like her.
You know,
she was the most important thing
to me in the world.
She was very special.
Just like you.
I believe she's looking
down on us right now.
And you know what?
What?
I think she would be so happy
that we finally got to meet.
Hey, uh, what do you say
we get out of here, hmm?
Why don't we go somewhere hot,
where it's sunny all the time?
Like a vacation?

Page 22/24

Yeah.
Can Daddy come?
Of course.
Come on.
Carly, this is Hannah.
She's very nice.
She wants to be your friend.
Hello, Carly.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
Hey! Get him!
What was that?
Oh, uh...
Fireworks.
You know, they make me nervous.
Let's go to the living room
until they stop, huh?
He's gone into the barn!
You're a worthy adversary,
I'll give you that.
Don't worry, Thomas.
When you're dead, Carly will be
with her grandfather where she belongs.
It's been fun.
But this fight is over.
Fuck.
Looks like all those fireworks
have stopped, huh?
Yeah.
You like jokes, do you?
Let's go, Charles.
We're gonna be out of
this old place in no time.
Daddy!
It's okay, sweetheart.
I'm here.
What happened to your face?
Nothing, sweetie.
I'm fine.
Why have you got a gun?
It's just pretend, angel.
We were just getting to know each other.
Reminds me so much of Emma.
Don't you think?
Granddad and I are going on vacation.

Page 23/24

You can come, too.
He's not your grandfather, sweetheart.
- But he said...
- I don't care what he said.
Let her go, Cooper.
Drop the gun.
I want to go to my daddy.
Shut up.
Drop it.
I'm not going to ask again.
Do as he says!
I've waited a long time for this.
Daddy, I'm scared.
You...
I treated you like a son.
You took everything from me.
I gave you my daughter
and you betrayed me.
It's finished, Charles.
No.
Not yet, it's not.
Please don't hurt my dad.
You okay?
I'm okay, sweetie. Are you okay?
Yeah?
Come here.
I love you.
It's all right.
You're safe now.
Okay?
