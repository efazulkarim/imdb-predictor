BOTH:
Bye, L.A.!
Here we go.
AMANDA:
My friends are morons.
You better be careful or you might end up
in the Tower of London.
Criminal.
Ta-da!
But it's gonna be you.
-Forget the plane.
-This is backwards, by the way.
[WOMAN SPEAKlNG lN GERMAN
OVER PA]
CHRlS: And here in front of us,
we have the beautiful...
-...Danube River.
NATALlE: Uh!
We're doing Prague.
Hi, Paul! We're at the Tower of London!
Here we come, Kiev.
We're coming to see you, Paul.
[PAUL CHUCKLES]
PAUL:
You guys are ridiculous.
-Dude, it was so much fun, man.
-Yeah, l can imagine.
-Hey, ladies! You wanna put your stuff away?
AMANDA: Some place you got here, Paul.
PAUL: l'm never leaving. Best place ever.
Ain't it right, Chris?
-l got it, it's fine.
-l got it, l insist.
-Where are we sleeping?
-l told you, l put a pillow on the patio for you.
[MOCKlNGLY] "l told you,
l put a pillow on the patio for you."
PAUL: You're sleeping in my room!
Where do you think?
CHRlS: Great. Some chick still sleeping in there?
PAUL: Quite possibly.
l hope you cleaned those sheets.
Or burned them.
PAUL:
l heard that!
CHRlS:
So, Kiev, huh?
PAUL:
Kiev, baby!
l thought for sure your ADD
would have kicked in by now.
Dude, l'm telling you, man.
l don't think l'm leaving.
l love it here!
The chicks, they're fucking amazing.
They absolutely love Americans
and they are completely fucking insane.
Yeah, well, they have to be
if they want anything to do with you.
-So, Amanda.
-Yeah, okay.
-What? Chris! Come on.
-l knew this was coming.
Rob literally broke up with her three weeks
before we were supposed to come here...
...and Natalie had to drag her ass
onto the airplane.
PAUL:
Perfect! Look at her.
She's lonely, she's in Europe.
-You're a sick son-of-a-bitch.
-l'm not sick, dude!
Would you stop?
-Heh. Do l have a shot with her?
-No, you don't. Zero.
No? All right. Fine.
[CHUCKLES]
-l'll leave it alone.
-Thank you.
What about you and Natalie?
You guys going good?
-lt's creepy when you look at me like that, dude.
-Hold this.
Are you serious? Are you serious?
Yeah, dude!
l haven't asked her yet.
l'm gonna propose in Moscow.
-Does she have any idea?
-l hope not.
-What about Amanda?
-No.
That's awesome, dude.
[TECHNO MUSlC PLAYlNG

PAUL:
Unbelievable. A fucking riot.
Oh, man, thank you so much.
This was such a good night.
Yeah, it was.
Told you, man. Okay!
Save it for the apartment. Get a room!
Go to town, we're in Europe!
Don't listen to him.
-Whoa! You all right?
-Hello! Thank you, good save.
Watch out!
These cobblestones, they'll get you.
Thank you for being a good host.
We've had a lot of fun.
My pleasure.
You enjoying yourself in Kiev?
l am. Yeah, it's a beautiful little city.
Yeah, it's great.
Wait till Moscow.
Wait until you get to Moscow.
You believe me?
Mm. l don't know.
Do you trust me?
l don't trust you in those heels.
CHRlS: Paul. Hands off!
PAUL: Sorry.
[AMANDA LAUGHS]
AMANDA: You're trouble.
PAUL: l am trouble!
l can't promise what's gonna happen
at the end of the road, but-- Don't fall.
Those stairs are slippery.
NATALlE: Please, lock your door tonight.
l don't trust him.
-Christopher.
-Yeah.
-You are visiting your brother in Kiev.
-Yeah, well, l had to chase you down.
l didn't know when you booked this trip,
it was a one-way ticket.
l miss you, buddy.
Yeah, l miss you too, man.
lt's good to see you.
-How are things back home? Good?
-Yeah, things are great.
Mom's worried sick, of course.
You know how she is.
You spoken to Dad?
No, l, uh.... No.
-You should call him.
-l know l should.
-Paul, which way should we go?
PAUL: Left.
[THUGS SPEAKlNG lN RUSSlAN]

any trouble, seriously.
[SPEAKS lN RUSSlAN]
AMANDA: Come on.
-Don't touch me.
-Good night.
-Have a good night.
Good night. Bye-bye.
Come on, come on, come on.
Fucking losers.
CHRlS: Nice.
PAUL: Real friendly people here.
Don't worry about it.
We got a big day tomorrow.
AMANDA: Okay, l'm assuming that this is
the breakfast menu? But l don't know.
Excuse me, is this the--?
CHRlS: Yeah, she hasn't had her coffee yet.
-Wow.
Where's Paul?
He's supposed to help us with this.
l don't know, l just want something greasy.
Can you just point out
something greasy, please?
You need the Hangover Special.
Amanda, l want to apologize
for Paul's behavior last night.
Oh, please. He's fine.
l mean, l know the type, you know?
Just all talk.
Yeah, well, with him,
it's not always just talk.
l can handle him,
l'm not too worried about it.
And l'm sure,
deep down in there...
-Very, very deep down.
-...somewhere...
...he's a good guy, you know?
lt's just an act, that's all.
l mean, he's related to you, baby,
and you turned out all right.
-That's true.
AMANDA: Yeah, you're okay.
That's true. Just let me know
if l need to kick his ass for you.
-Thanks, dude, l appreciate-- Hello!
-Morning, children. How are you doing?
Fantastic. So l know l said
we're going to Moscow.
AMANDA:
Mm-hm.
But l'm gonna ask you a question,
and l want an answer.
The answer is already no.
You guys ever heard of Chernobyl?
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
lsn't that where
the nuclear disaster happened?
Yes. l met this really cool guy,
Uri, who's a, uh....
Have you heard of extreme tourism?
-Uh, somehow, l haven't, no.
-You guys see where this is going, right?
We're going to Moscow,
as we talked about.
PAUL:
Chris? Can l please finish?
So, there's this place called Pripyat. lt's a
town right next to Chernobyl. Uri, who is...
[lN RUSSlAN ACCENT]
...very excited to take us there...
[lN NORMAL VOlCE] ...is an extreme tour guide.
He's gonna show us this city...
...that was abandoned overnight.
Literally. They had no time to take anything.
Factories, schools, stores, homes,
apartments, everything's still there.
lmagine the photo shoot
you can have there, Amanda?
Yeah. But-- Okay, l hear that, but it's--
Radiation levels or something,
it's probably pretty dangerous, right?
No. We'll only be there for a day. A few hours,
see some cool shit and then we split.
-How are we gonna get there?
PAUL: Uri's gonna take us.
-He's got a van.
-A van?
-Yeah.
-He has a van?
He has a van!
Okay. Aside from the sketchy van situation...
...and if you promise that this tour is safe...
...l think it could be kind of cool.
-That's what l'm talking about.
-You're kidding.
No. l mean-- l don't know. He's right.
We're in Europe, we might as well see as
much as we possibly can while we're here.
l don't know.
-Tell me you don't want to meet Uri.
-l don't want to meet Uri.
How can you say that?
You haven't even met him yet.
We'll take some pictures,
explore a bit, and then we'll be on our way.
Just as planned. Right?
l don't like that he's rubbing off on you.
-He's definitely not rubbing off.
-You're incredible, you know that?
All right, let's just settle this
by a show of hands, please?
Who's coming with Paul to Chernobyl?
Yeah!
You're kidding me, right?
You guys are so weak.
All right, kids! Welcome to
Uri's Extreme Travel. Let's do it.
CHRlS: Uri's Extreme Travel.
-Uri!
[URl SPEAKS lN RUSSlAN]
What's up, buddy?
-How are you?
URl: Good morning.
-Come in! Welcome, welcome.
-All right, man! The gang is all here.
-This is my little brother Chris.
CHRlS: How you doing?
PAUL:
His girlfriend Natalie. The lovely Amanda.
-Guys, this is Uri.
AMANDA: Hi.
Hello.
l was telling them about our little adventure
today and Chris got parental, as usual.
So l figured you'd give him a little
peace of mind before he pisses his pants.
You're feeling nervous?
No, l'm not. l'm not nervous.
lt's a nice shop you got here,
it's very professional.
Thank you. lt's all mine.
-lt's all yours, huh?
AMANDA: Yeah, very nice.
-Yes, it's all mine.
CHRlS: Well, what are you, ex-military?
URl:
Yes, Special Forces.
What does it matter
if he's a fucking magician, dude?
-l'm just asking a fucking question.
-Okay. Uri, what's the plan for today?
URl:
Well, this is a very well organized tour.
l've been taking special adventurous
tourists for a while now...
...so you should feel very, how do you say?
-Special?
URl: Special, l like that.
Okay, so imagine, you have big city
and no one's there. All to yourself.
NATALlE:
ls it safe?
Of course it's safe.
This is not my first rodeo, Natalika.
-So sorry we're late!
-Well, now we're here.
Hey. You guys with the special tour, yeah?
ALL: Yeah!
-l'm Michael, this is my Viking Zoe.
CHRlS: How you doing? l'm Chris.
Nice to meet you.
What's up, man? l'm Paul.
Nice to meet you, buddy.
URl: Okay, we go!
MlCHAEL: We go now.
-Come, come.
MlCHAEL: All right.
CHRlS: Sweet.
MlCHAEL: We didn't keep you waiting?
PAUL: No. You guys are fine.
MlCHAEL: That's all l told you, go with the plan.
PAUL: So, tell me, what's up with
the whole "Viking" thing?
ZOE: He calls me that all the time.
l'm from Norway, so....
And he's my Australian surfer dude.
MlCHAEL:
All right, let's rock 'n' roll!
CHRlS:
Yes.
[PAUL CHUCKLES]
Yeah, buddy!
AMANDA: Are you kidding?
CHRlS: Wow.
That's what we're riding in?
-Might as well just...roll with it.
URl: Put your bags in the back.
PAUL:
Whoo!
MlCHAEL: First time, mate?
-Pripyat? Yeah. How about you guys?
Yeah. Someone said it's pretty fantastic.
Yeah, l heard it's pretty awesome.
-You two sweethearts mooning?
PAUL: "Mooning"?
AMANDA: We what?
-Honeymooning.
Yeah, actually, we are honeymooning.
We're just friends. Barely.
-Ouch.
MlCHAEL: You're cute.
-Are you guys?
-Oh, yeah, we're timeless.
No. A month.
You guys have only been together a month?
God bless.
-Wow.
-These two are practically married.
URl: We go.
PAUL: Shotgun!
AMANDA:
Thank you.
URl:
Anybody gets hungry, l have beefjerky.
Pripyat is two hours from here,
and Chernobyl is not far from there.
MlCHAEL: Good time!
NATALlE: What exactly happened in Chernobyl?
The Chernobyl disaster was a result
of failed systems tests.
lt caused sudden power surge.
And reactor number four
became one with the air.
NATALlE:
One with the air?
-Vaporized.
CHRlS: lt exploded.
[SPEAKS lN RUSSlAN]
l'm sorry, what does that mean?
Nature has reclaimed its rightful home.
[CHUCKLES]
URl:
Here we are.
Welcome to Pripyat.
Photo.
URl:
We're now entering exclusion zone.
CHRlS:
How long is it safe to be here?
URl: lt's very safe.
We'll only be in Pripyat for two hours.
What is this place? ls it like a checkpoint?
CHRlS:
Looks like it.
Why would there be a checkpoint
at an abandoned town?
MlCHAEL:
Tourists.
URl:
Okay.
-Let me do the talking.
PAUL: Oh, you think?
Put your cameras away.
AMANDA:
Yeah, got it.
MlCHAEL: Tough guys.
-Yeah. These guys look pretty serious.
MlCHAEL:
Yeah.
[SPEAKlNG lN RUSSlAN]
l don't know what they're saying,
but this guy is saying no.
PAUL:
Look at this guy.
AMANDA:
What do you think is going on?
ZOE: Ohh. Scary!
CHRlS: God, look at that guy. He's huge.
MlCHAEL:
Make sure he doesn't see me.
-How's that?
ZOE: Criminal soul.
MlCHAEL:
Do l look like one of them?
Uh, he is not letting us in today.
There's maintenance going on.
Maintenance work? l thought you said
this place was abandoned.
lt is unusual.
Usually, they let me know in advance
if something like this is going to happen.
Wait, l thought you said everything
was gonna be taken care of.
We paid for this tour, bro.
l know, l know.
Don't worry.
There's more than one way into Pripyat.
PAUL:
Make it happen.
AMANDA: lt's so bizarre,
l don't see any birds or anything.
This must be Uri's special entrance.
Paul, this looks fucking sketchy, man.
Stop being a pussy. We came all this way,
enjoy yourself, all right?
lt's called being sensible.
This is not right, you guys.
We're gonna end up
in a Ukrainian jail or something.
MlCHAEL:
Ahh! Come on, just think of it as an adventure.
ZOE:
lt's okay.
-This is the awesomest.
PAUL: Really?
[MlCHAEL CHUCKLES]
Okay, no problem.
Today we have Pripyat to ourselves.
CHRlS:
Sweet.
AMANDA:
All right.
URl:
Here we go.
AMANDA:
l was not expecting a lake out here.
URl:
And there is Pripyat.
Home to the workers and families
of Chernobyl.
AMANDA:
Wow.
CHRlS:
lt's incredible.
URl:
Hold on! This is going to be a little bumpy.
A little bumpy.
ZOE:
Oh, you're not gonna--
[ALL LAUGHlNG]
URl:
And down we go!
And up!
ZOE:
Oh, my God!
When are you putting seatbelts
in this thing?
-Jesus.
NATALlE: Or barf-bags.
ZOE:
Ridiculous.
Okay. Now, l want to show you
something in water.
PAUL:
He wants to show us something in water.
ZOE:
Thank you.
MlCHAEL:
After you.
URl: Stay close behind me.
-Like we're gonna go anywhere.
-Paul?
-Yeah?
l want you to tell me if you see
something moving in water. Okay?
Okay....
AMANDA:
You don't want to get your booties wet.
[URl YELLS]
PAUL:
Give me your hand! Give me your hand!
You okay? You okay, mate?
[LAUGHS]
MlCHAEL:
Funny, bugger.
-Are you fucking kidding me?
NATALlE: He's a fucking comedian.
-lt's jerky.
-Jerky, you jerk.
Can we go?
-Fucking got me!
-Yeah. He got me, too.
AMANDA:
Oh, shit!
MlCHAEL:
lt was a joke.
AMANDA:
Sorry about that.
Come have look at this.
PAUL:
ls this another joke?
URl:
No. No, come.
PAUL:
Holy cow.
URl: Don't get too close.
PAUL: Why? lt's dead.
NATALlE: lt's disgusting.
MlCHAEL: Look at the chompers on him.
PAUL:
What is that thing?
MlCHAEL: Touch it, mate.
PAUL: Whoa!
[NATALlE SCREAMS
& CHRlS LAUGHS]
Who's the pussy now, huh?
-Can we go? This is disgusting.
PAUL: Keep it up.
CHRlS:
Can we go? That's disgusting.
MlCHAEL: That's awesome.
-And moving on.
MlCHAEL:
See its teeth? lt's cool, huh?
ZOE:
Oh, my God.
ZOE:
Did you just make a rhyme, Uri?
URl: Yes.
-Ha-ha-ha.
Make small joke.
-Not to worry.
-Here is Uri.
CHRlS: So, Uri, how long has this place
been abandoned?
URl: lt's been 25 years. Only recently
have radiation levels gone down.
Man, this is crazy. lt's creepy as fuck.
URl: We are back on main road.
lt's only way in and out of Pripyat.
Yeah, except for your shortcut, right?
This is where the families of the workers
in Chernobyl lived.
MlCHAEL:
Wow.
-See?
MlCHAEL: Yeah.
-These were all full at one point.
URl: Yes. Very sad.
50,000 people, families, just left.
-Okay, hold on. Little bump, little bump.
MlCHAEL: Oh, wow.
[NATALlE GlGGLES]
-The Ferris.
ZOE: Bumper cars?
-All right. We're here.
MlCHAEL: l used to love those things.
Wow!
PAUL:
Still want to go home, Chris?
CHRlS:
l'm happy we're here. Thanks.
MlCHAEL: There we go. Brotherly love.
PAUL: You're welcome.
[CHATTERlNG]
Whoa.
CHRlS:
Guys, look at this.
Man.
Okay, everyone.
Stay near me and you'll be safe.
l have Geiger counter. lt will let us know
if the radiation levels are high.
That's good.
[BEEPlNG]
URl:
Levels are good.
Can you guys imagine this, like,
full with kids? Like...playing?
lt's really sad, actually.
PAUL:
They had no idea.
AMANDA:
Wow.
l mean, this is just unbelievable.
NATALlE:
l have never seen anything like this.
AMANDA: lt's like they were getting ready
for a carnival or something.
URl: They were preparing for "May Day,"
the celebration of Spring.
Never happened.
Okay, let's go. This way.
Can we get a photo?
Uri, you want to take it? A photo.
-Hey, guys?
CHRlS: All right. Quick photo.
And new friends.
URl:
Okay.
Good.
[lNAUDlBLE DlALOGUE]
MlCHAEL:
lt's so American.
[PAUL CHUCKLES]
ZOE:
ln a way it's like....
There was life, and it just....
Hey, you hear that?
Silence.
AMANDA:
lt's like nature really has taken over.
One last thing.
ZOE:
Are we going in?
URl:
Yes.
[ZOE GASPS]
MlCHAEL: What is it, babe?
Whoa, Zoe. Hey, babe, it's okay.
They usually don't come so close to town.
Must have been starving.
MlCHAEL:
l reckon he's right.
Come in.
NATALlE: That's disgusting.
MlCHAEL: That's the VlP entrance. Treatment.
[MlCHAEL CHUCKLES]
PAUL: Poor guy.
NATALlE: Are there any other animals here?
Unlikely. Especially during the day.
Just you. Heh.
[GROUP CHATTERS]
Stop it.
Here's one of a thousand apartments
that were abandoned.
MlCHAEL:
Cool.
The people were not even given five minutes
to collect their personal possessions.
You can't take that. lt's contaminated.
l was just look-- Spot the convict.
Cheers, man.
lt's contaminated.
For a while, people came here
and they looted through these buildings.
They took these things,
sold them on black market.
People who bought them got sick...
...not knowing they were contaminated
by radiation.
Sorry, l was just--
Come, let's have a look.
ZOE:
But it's okay to be here and breathe?
URl:
Yes, yes.
We're not here long enough
to get exposure.
Chernobyl Reactor Number Four.
Where the disaster happened.
PAUL: That's pretty close.
-Have you been inside?
No. You can only go inside
with radiation suit.
Only for short period of time.
Here, take picture.
MlCHAEL: Take a nice, romantic photo?
ZOE: All right, all right.
MlCHAEL:
Hey, l wasn't gonna....
ZOE: Yeah, he was.
NATALlE: This is going on the fridge.
-That's a metaphor here, by the way, guys.
PAUL: Do tell.
MlCHAEL: That's beautiful.
CHRlS: Our love is just exploding.
AMANDA:
Oh, God.
[ALL LAUGHlNG]
PAUL: The one good thing about the radiation
is that l'll probably finally grow a penis.
MlCHAEL:
These guys are funny.
ZOE:
l know, l know.
MlCHAEL: Can you beat that kiss?
ZOE: What?
[GROUP CHATTERS lNDlSTlNCTLY]
We should go now.
lt's going to get dark soon,
we should get back to van before then.
[CRASHlNG]
CHRlS:
What the fuck was that?
MlCHAEL: Right, it's gonna be a trick.
-Shh!
[CLATTERlNG]
[WHlSPERS]
Stay.
CHRlS [WHlSPERS]: What the fuck is it?
AMANDA: Shh, shh.
Holy shit! Go!
CHRlS [lN NORMAL VOlCE]: Jesus!
PAUL: Motherfucker!
AMANDA:
Oh, my God!
CHRlS:
Holy shit!
URl [lN NORMAL VOlCE]: ls everyone okay?
CHRlS: Don't fucking stand there!
URl:
Let's go, move, move, move!
CHRlS:
Go!
MlCHAEL: Fuck! What the fuck was that?
URl: Go, go.
MlCHAEL:
A bear? A fucking brown bear? Oh, Jesus!
ZOE: What is a bear doing here?
NATALlE: Let's get the fuck out of here.
MlCHAEL: Jeez.
AMANDA: Watch out for that.
PAUL:
Oh, fuck!
MlCHAEL: Okay.
PAUL: Holy shit.
NATALlE: Can we just get the fuck out of here?
AMANDA: Yeah.
-Thanks for that.
-Yeah. Don't mention it.
Told you it'd be exciting, didn't l?
Yeah, almost getting mauled to death by
a radioactive bear from hell? Pretty exciting.
Anybody else have a story like this?
NATALlE: Funny.
AMANDA: You okay?
Anyone get a photo?
-A photo. This guy.
-Jesus.
[ALL CHUCKLlNG]
PAUL:
Bear! Bear, bear! l'm kidding.
ZOE:
That's bad.
So, Uri, all the animals,
they stay in the woods, huh?
lt's very unusual.
l've been doing this for five years.
-l've never seen anything like this.
-Kind of chilly out here, huh?
A dog, a wolf. But a bear, very odd.
lt was exciting, right?
-Yeah, mate.
-No extra charge for bear attack.
Say goodbye to Pripyat.
-Ciao.
-Yeah, ciao-ciao.
Hey, Christopher?
Moscow! Thank you.
MlCHAEL: l'll have to get your e-mail, eh?
-Yeah, for sure, dude.
-Catch up again? l'll be back to Kiev.
-Done, dude.
lt was a blast.
Turn the heater on, buddy.
[ENGlNE SPUTTERlNG]
Pump it.
Give it some gas. Give it some gas.
What's up, is there gas in there?
Yes. Half a tank.
ls it the starter, mate?
Has this happened before?
CHRlS: l don't suppose you guys
have AAA out here?
ZOE:
Do you have reception?
MlCHAEL: l haven't had reception all day, guys.
There's no kind of reception out here.
-Look, look.
-What the fuck does that--?
What the fuck could've done that, mate?
That's fucking been chewed on.
NATALlE:
Wait, what's happening?
ZOE:
What's going on?
-The wires have been destroyed.
-Chewed on.
What do you mean chewed on?
What kind of--? What, by what? An animal?
What kind of animal chews on car parts?
Are you sure we're out here alone?
Yes. You heard the soldiers this morning,
this place is off-limits.
We are here alone.
CHRlS:
What the fuck is it, Michael?
MlCHAEL: That's the sparkplug leads,
been chewed on...
-Can you call someone?
-...by a raccoon, a rat, or some animal.
NATALlE:
But how would an animal get in here?
MlCHAEL:
Under the car. Through the engine.
AMANDA: Underneath?
MlCHAEL: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKlNG lN RUSSlAN]
AMANDA: He said there aren't any around here
and all of a sudden--
CHRlS:
l don't know.
Guys! Let's just shut up and let him--
We're trying to--
[STATlC OVER WALKlE TALKlE]
Fuck me.
MlCHAEL:
Uh....
Uri?
What's the plan, mate?
Hey, big fella? What's the plan?
[SPEAKlNG lN RUSSlAN]
ZOE:
l'm so hungry l could die.
PAUL:
Well, this is great.
Gotta hand it to you.
Some fucking tour, mister.
URl:
This is not my fault.
PAUL:
Oh, really? Not your fault?
Because last time l checked,
you were the one that drove us out here.
NATALlE: lf it weren't for you,
we wouldn't be here either.
PAUL: l'm sorry to try and show you guys
some fun while you're out here visiting me.
CHRlS:
Oh, yeah. Lot of fun.
PAUL:
Hey, Chris.
All right, you know what? Relax.
-We're fine.
-We're fucking stranded out here.
And don't tell me to relax.
l swear to God, this is the last time
l listen to one of your dumb fucking ideas.
You know what, Chris?
Your fucking whining isn't helping right now.
NATALlE: He's got every right to be pissed.
AMANDA: Okay, guys. Hey, Uri.
Someone has to know
we're out here, right?
l work alone.
[PAUL CHUCKLES]
PAUL:
Fucking great.
So, tell me, Uri.
What are our options right now?
We stay in van.
NATALlE: Are we safe here?
URl: Yes, we're safe.
We close windows, lock doors.
