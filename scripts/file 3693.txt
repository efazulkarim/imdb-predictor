[Horns honk in distance] 
Anna: 
Are you even... 
Will: 
just give me a second. 
[Both speaking indistinctly] 
Okay. 
Okay. 
- Okay? You want me to... 
- Yeah. Just give me a second. Just give me a second. 
Okay. 
Okay. 
- Oh. 
- Ah. There we go. 
[Bed thumping] 
I love you. 
[Grunts] 
You're so perfect. 
I love you. 
Just stay like this. 
Just... 
Just stay like this forever. 
Okay. 
I love you. 
Oh. Careful. 
Careful. 
[Grunts] 
[Both breathing heavily] 
- See, I told you. 
- It was quick. 
[Both laugh] 
Congratulations. 
Thank you. 
Is that a record? 
[Laughs] 
I don't want to get 
anything on the sheets. 
[Sighs] 
Will you get me 
something? 
Phew.

Towel. 
Thank you. 
- There we go. 
- Phew. 
[Sighs] 
Ooh. 
Mm. 
- Where's the remote? 
- Hmm? 
You have the remote? 
No, I thought you had it. 
Oh, yeah. 
- Yep. 
- Yeah. 
[TV turns on] 
I love you. 
I love you. 
- Good night. 
- Good night. 
[Dog howls] 
Dr. Bennett: 
looking forward to your thesis drafts. But first, Anna... 
30 is a milestone. 
Say goodbye to your youth. 
Great. 
- Surprise, Anna. 
- Surprise! 
- Happy birthday, Anna. 
- Thanks. 
- Happy birthday! 
- Thank you. 
Anna, you are the most 
beautiful thing I... 
I have ever seen... No. 
Anna, I... 
want to be with you 
for the rest of my life, 
and I hope you do, too? 
- [Horn honks] 
- No. No. 
No, no, no, no. 
Pbht! 
Page 3/71
- Hey. 
- Hello. 
Happy birthday! 
[Laughs] 
Mm! 
- Don't panic. 
- What? 
- Oh. 
- 30's just the beginning... 
of the end of your life. 
Ooh! 
Oh, it's big. 
I cannot wait 
till you see this. 
Yes. 
Oh, that is scary. 
[Laughter] 
Look at that hair! 
Look at you. 
- You look so handsome. 
- Whose arm is that? 
Thought you could probably use some art for the new house. 
New house? 
Somebody say new house? 
- Huh? Huh? 
- Hey, we're right on schedule. Okay. Okay. 
All right, we're nowhere 
near on schedule... 
- Thank you. 
- ...but listen, I screwed up, made a few crucial 
miscalculations, you know. 
Just not this one. 
- Aww. 
- [Chuckles] 
- That was nice. 
- Thank you. 
- It was good. 
- It was good, right? 
- Good save. 
- It was good, right? 
- Thank you. 
Page 4/71
- Oh, my God. 
You know what I was thinking 
about coming here tonight? 
Summers at the lake. 
- Really? 
- Mm-hmm. 
Like how our parents 
left us up there, you know? 
I mean, they should be here 
tonight, Mom and Dad. 
Hey, look, they are who 
they are, and we love them. 
It just reminded me that you 
covered for them, so thank you. 
- Oh, my God, and we'd gossip about boys... - Yeah. 
...and your crush on Teddy. 
- For Will. 
- No, Teddy. 
- Ted... for Will. 
- [Laughs] 
Sorry. 
Teddy Fredricks? 
Teddy Fredricks. 
- You remember him. 
- With the giant neck? 
- No, he did not have a giant neck. - This guy had a giant neck. 
- It was huge, Reece. 
- He was just very strong. 
He was like an orc. 
You knew I had 
a crush on Teddy. 
No, I did not. 
My point is 
we were inseparable. 
God, you guys met 
when you were babies. 
We were babies! 
First loves 
and still together. 
Never been with anybody else 
your entire lives. 
It's so crazy. 
Page 5/71
- And it killed me because I thought... - Come on. 
- ..."I'm gonna be alone for the rest of my life." - All right. 
But then 
you introduced me to him. 
Now, if you could just convince 
this one to knock me up, 
that would be lovely. 
[Laughter] 
- They should be here tonight. 
- William. 
- Mm-hmm. 
- I'm not trying 
to call you out 
in front of your someday wife, 
but when we were 
in the dorms freshman year, 
you told me you'd 
already amassed 
quite a few notches 
on your belt. 
Really? 
Is that right? You did? 
I-I lied. 
Wow. 
- It's a weird lie. 
- Reece. 
- I was 18. 
- We shared a bunk. We had a bond. 
- Come on. 
- It wasn't enough to... 
No, it's just I was 
a quiet farm boy, 
and you were so fucking cool 
and impressive. 
- I wasn't enough. 
- No, it's not that. No. 
It's just he had a tattoo, 
he had all the best drugs, 
he'd already fucked 
so many... 
you'd already fucked 
two Congressmen. 
Page 6/71
- Together, as well as separately. - [Laughs] 
- I'm a uniter. 
- Oh, okay. 
I wanted you to like me, 
so I lied. 
Well, it's disappointing. 
We've made up for it 
since. 
- Only with her. 
- What? 
- [Scoffs] 
- You know what, Reece? 
Our sex life, we don't need to because our sex life is... 
is really, really great. 
Compared to what? 
Reece. 
I mean, Anna, if you've never 
had anybody but Will, 
I say find out what 
another cock feels like. 
- What? 
- Reece. 
Don't you want to know? 
Aren't you curious? 
You must be. 
I mean, really, come on. 
The two of you 
are so perfect 
and constant and inevitable 
and fucking boring. 
You practically 
already have babies. 
- Live a little! 
- Okay, come on. 
Don't you want to be the guy 
you pretended to be in college? Aren't you gonna be 
a little disappointed 
if you die 
and you never were? 
Anyway, look, 
there's no risk. 
Page 7/71
You two... 
You two love each other. 
You love each other. 
You're a monument to love 
that will stand for all time 
and I toast you 
and I love you. 
- Oh, cheers, Reece. 
- Thank you very much. 
- Thank you so much. 
- [Laughs] 
Well... 
[Clears throat] 
Um... 
Following that, 
I was... 
Uh, I was going to... 
give you a set of keys 
tonight. 
But the house 
isn't finished, 
so no keys, sorry. 
Um, but I-I will say, 
um... 
Anna... 
I could look at your face 
for the rest of my life, 
and, um... 
I love you. 
I-I love you. 
Happy birthday. 
[Rock music plays] 
Will: 
You liked Teddy Fredricks. 
Anna: 
Yeah, before you came along. 
Did you journal about him 
and his thick neck? 
Yeah, I was scared, 
but he... he wanted me. 
- Oh, how Victorian. 
- [Laughs] 
Page 8/71
Wait, this is after 
we were together? 
Yeah, it was kind of a standing offer until college. 
- Really? 
- Sure. 
And? 
Uh, we moved to Naples 
and got married. 
I-I chose you. 
But you were into Teddy. 
That is... [Scoffs] 
What? I was curious. 
I mean it's not... 
You... You've been attracted 
to other women. 
I mean... 
Yeah, not... 
- Well... 
- Well, no, not more than you. No. 
Okay. 
Points for that. 
Mm. 
Thank you. 
I suppose, 
you know, you just... 
[Sighs] 
I w-wanted experience. 
And I got in the way. 
Obviously not. 
[Siren wails in distance] 
[Joan as Police Woman's 
"Human Condition" plays] 
Hale: 
sometimes, you know that? 
Whatever. 
I shouldn't drink champagne. 
[Laughs] 
Yeah, 
I think you just think 
you're way funnier 
than you actually are. 
Page 9/71
- Nonsense. 
- No. 
- I'm very funny. 
- Oh, yeah, you are? 
- Mm. 
- I think we can agree to disagree on that one. You'd be lost without me. 
Hey. 
- Hmm. 
- Hey. 
- What? 
- Mm. 
I meant what I said 
earlier. 
About what? 
About having a baby. 
I want to have a baby. 
- How about a puppy? 
- Come on. 
Mwah. 
Can we have the bill, 
please? 
Reece, 
that's not a waitress. 
Oh, fuck. 
Human, human, human, 
condition 
Ow! Careful! 
Human, human, human, 
condition 
Will: 
Would you? 
W-Were you thinking about... 
about this the whole time? 
- No. 
- About... About... 
- No, I just... 
- ...my crush on Teddy Fredricks? 
No, I'm just curious. 
I was just curious. 
- What do you mean? 
- Hmm? 
What do you mean 
Page 10/71
you're curious? 
- Yeah. 
- Are you asking asking? 
Hmm? 
I don't know. 
No, I... 
I'm just... 
Maybe. 
I'm just... 
I don't... 
[Scoffs] 
[Car alarm wails in distance] 
[Door closes] 
Will: 
that shit last night? 
I don't know. 
I'm sorry. 
It was fucking stupid. 
I was very drunk. I'm sorry. 
Sorry about Reece last night. 
He had a... 
- Oh, whatever. 
- Yeah. 
He had a lot to drink 
before we went out. 
- No. Really? 
- [Laughing] Yeah, he did. 
How many guys were you 
with before Hale? 
I have no idea. 
Well, like, a number. 
More than you, considerably 
less than a thousand. 
- And Hale was the best? 
- No. 
Anderson Cooper... 
avarice bottom. 
It doesn't bother me. 
I know he was joking. 
Will: 
being with anyone else? 
No, not really. 
Page 11/71
Not seriously, no. 
I mean, with Hale, 
it's comfortable. 
There's common cause. 
That's everything. 
It's not like I feel like 
I'm missing out or whatever. 
Will: 
if you live till you're 90, 
Hale is the last person 
you'll ever fuck? 
Yeah. 
Gun in my mouth, 
I say absolutely. 
Ow. 
Ooh. 
- Yep. Yeah. 
- Ooh. 
There's 
a little more to go. 
[Both grunting] 
There you go. 
Good job. 
[Piano music plays] 
[TV news chatter] 
You think it's, like, 
fate, what we have? 
Hmm? 
What? 
Nothing. 
[Sighs] 
Will: 
How's the sushi? 
Am I holding you back? 
What? 
Do I... 
[Sighs] 
Are you satis... 
satisfied w-with... with me? 
I'm sorry. [Chuckles] 
I don't understand. 
[Sighs] 
Page 12/71
Look, you have one life, 
and I would never, never, 
never want to stop you 
from doing something 
if, when. 
Theoretically, 
it would be okay, I think. 
It would be... 
I think I would be okay. 
Can you say what you mean? 
[Mid-tempo music plays 
on stereo] 
I think that you should 
sleep with other women. 
I mean, just if we're... 
if we're 
gonna be together 
forever... 
You think I want to? 
[Clears throat] 
Look. 
I know how much you love me 
and always will, 
so why shouldn't you, 
right? 
I mean, if I love you 
as much as I do, 
then I shouldn't 
be threatened by that. 
- I couldn't be. I mean, I know it's just... - Do you want to? 
I don't know. 
[Glass shatters] 
[Somber music plays] 
- Monogamy is stupid, okay? 
- Uh-huh. 
That is... That is the part 
of what you said 
- that makes sense, okay? 
- Right. 
Not that I... I mean, no, 
but you... 
- [Siren wails] 
- You're... You're right. 
Page 13/71
- It's... It's bad design. 
- Sure. 
At least, 
it defies all logic. 
It's just... It's just crazy 
that w-we've never 
- talked about this, that's all, you know? - Right. 
I mean, we just did 
what we were supposed to. 
- Yeah, 'cause we were so youn. 
- Right. How did we know? 
I don't want you to want me 
because you have to, you know? 
I want you to want me 
because you want to, 
not because 
I-I own your body. 
Well, you can own 
a little bit of it. 
You think I want 
to own a little bit of it? 
[Melancholy piano music 
plays] 
[Dog howls] 
[Espresso machine hissing] 
[Pleasant music plays 
on stereo] 
Okay, so, look. 
Last night, that was weird. 
Yeah. 
Are we gonna try it? 
Okay, if we were gonna 
do it, what we... 
what would 
we even call it? 
An open relationship? 
No. 
The relationship's not open. 
- No. No. 
- The relationship's just you and me. Right. 
That's what I meant. 
You can just fuck 
Page 14/71
other people. 
Ah. 
As could you, 
obviously. 
I don't think 
it's gonna work. 
Well, why not? 
Uh, human nature, 
thousands of cautionary tales 
preceding you. 
That's not us. 
How come this 
has never come up before? 
Been with each other 
for, like, a billion years 
and never thought about 
fucking someone else? 
Well, no, of course 
I've thought about it. 
I've been attracted 
to other people. 
God, you've only been with, 
like, one person 
your entire life. 
Ugh! It's biblical. 
It's Shari'a. 
Fidelity has value. 
It's why it's such 
a common measure 
- for evaluating a relationship. - [Sighs] 
I get that you want 
to evolve beyond jealousy. 
I don't think it's possible. 
You want to be with Reece 
forever. 
Is that a question? 
Do you? 
No. 
I would like 
to be with Reece 
for as long as we make 
each other happy. 
But yes, given that, 
Page 15/71
forever is ideal. 
You remember 
Shannon and Jeremy, right? 
They had, like, 
an open relationship. 
Yeah, in college. 
Yeah, and they're still 
together. 
They have kids now 
and everything. 
- Doesn't count. 
- [Scoffs] 
- You're still attracted to Will, right? - Yeah, of course. 
- Anna? 
- Yes. 
And the sex 
is still good? 
Yes. 
I mean... I think. 
- [Sighs] 
- You think. 
Will: 
You are saying 
that with all the years 
you've spent with Hale, 
everything you... 
you have together, 
the love, 
the trust between you, 
the intimacy, 
shared belongings, 
your life, everything, 
is so fragile 
that if he were to sleep 
with someone just once, 
it would erase 
everything you've built? 
- Yes. 
- That's ludi... That is ludicrous. Why is it such a threat? 
'Cause he's mine. 
You sound like a child. 
Page 16/71
That is a child's answer. 
William, 
I love you dearly. 
This is very stupid. 
I'll see you tomorrow. 
[Hale whistles] 
Go get him. 
- What's his name? 
- Oh, it's Bowzer. 
He's a little rowdy, 
but he's a good boy. 
I meant, um... 
- Oh. Yeah, Aidan. 
- [Laughs] 
- He's darling. 
- Thank you. 
This is actually 
the only place he sleeps, 
but Bowzer likes it, 
too. 
Mm. 
You got any kids? 
Uh, no. 
No. 
Uh, too busy. 
I run a garden center. 
- Oh. 
- Plants. 
- Yeah. 
- Yeah. 
It's like having 
a bunch of kids, right? 
Yeah, yeah. 
Yeah, well, 
your dog's like a kid. 
Axel, yeah, 
he's my sister's. 
Oh. 
I'm Hale. 
- Hi. Glenn. 
- Hey. 
[Machine clanks] 
Shit. 
Again? 
Page 17/71
Third time this year. 
I hate this machine. 
[Upbeat music plays on stereo] 
Hi, there. Let me know 
if you have any questions. 
It's incredible. 
The smell. 
Oh, that? That's cedar. 
He's, uh... He's sanding. 
Well, I can smell it 
all the way down the block. 
Oh, really? 
I have an exceptional nose, 
though. 
Oh. 
Looks like it. 
That's a... 
It's a great nose. 
[Laughs] 
Did you make this, 
this table? 
Yeah, the two of us 
make everything 
right here 
in this store. 
Pretty impressive. 
Thank you. 
Is that your boyfriend? 
That? 
No, that's my... my partner. 
My... My business pa... 
He's my best friend. 
- [Machine whirs] 
- That's very cool. 
[Chuckles] 
Very, very beautiful. 
Wait. 
Uh... 
Want to take 
a piece of this? 
You know, you can burn it 
like... like incense 
if you need a fix. 
[Laughs] 
Page 18/71
That's very sweet. 
[Sniffs] 
Thank you. 
- All right. 
- I'll do that. 
I'll see you around. 
Enjoy. 
Thank you. 
You too. 
Bye. 
Yeah, I want you 
to understand... 
Reece: 
I loved that. 
Of course. 
What? 
It was great! 
There was so much talking. 
I cried twice. 
[Laughing] I know. 
You're so emotional. 
Whatever. 
You love me. 
Yeah, well... 
- Want to go out? 
- Hmm? 
- Let's go out. Come on. Come on. - It's late. 
- Let's go out. Let's go dancing. - It's late. 
Let's go dancing. 
It's not that late. 
- Let's go dancing. 
- I've got orders... 
- We're not old. 
- ...to fill for tomorrow morning. We're young and beautiful. 
Let's dance. 
I've got work to do! 
Let's go dancing Tuesday. 
Fuck Tuesday. 
- All right. 
- Okay? 
Page 19/71
- Tuesday. 
- Okay. Good. 
Can't believe 
you didn't like the movie. 
Well, 
I do have questionable taste. 
[Laughing] 
Hey, get back here. 
Anna: 
I thought we were going. 
What's the rush? 
Hmm? 
I don't know. 
Silly me, I'm breaking 
You sure you're ready 
for this? 
Yeah. 
You? 
Why did I have to let it 
come to this? 
Silly me 
I'm aching 
Why did I trust the sky 
When I am near 
Here I am waiting 
Silly me 
Silly me 
When I'm with you 
[Sighs] 
[Laughs] 
What? 
Do you see anyone? 
No. Don't be... 
Don't be so obvious, okay? 
Okay. 
Sorry. 
- You look great, though. 
- Yeah? 
- Yeah, fantastic. 
- Yeah, so do you. 
Thank you. 
Uh, you want to 
go take a lap, explore? 
Page 20/71
- Sure. 
- Yep. 
I'll go this way, 
you go that way? 
- Okay. 
- All right. 
Careful. 
I'm so sorry. 
Let me get that. 
Shit. 
I'm sorry. 
[Sighs] 
[Applause] 
Man at keyboard: 
Uh, I'm gonna take a break. 
Hey. 
H-Hi. 
I like 
what you're wearing. 
["The Magic" plays on stereo] 
- Oh. 
- What do you do? 
What... What do I... 
I... You know... 
[Inhales deeply] 
- You live close by or... 
- Hey, babe. 
- Well, no. 
- They were out of Stella. 
Hey. 
I'm, uh, the fianc. 
So, uh, you are...? 
Ian. 
Against the marquee 
Nice chatting with you. 
[Chuckles] 
I am divine 
[Laughs] 
- Yeah. 
- [Laughs] 
- Sorry to... 
- Thank you. 
...break up the fun. 
Page 21/71
No, no, no. Thank you. 
That was, uh... 
- He was... He was, uh... 
- Yeah. 
- It was awkward. 
- Yeah, I saw the look on your face and... Fianc? 
What, a little... 
little strong? 
Well, maybe. That's a... 
That's a big move. 
Yeah, I'll admit, 
I might be pushing our 
fake relationship too fast. 
Well, yeah, you might. 
I haven't even met you, so... 
- [Laughs] 
- Vicious technicality. 
Wait. Are you... Are you 
afraid of fake commitment? 
Yeah, I'm terrified. 
All this time, you think 
you know someone, and... 
Yeah. 
Beer? 
Yes, 
I will take a beer. 
Release me from my maze 
I am makin' myself 
[Music echoing] 
It's on the, uh, 
history of female composers. 
Well, then, to finishing 
your thesis. 
And you to finishing 
your, uh... 
I don't know, laundry? 
- [Laughs] 
- I'm Dane. 
Oh, yeah. 
Hi. I'm... I'm Anna. 
- ["More Than This" plays on stereo] - Oh. You dickhead. 
- What? You love this song? 
Page 22/71
- I do. 
- Hi. 
- Hey. 
Oh, I'm so... I'm sorry. 
I'm such an idiot. 
Sorry. This... 
This... 
is my friend, Will. 
Hey. 
Dane. 
Dane? 
Dane? 
Dane. 
Great name. 
Thanks. 
It's crazy... I lost 
my virginity to this record. 
- No way. So did I. 
- You did? That's so weird. 
So did... So did... 
So did she. 
Crazy, huh? 
How do you guys know each other? 
Both: 
We went to school together. 
- Mm-hmm. 
- Way back when. 
Shit. 
I love this song. 
You dance? 
- Yes. 
- We should dance. 
- Will. 
- All right. Come on. 
Come on. 
We can dance. Let's dance. 
Will! 
More than this, nothing 
[Chuckles] 
Oh, shit, my jacket. 
I'll be right back. 
Oh, okay. 
You ready? 
Page 23/71
For what? 
To go home. 
You don't want to. 
[Scoffs] 
You like him, 
he likes you. 
So... 
Well... what... 
what about you? 
Well, I'll go home. 
He's pretty cool, right? 
You are into him, 
clearly, so... 
You know, 
he's a great dancer. 
Well, maybe I'll just 
take his number or... 
[Door opens] 
Our work here is done, guys. 
We changed the whole vibe. 
Hipster assholes 
are dancing. 
- [Laughs] 
- You guys got one more in you? Yeah, I don't have 
such an early morning. 
Great. 
You know, I might... 
I might take off. Uh... 
You know, you guys... 
you guys go have fun. 
All right? 
All right. 
Okay. Are you... 
Are you sure? 
Yeah. 
I'll, uh, 
I'll see you, Anna. 
[Chuckles] 
[Sirens wailing] 
Dane. 
I'll get her home safe. 
Shall we? 
Yeah. 
Page 24/71
[Declan McKenna's "Bethlehem" 
plays] 
- So 
- Night. 
You've left it all 
behind you 
For love 
is only as you see it 
[Flames crackling] 
Oh. 
Wow. 
[Chuckles] 
This is cool. 
What can I get you? 
I'll... I'll take a... 
whatever you're having. 
[Chuckles] 
Huh. 
This is it. 
What's, uh... 
What's this? 
Uh, that was, uh... 
That was a long time ago. 
- It's yours? 
- My old band. 
You remember that song 
"Drops of Jupiter?" 
Uh, y-yeah. 
Yeah. 
Yeah, they, uh, they knocked us off the charts, so, um... 
Oh. 
[Purse thuds] 
So, um... 
now you... 
do something with... 
computers? 
Do you really care? 
No. 
Not really. 
[Exhales sharply] 
[Chuckles] 
[Clothing thuds]

- Oh, wait. 
- What? 
Uh, I just, uh... 
I just, uh, um... 
Can I just use 
the bathroom? 
Yeah, it's, uh... 
You're almost there. 
Okay.

Man on TV: 
of 87 London Terrace 
- was completed on schedule... - [Cellphone chimes] 
...despite the protest 
of many local residents 
and preservationists. 
14 tons of dynamite 
were detonated. 
Everything all right? 
Uh-huh. 
Just, um... 
one foot 
in front of the other. 
[Music stops] 
You don't 
have to rush out. 
- Um... yeah, I... 
- No, really. 
[Chuckles lightly] 
[Keyboard playing] 
Anna: 
[Chuckles] 
Y-Yeah, I, um... 
- I have s-school tomorrow, so... - Ah. 
And, uh, what's that like? 
Your tomorrow? 
Uh... 
I s-should go. 
Uh, I didn't mean... 
Page 26/71
Oh, no, no. I wasn't say... 
T-That was, um... 
I just... 
I should go. 
[Pen scribbles, clacks] 
I'll be staring at my phone 
until you call, 
but no pressure. 
I-I should... 
I should go. 
Yeah. 
[Music stops] 
[Paper thuds] 
[Music resumes] 
Hey. 
You okay? 
Yeah. 
Yeah. 
You? 
I'm good. 
[Chuckles] 
How was it? 
Hmm. 
It was, um... fun. 
It was... 
Is that okay 
for me to say? 
Yeah, yeah. 
It was really fun. 
Well, good. 
Good. 
That's... 
That's so good. 
- [Chuckles] 
- That's... 
Yeah, he was... 
he was great. 
It was... weird. 
Different. 
Looser. 
It was... 
just different. 
But you... 
you're okay? 
Page 27/71
Yeah. 
Yeah, 
I'm... I'm great. 
Wow. 
[Sighs] 
Wow. 
[Chuckles] 
It worked. 
[Chuckles] 
[Chuckles] 
[Sirens wail in distance] 
Looser? 
[Scoffs] 
Yeah, just... 
Um, like he was... 
I don't know, 
like, um... 
everywhere at once 
and all over the place. 
Um, but it was... 
it was just fun. 
Like, am I s-stiff or... 
No. 
No, you're great. 
You're the standard. 
Did you do everything? 
A lot of things. 
[Sighs] 
Great. 
Yeah. 
Yeah, it worked. 
It was just fun. 
Yeah. 
- It went well? 
- It was better than that. 
Okay, please, 
spare me the details. 
- You guys are fucking crazy. 
- No, he was nice. 
- He was nice to her. 
- I'm glad of that. 
- And Will? 
- He was fine. 
I think he was fine. 
Page 28/71
This was all your idea. 
He's a composer. 
He played me one of his songs. - Okay, you can't see him again. - Why? 
Look, sex is sex, 
and that's great, you know, 
but that's what 
you agreed to. 
Just... 
Just be careful. 
Reece: 
a suicide pact, right? 
You have to do it now. 
You're committed. 
Otherwise, she's out there 
on the hook forever. 
You're so dramatic. 
You know that's literally 
the worst thing 
you can say to a gay man? 
What are you staring at? 
Hale: 
Hi. 
Oh. 
Hello again. 
Hello again. 
Um, so, I'd like 
to buy this table. 
Really? 
This... Wow. 
- Yeah. 
- Okay. 
Well, that's, 
uh, that's great. 
I know. I-I couldn't get it 
out of my mind, actually. 
Let me just take 
your details down 
and schedule a delivery. 
I'm available right now. 
Oh. I... 
Page 29/71
Well, I... 
I'm kind of, you know, 
the store's open, and... 
- [Pencil clatters] 
- Mm-hmm. 
Well, why don't you 
just close the store? 
I... 
I'm totally kidding. 
I could be free tonight. 
Oh, well, I could also 
potentially be... be available 
to deliver this table 
to your address. 
Well, then, 
it's potentially a date. 
[Pencil scribbling] 
[Door closes] 
Hi. 
Oh, hey. 
Were you watching porn? 
No. 
- You watching weird shit? 
- No. 
- Animals or something? Tentacles, eggplants? - [Laughs] 
No. 
Nope. I got to go. 
I have drinks. 
Bye.

- The doorman let me in. 
Lydia? 
Wow. 
It's... It's Will. 
Where do you want this table? 
Oh, yeah. 
Yeah, it's perfect. 
- Oh, hi. 
- Hey. 
Cool place. 
Thank you. 
["I Defy" plays on stereo] 
That's better, huh? 
[Remote clacks] 
Can I get you something 
to drink, maybe? 
Iced tea or white wine? 
I'm... I'm fine. 
- How could it be different? 
- Mm. 
I'm obsessed 
with this stuff. 
[Chuckles] 
[Humming] 
How could it be different? 
Now I'm kissing the real you 
Now I'm kissing the real you 
[Both chuckle] 
You want to dance? 
Will I get through 
my dark day? 
- S-Sure. 
- Mm-hmm. 
Can you hear me? 
I like this music. 
Yeah. 
[Sniffs] 
You smell like my father. 
How could it be different?

asshole. 
Sorry. 
Fuck. 
[Music ends] 
[Footsteps approach] 
[TV chatter] 
- Hey. 
- Hey. 
[Sighs] 
I made dinner. 
Oh, you cooked? 
Huh. 
Uh... 
You didn't call. 
- Yeah, I'm sorry. 
- Don't. 
Just fucking 
don't do that to me. 
Why? 
I-I went to the house. 
Till midnight 
with your phone off? 
No. 
I... met somebody. 
And then I went 
to the house. 
You fucked someone 
in our new house? 
No, I-I went there after 
to work. 
Right. 
But I'm suppo... 
I mean, you're supposed to 
tell me when you're gonna... 
I-I was worried 
Page 32/71
about you. 
[Sighs] 
I'm sorry. 
What's her name? 
[Sighs] 
[Fork clacks] 
Lydia. 
Lydia. 
Great. 
Cool. 
I'm sorry. 
I should've called. 
I-I didn't 
do anything wrong. 
Yes, you did. 
Lydia is... is great. 
Lydia is probably 
a great person. 
I'm... not angry 
with Lydia.

It's an earthqu...

Oh, my God. 
What? 
I'm sorry. 
I'm sorry. 
- [Groans] 
- I'm sorry.

Don't worry. 
It's gonna be okay.

Tsunami! 
[Laughs] 
[Muffled] 
I can't breathe! 
So, Lydia... 
where did you meet? 
- At the shop. 
- Huh. 
She bought a table. 
Excellent customer service. 
- Not my best, actually. 
- Why? 
Well, it was 
just kind of scary. 
She was looking at me 
all naked. 
S-She had big hands. 
It was weird. 
Did you enjoy it? 
I guess, after a while. 
After a while? How many... 
How many times did you... 
Oh, just once. 
Oh. 
Oh, you lasted a while. 
We did it on the table, 
which was weird. 
I couldn't... 
I couldn't finish, 
so I... I panicked, 
and I faked it. 
You faked... Wait, 
how is that even possible? 
What did you, 
just spit on her back? 
No. 
No, I just, like... 
- Oh, that's very convincing. 
- Thank you. 
- [Chuckles] 
- Did you have to pretend with, uh... - Dane? 
- Mm. 
- No. No. 
Page 34/71
- No? 
- You just... 
- No. 
What, you didn't feel 
like pretending or...? 
No, I... [Sighs] 
I don't know. 
I was probably 
just nervous and... 
Right, right. 
It's just friction, right? 
Right. 
You should see her again. 
- Hmm? 
- Lydia. 
I don't know. 
You want to see him again? 
Yes. 
All right. 
[Dogs barking] 
Come on, Axel. 
Axel, no! Bad boy! 
Go over there! 
- Oh, hi again. 
- Hey. 
- Hi. 
- Hi. 
Yikes. 
I think I just passed out. 
Is he sleeping 
any better for you? 
Oh, God, no. 
No, no, not at all. 
I tell you what... 
I would trade my apartment 
for six hours of uninterrupted sleep at this point. 
- Wow. That bad? 
- Yeah. Yeah. 
You know, I-I write, 
so my office has been 
turned into a baby's room. 
It's a little tough 
with deadlines 
Page 35/71
and things like that 
to sort of... 
You want to hold him? 
Yeah. 
- Yeah? 
- Sure. 
Take a seat. 
Hey, Aidan, I'd like 
to introduce you to Hale. 
Hale, Aidan. 
[Laughs] 
Hi, Aidan. 
Hi, baby. 
You must be so much fun. 
He's so... 
[Snoring] 
He's sleeping. 
What do you think 
he's dreaming about? 
Oh, I bet it's you, too. 
I bet it's you, too. 
Hale: 
Where's the check? 
I don't know. 
This place fucking sucks. 
I'm never coming 
to Chelsea again. 
Hey. 
Are we gonna talk 
about it? 
Are you growing 
a moustache? 
[Chuckles] 
Um... yeah? 
Yeah? 
Yeah, I just thought 
I'd try something new. 
It's a little bit 
like the... 
like the creepy kid 
in gym class. 
I don't know what 
you're talking about. 
Page 36/71
Just... Just very fond 
of your upper lip as it was. 
Oh, thanks. 
It's a compliment. 
Where's the fucking 
waiter? 
I'm gonna ruin 
their lives on Yelp. 
Reece, calm down. 
I mean, don't... 
Don't you think 
they're fucking crazy? 
I mean, Will and Anna? 
I mean why risk what they have, right, I mean, for some... 
- If they're not happy... 
- Yeah, but aren't they? 
Like, are they not happy, 
or are they just bored in bed? - Famous last words. 
- Yeah. 
[Both panting] 
I love you so much. 
[Chuckles] 
Reece, 
can we have a baby? 
- What? 
- Why would you do that? 
Why would you say that 
right now? 
Why can't 
you just be with me? 
Reece. 
[Sighs] 
Will: 
Is he bigger than me? 
Seriously? 
[Sighs] 
Okay. 
Um, he's somewhere 
between... 
like this and like this. 
[Chuckles] 
Page 37/71
Come on. 
Are you... Are you thinking 
about his now? 
No. 
[Shoe thuds] 
I mean, 
yours is nicer, honestly. 
Is he better, though? 
Come on. 
You're being silly. 
- Was he? 
- It was different. 
- Different better? 
- Different different. 
I don't know. 
He wasn't... 
He wasn't careful 
with me, which is... 
[Sighs] 
Reece: 
ever talk about kids? 
Will: 
Did she say something? 
No. 
Just wanted to know 
if I'm framing out a nursery. 
It's a closet. 
[Drill whirs] 
But you want 'em? 
- Yeah, sure, eventually. 
- Really? 
When this is done 
and she's finished her degree, I guess it would be good. 
Yeah, 
I guess that makes sense. 
Hey, man, those... 
those braces aren't straight. 
I can see it from here. 
It's solid. 
It's gonna be covered over. 
It's fine. 
Page 38/71
- I'll do it myself. 
- It's a closet! 
All right. I'll redo it. 
I'll redo it. 
It's fine. 
I'll redo it. 
It has to be perfect. 
[Both breathing heavily] 
Want to stay over? 
We... We don't 
have to do anything. 
What, we could just 
sit there in silence? 
Sure, if you like, yeah. 
We could also talk or, uh... 
Well, you could tell me 
about your thesis. 
I can pretend 
to understand, and... 
- I'd love to, but... 
- [Sighs] 
Make you breakfast 
in the morning. 
I should really go home. 
No. 
No, you really shouldn't. 
[Faucet squeaks] 
[Drain gurgling] 
Sorry. 
I didn't mean to push it. 
Just... 
Just tell me 
you feel it, too. 
One foot 
in front of the other. 
Dr. Bennett: 
I don't understand, Anna. 
This thesis draft 
is far below your potential. 
You're still writing 
like a performance major, 
not a music history scholar. 
What's going on with you? 
Page 39/71
- [Muffled] Anna. Anna! 
- I'll find you... 
[Music continues indistinctly 
in headphones] 
Are you all right? 
- Yeah, I just... 
- [Headphones clatter] 
I got to... 
Got to go. 
Don't like that piece? 
Sorry, 
I-I didn't see you. 
It's all right. 
I'm barely here. 
- It is a divisive work, provokes a response. - Does it? 
I agree, there are 
far more beautiful things 
in the gallery 
at the moment. 
[Woman singing indistinctly] 
Need a coffee? 
Want coffee? 
Neither should be 
Yeah. 
Be right back. 
Actually, 
I don't need a coffee. 
Why don't you 
give me your number? 
I'd like to see you again. 
You gonna tell your wife? 
Uh... no, I'm not. 
So you... you have 
an agreement. 
What she doesn't know 
she doesn't have to agree to. 
You know, 
she might not mind. 
Just... give me 
your number. 
No. Look. 
Unless you tell her, you... 
You have to... 
Page 40/71
You have to get her permission. I already told you, 
that's not how we are. 
Well, 
I guess it's how I am. 
Not according 
to recent events, it's not. 
Look, I'm not gonna ruin 
my marriage for you, okay, 
so thanks for the fuck, 
but Jesus. 
I'm sure you remember 
where the door is. 
[Horns honking] 
Another one already? 
- Yeah, it just... it just happened. - [Sighs] Wow. 
Oh, can you just... 
[Both sigh] 
[Sighs] 
- You okay? 
- Mm-hmm. 
Should we just... 
You want to... 
you know, should we just stop? Is it worth it? 
Hmm? 
No. 
No, I'm okay. 
Really. 
You're okay? 
I'm okay. 
Well, 
if you're okay, then... 
[Sighs] 
I'm okay, so... 
You want a drink? 
I could go and... 
No, I'm... I'm kind of tired. 
I want to go home. 
- [Sniffles] 
- Really? 
Yeah, I don't want to... 
- You... You can stay... 
Page 41/71
- I might. 
- ...if you want. 
- I might do that. 
Okay. 
Well... 
See you at home. 
Yeah. 
See you at home. 
['80s pop music plays] 
Done nursing that ice water? 
Oh, it's... it's mescal. 
Not anymore. 
Rocks? 
S-Sure. 
[Ice clinks] 
Hey, I have to work 
tomorrow, so... 
Oh, yeah? 
What's your work? 
I teach high school. 
Hmm. 
Good kids,

And where's your wife? 
My what? 
Oh, that's my girlfriend. 
She's at home. 
- But you're here. 
- So it seems. 
Well, 
it you want to pull, 
all you have to do 
is stick around 
and drastically lower 
your standards.

Oh. 
Oh, God. 
Oh.

- Mm-hmm.

Anna: 
I'm not asleep. 
Good drink? 
[Sighs] 
No. 
Hmm. 
It's late. 
Sorry. 
Fuck. 
That's a lot of money. 
Yeah. 
They're all like this. 
Surrogacy's expensive. 
It's not expensive. 
That's a fucking fortune. 
Can we at least 
talk about it? 
When you shave your moustache, you can talk about it. 
- Can you be serious, please? 
- I am serious. 
Can we try 
to figure this out? 
You're so fucking stubborn. 
Don't I get a say in the matter? You would if you 
ever talked to me. 
Has it ever occurred to you that there might be a good reason 
why I don't want to do it 
or why I'm hesitant to do it? 
If it's about the money, 
we can try fostering. 
Foster kids come damaged. 
Adoption... they can 
come take them away. 
We have lives! 
We have a life 
that we built. 
Look at it! 
Can you picture 
a child in it? 
Yeah, well, I was trying. 
Page 43/71
You haven't thought 
about any of this, have you? 
It's some... It's some 
beautiful fantasy for you. 
Yes, I've thought... 
I've thought about it.

eventually.

the delivery receipt? 
- Yeah. 
- Good. 
Ms. Gretel Winthrop? 
That's a funny name. 
She was nice, though. 
Yeah? 
How nice was she? 
I'm starting to fear for the 
safety of our female customers. You come in for a bookshelf, 
might get more 
than you bargained for. 
- Not today, okay? 
- Old bird like that, though, 
I guess she won't mind 
that you're an amateur. 
You don't have to be 
an asshole. 
- I'm not trying to fuck everyone I meet. - Oh, yeah? 
What was the road 
to Hell paved with? 
Remind me. 
Because it's working, 
does that... 
- does that threaten you? 
- No, man. 
Shit would never happen 
in my house. 
This doesn't threaten me. 
Just makes me sad, that's all. 
You still seeing 
that other lady? 
- Lydia? 
Page 44/71
- Yeah. 
Yeah. 
Care about her at all? 
Sure. 
Of course. 
What's she do? 
What are her interests? 
Where's she from? 
Nothing? 
You know what? 
Fuck you. 
I guess you know 
who the asshole is, huh? 
You gonna leave me 
to drive back 
'cause I hurt 
your fucking feelings?

- Hi. 
Hi. 
Oh, wow. 
You're... 12 hours early. 
[Laughs] 
Oh, you meant 9: 
I can come back. 
No. No, you're here. 
- It's okay. 
- Right. 
It's just, oh, my God, 
the place is a mess. 
We haven't finished. 
Inga, det racker nu... 
det racker nu. 
You can finish. 
Finito. 
Okay. 
You don't have 
to have so much attitude. 
Did you see that? 
Makes me feel so insecure 
Page 45/71
about my Swedish. 
I don't think 
that's Swedish. 
Well, I mean, it might 
be a little Norwegian, 
but it doesn't matter. 
Well, you just... 
you caught me. 
I was in the middle 
of doing my new workout. 
It's... a little bit of yoga 
and folding laundry. 
I call it "yolaundry." 
[Both chuckle] 
Well, I've never been 
on a date this early before. 
Um... 
So, um, here. 
Let me take your coat. 
Oh, thank you. 
Yeah. 
Did you have anything 
special in mind? 
No plans, exactly, 
but, um... 
You know, we didn't really 
talk much last time, so... 
Well, um, you want 
to get to know each other? 
Exactly. Yeah. 
Really well? 
The way you movin' 
on the floor 
Yeah. 
What's that look for? 
You ever sometimes feel like 
just, you know, 
like going wild? 
[Chuckles] 
I mean... 
- Yes. 
- I'm never gonna give you up 
I'm makin' up my mind 
Oh. 
Page 46/71
Yeah. 
Don't worry. 
I know the girl 
who made them. 
Oh, I'm not... 
I'm not worried. 
Yeah? 
Tell that to your face. 
[Both chuckle] 
What are they? 
Um, 
probably a lot of fun. 
Are you serious? 
I know you're mine, 
mine, mine 
- Hmm? 
- All right. 
Yeah? 
[Laughs] 
You're fucking lovely. 
Hmm. 
You think so? 
- Mm. Yeah. 
- Hmm. 
[Tall Heights' "River Wider" 
plays on stereo] 
You're a big softy. 
Is that... 
Is that bad? 
Mnh-mnh. 
Nothing's bad. 
Oh, my God, 
my whole damn world 
We should, you know... 
We should, like, 
be friends, you know? 
If you're... 
If you're wo... 
- [Laughs] 
- Oh, wait, what? 
Should I stop talking? 
No. 
You're fine. 
Yeah? 
Page 47/71
You're so... perfect. 
The first time we had sex, 
I didn't finish. 
Really? 
It's not you. 
I... You're beautiful. 
You're beautiful. 
I just... 
I-I couldn't. 
- We should fix that. 
- Really? 
'Cause, like, you know, 
that's... 
Sometimes 
that happens with Anna. 
Who's Anna? 
I want to feel 
like this all the time. 
Why don't I feel 
like this all the time? 
Because you have 
a stick... 
up your ass. 
That was definitely 
your finger. 
- Shut up. 
- Oh, my God. 
I don't... 
I don't know if I can. 
Yes, you can. 
Listen. 
What do you want to do 
to me? 
Ooh, whatever you want. 
- No. 
- Sorry. 
- Shut up. 
- Ooh, sorry. 
What do you want? 
Hmm? 
Anything. 
- I... 
- Anything is allowed. 
- But I... 
Page 48/71
- Do it. 
- Um... 
- Just do it. 
- I... 
- Come on. 
- But... 
- Just do it. 
You can do it. 
Just do it. 
Come on. 
Come on. Come on. 
Oh. 
Oh. 
Wow. 
[Voice breaking] 
I'm so sorry. 
- No, no. 
- [Crying] I'm so sorry. 
No. 
It's okay. 
- I'm so sorry. 
- No, no, no. 
It's okay. 
Shush, shush. 
- I'm so sorry. 
- It's okay. 
All along the way 
I'll find you 
I'll find you 
And all along the way 
I'll find you, 
I'll find you 
And all along the way 
I'll find you, 
I'll find you 
And all along the way 
I'll find you, 
I'll find you 
[Utensils clack] 
Dane: 
You look different. 
[Whisk scraping] 
I do? 
Page 49/71
I'm sure it'll pass. 
[Plastic crinkles] 
[Scraping continues] 
[Keyboard plays] 
[Food sizzles] 
I didn't know 
you could play. 
Not very well anymore. 
Thought it was what 
I was gonna do, but, uh... 
Now, keep going. 
[Chuckles] 
No. 
What are you... 
What are you doing? 
Since I know you're not 
gonna stay the night, 
might as well 
make you breakfast now. 
Really? 
No charge. 
Compliments of the house. 
Part of the service. 
You're really good, 
and to think all this time, 
I've just been 
using you for your body. 
Is that what's happening? 
Mm-hmm. 
Can I kiss the cook? 
- Come here. 
- [Squeals] 
Lydia: 
Don't you? 
I haven't felt 
this good since... 
I don't know, 
since my divorce. 
[Scoffs] 
Danny, Danny, 
Danny, Danny. 
Um, I'm Will. 
I'm talking about my ex. 
Page 50/71
Right. 
- You idiot. 
- I'm sorry. 
No, you just think that you... that you meet the one, right, 
but there can't 
just be one. 
How can there 
just be one? 
I don't know. 
I was a dental hygienist 
before I met him. 
I guess I could get 
a dog. 
I could... 
I could travel. 
Can I... 
Can I ask you something? 
[Sobs] 
The table... 
Do you really like it? 
Oh, my God. 
The table is so beautiful. 
Yeah? 
I love it. [Sniffles] 
It's just so honest. 
And I can love the table, 
and I can want to fuck you. 
One doesn't diminish 
the other, you know? 
Cool. 
And I think we should 
do this all the time. 
Like, a lot. 
Like, once a week. 
It's so... 
It's so good to do. 
Mm. 
You should have some of this. 
I really wish we had, like, 
a fresh coconut, 
you know what I mean? 
[Food sizzling] 
[Laura Marling's "Worship Me"

Mmm. 
Mm-hmm. 
- Good? 
- Mm. 
Don't you cry and wish... 
Okay, you can be honest. 
You have a kid? 
Huh? 
- It's God 
- You a spy? 
You need 
No, whatever it is, 
it's fine. 
It's God you need 
No. 
I don't have a kid. 
[Chuckles softly] 
We're young 
I keep thinking 
I'll never see you again. 
Every time is like this, 
and then... 
then you vanish. 
And need something 
to put our hopes up 
I see something in you. 
Need something to protect us

the abstinence. 
I have a headache. 
- For a week? 
- It's persistent. 
[Scoffs] 
It's very big of you, this. 
How long is this gonna go on? 
- Go to bed. 
- Answer me. 
I just did. 
Go to bed. 
Anna: 
Will, are you okay? 
Mm? 
Why's the TV 
out in the street? 
[Footsteps approach] 
I moved it. 
What? 
You should 
really see this. 
The hell is going on? 
It's really something, right? 
Hey, we should get a telescope. - How cool would that be? 
- Okay, you're drunk. 
No, come here. Just... 
Just sit down. Just relax. 
- Will. 
- Give me your... Just give me your feet. - We have to talk. 
- Just relax. Just look at the stars. - [Sighs] 
- Just give me your feet. 
- Listen to me. I was just... 
- Just give me your feet. 
- Shh. Give me your feet. 
- ...with... 
Mm-hmm. 
Shit. 
Were you with Dane? 
You smell like him. 
Yeah, I was. 
Page 53/71
I was with Dane. 
It's pretty amazing, 
right? 
Like, anything 
is allowed, right? 
- Yeah, Will... 
- Anything you want, you just do it. Just do it. 
- Sure. 
- You know? 
Whatever you want 
to do to me, 
you know, you can 
just do it, right? 
I mean, there must be something you want to do to me 
you just always 
wanted to do... 
- No. 
- ...you haven't told me. 
- No. 
- Come on. Just... 
Why? 
Are you, uh... 
hiding something 
right now? 
What? 
Because we know everything 
about each other, Will. 
- Yeah. I don't mean... 
- Yeah. 
So, what are you trying 
to say? 
I... 
Did you know that 
I want a telescope? 
Hmm? 
No. 
[Clears throat] 
Okay. 
So you have secrets 
that I don't know. 
Well, don't you? 
[Sighs] 
Page 54/71
No. 
- Anna, it's... I... 
- No, I don't. 
- Will, just tell me. What is it? - It's nothing bad. 
Well, then, why have 
you never told me before? 
- I just... 
- Will, come on. What? 
I just always wanted 
to spit in your mouth. 
What? 
Out of context, 
I guess it sounds weird. 
W-Why? 
I-I don't know why. 
Y-Y-You... 
You want to s-spit on me? 
I just think 
it's... it's sexy. 
[Voice breaking] 
It's disgusting. 
Why would you want 
to do that? 
No, no. 
I don't want to... 
No, I just... I'm sorry. 
I don't want to do it to you. 
- I just... 
- Y-You don't? 
- No. 
- Why not? What's wrong with me? - Nothing. 
- Why don't you want to spit in my mouth? I do. I will. 
I just... 
Only if you like it. 
W-Will, I-I want you 
to want to spit in my mouth? 
Now? 
No! 
No, no, no. 
I'm sorry, no. 
- [Sobbing] 
Page 55/71
- No, I'm... I'm sorry. 
I'm sorry, too. 
I love you. 
- I love you, too. 
- I love you. 
- I love you. 
- I love you. 
- I love you. I love you. 
- I love you. I love you. 
[Sniffles] 
God, you stupid fuck. 
[Sighs] 
Hey. 
I'm going. 
You didn't notice. 
Can we talk about it now? 
I got to go. 
[Door opens, closes] 
[Sighs] 
Shit. 
[Birds chirping] 
[Dogs barking] 
You ever miss 
your life before having him? 
No... 
is what you're 
supposed to say. 
But sometimes, yeah. 
I just used to have all this, 
um... my freedom, 
but it's been cannibalized 
by this guy. 
- [Chuckles] 
- Yeah. 
But then he does 
something cute 
with a spoon 
and some applesauce, 
- and it doesn't matter. 
- Right. 
But don't get me wrong... 
it is hard as shit, you know? 
But you get through it. 
You thinking about it? 
Page 56/71
- Yeah. 
- Yeah? 
For a while. 
Cool. 
Well, what's stopping you? 
I don't know. 
You'd make a great dad. 
You think? 
Yeah. 
I mean, don't listen to me. 
Look at this guy... 
he loves you. 
Well, thank you. 
And thank you. 
[Door closes] 
[Melancholy piano music plays] 
[Doorbell dings] 
Oh, hi. 
Can I help you? 
You're new. 
Oh, my God, 
you're so cute. 
- [Chuckles] 
- Uh, thank you. 
Uh, was somebody 
helping you? 
Will. 
Will was helping me. 
Well, 
they're out right now, 
but if there's something 
that I can help you with... 
Well, no, I mean, 
I was in before. I'm Lydia. 
Uh-huh. 
Uh-huh. 
So you're... 
coming back for more? 
Yeah. 
You know, I thought 
I would do, 
like, the entire loft. 
- Uh-huh. 
- Built-ins, a coffee table, 
Page 57/71
and maybe 
a dining-room table. 
There's just so much glass 
and it's cold and it's hard 
and it's icky and ugh. 
You don't need to know 
about that, 
but, yeah, but I just... 
I need a fresh start. 
- A lot of work. 
- You mean expensive? 
I don't give a shit. 
It's not my money. 
[Both laugh] 
My ex-husband 
did incredibly well, 
but hey, fuck it. 
My lawyer was better, 
and I wasn't fucking 
my secretary. 
Like, what kind 
of a guy does that? 
It's, like, what year 
were you living in? 
I mean, the whole thing 
is gross. 
I really should stop 
talking about him. 
- I'm sorry. 
- No, you can say whatever you want. [Sighs] 
You're very sweet. 
You're going, like, 
"Aah, it's a crazy lady! 
Someone adjust her meds." 
They have. They did. 
Meds have been adjusted. 
- Can't you tell? 
- Oh, no, I... I didn't think... But, you know what, I just think the whole thing is, um... 
I'm here because I think 
this place is really cool 
and what Will's doing 
Page 58/71
is so honest 
and he just shows that 
you can do whatever you want. 
I mean, 
you can start over again. 
You can start over again, 
and it's, you know. 
I know. 
Life is weird. 
It's fucking weird. 
That's true. 
Well, I will tell Will that 
you that you were... were here. Thank you. 
You're so... lovely. 
What's your name? 
Anna. 
Anna. 
Anna. 
Thank you. 
[Doorbell dings] 
- [Knocks on door softly] 
- Anna: 
Hey, Dr. Bennett. 
I just, um... 
I-I'm so sorry 
I didn't make it. 
I don't know 
what's going on with you, 
why you're slipping 
like this. 
You are on the verge of 
an amazing academic career, 
but it feels like 
you don't even want it. 
What do you want, Anna? 
Get it together. 
[Utensils clack] 
[Horn honks] 
- Hey. 
- Hi. 
You want to take a walk, 
get a coffee or something? 
Page 59/71
I've got a better idea. 
Come on. 
What? 
What are we doing? 
Breaking and entering. 
What? Are you... Are you kidding? What if we get... 
- Come on. 
- What if we get caught? 
Come on. 
Oh, geez! 
Look at that. 
Not bad, huh? 
Who... Wait, what is this? 
What does it look like? 
Uh... 
I don't know, 
some kind of gesture? 
No. 
It's just a piano.

- Play. 
- What?

No, you should definitely

Oh, I can't. 
Not here. Not at... No. 
Please play.

- Dane, um... 
I, um... 
- I-I can't stop thinking... 
- Dane. 
I-I'm an articulate person, 
so just... just let me... 
[Sighs] 
Ah! You're incredible. 
I love this, 
spending time with you, and... Hey, listen, I know 
it's new and that it... 
it scares you, and I don't 
want to rush it, 
- and I don't... 
- That's... That's what I-I want to... Will you go out with me? 
[Scoffs] 
What am I, 16? 
I... 
Please say something. 
Dane, it's... 
it's too much. 
Oh, no. 
Fuck. 
- No, please, please, please, please. - No, wait, stop. 
I take it back. 
I didn't say anything. 
We don't know each other. 
- I know how I make you feel. 
- No. 
Everything that... that you 
Page 61/71
think that you're feeling... 
Well, tell me... 
Tell me I'm wrong. 
Everything that 
you feel, it isn't real. 
- You don't know that, okay? 
- No, I do! 
It's not real. 
This isn't real! 
It's real to me. 
Just give it a chance. 
No. 
Why? 
Why? 
Because I don't feel 
the same way. 
Yes, you do. 
Clearly, you do. 
- How would you... 
- You're still standing here 
trying to convince me 
that you don't. 
I was fucking you, Dane! 
I was just fucking you. 
You're lying. 
Lying! 
You're here. 
Hi. 
Yeah, like clockwork, right? 
[Dogs barking] 
You okay? 
I don't know. 
Uh, actually, um... 
This might be dumb 
or whatever, but, uh... 
meeting you, 
it's helped me a lot. 
Good. 
I'm glad I could help. 
Good. 
Good. 
Hale, you, uh... 
Well, you know I'm not... 
Yeah, yeah. 
Page 62/71
No, that's not why I... 
- Oh, my God. 
- ...said anything. 
I'm sorry. 
It's ridiculous of me. 
- No, I can understand why... 
- No, I... No, no, no, that's tacky. I don't know why 
I made that assumption. 
No, no. Really. 
You just listen to me. 
Well, 
I'm glad I could help. 
[Sniffles] 
I don't know what to do. 
None of us do.

Yeah, I mean... 
No, it's... 
- Hi. 
- Hey. 
Where have you been? 
Um, Glenn, this is... 
Reece. 
- Hi. 
- Hello. 
I'm the boyfriend. 
I'm Glenn. 
Um... 
Well, I-I better get him 
home before he wakes up. 
Um... 
Nice meeting you. 
[Grunts] 
You, uh... 
You okay? 
- Yeah. 
- Okay, good. 
- Who was that? 
- It's a friend. 
- Oh, yeah? Friend? 
- He's a friend. 
A friend I don't know 
about? 
Page 63/71
He's just a friend. 
Is that what this is? 
Are you and Glenn... 
Is that why? Is that 
what the fuck is going on? 
In a way, yes. 
In a way, 
what the fuck does that mean? 
I want to be happy. 
Hale, years together. 
All I get is 
a, "I want to be happy"? 
- You don't listen. 
- Vagaries bullshit? 
- Are you leaving me for him? 
- No! 
No, whatever this is, 
this is the worst version 
of you. 
Do something else. 
Look, I'm sorry. 
I went t-today to the place. 
I went. 
I made an appointment 
for Thursday. 
I want us to do it. 
I want... 
I want to have a baby. 
No. 
What do you mean? 
You don't want 
to have a baby? 
Yes, 
I want to have a baby. 
But not with you. 
- Why not? 
- Because you don't want it. 
What the fuck difference 
does that make? 
- You never wanted one. 
- I want one now. 
This is not fair. 
You decided this. 
You made this decision 
Page 64/71
by yourself, 
and now I have 
no fucking say in it! 
I don't know what to do!

What? 
What are you doing here? 
Um... 
if you want us to do 
more work for you, 
that's... 
that's fine. 
That's great. 
Thank you. 
Um... that'll be 
the extent of it. 
- Sure. 
- Yeah. 
- That's fine. 
- Okay. 
I just wanted 
to, you know, face to face. 
Yeah. 
That's sweet. 
That's... 
[Sighs] 
That's very sweet. 
All right. 
You look great. 
Thanks. 
Well... 
Hey, uh... Anna, 
she's really beautiful. 
Yeah. 
Page 65/71
[Clears throat] 
Yeah. 
She's perfect. 
[Gong rings] 
Who was that? 
Did I say you could 
leave the room? 
Get back in there. 
You gonna punish me? 
Yeah, 
I'm gonna make you weep. 
I'm gonna crush you 
like a little grape. 
- All right. Yeah, all right. 
- Shh! No more talking. 
Anna, you are my whole life, 
you are my everything, 
and I want us 
to be together forever. 
Same again. 
Thank you. 
I'm excited I get to have 
a whole nother bottle. 
- Mm-hmm. 
- Okay. 
[Sighs] 
What? 
Hmm? 
Oh, nothing. 
I was just thinking 
about that trip. 
What trip? 
[Pops lips] 
[Chuckles] 
You know, the trip. 
You wanted to go 
on a trip. 
Oh, okay. 
Well, yeah, sure. 
But don't you want to wait 
until the house is finished? 
Yeah. Right. 
Right. Absolutely. 
No, totally. 
Page 66/71
We probably should. 
You know, um... 
Oops. 
Wrong pocket. 
[Imitates trumpet fanfare] 
- It's for you. 
- Wait, is that... 
- Mm-hmm. 
- Are you... 
- It's for you. 
- Seriously? 
Yes. 
You mean you finished 
the house? 
Mm-hmm. So now 
can we go on that trip? 
[Both laugh] 
No way! 
I don't believe it. 
[Laughs] 
Let's go. 
Come on. 
I want to see it. 
[Gasps] 
What is it? 
Open it. 
Open it. 
Gonna open it? 
All right. 
I'll open it. 
[Laughs] 
It's a ring. 
Yes. 
[Both chuckle] 
I don't want 
to be with anyone else. 
I know that now, okay? 
I... [Sighs] 
I don't know who I am 
without you, Anna, 
and you're my whole life. 
It's starts with you. 
Can't not be you. 
So [Chuckles] uh, 
Page 67/71
will you... 
[Scoffs] 
I should, you know... 
[Chuckles] 
Will you marry me? 
- Yes. Yes. 
- Yes? 
- Yes. 
- Good... Good answer. Good answer. Of course I'll marry you. 
I'll marry you. 
Just get up. 
[Laughs] 
I bet your mother 
wore it well. 
Well, now it's yours. 
Here it is! 
Hmm? 
Now wait. 
It gets better. 
You're gonna 
love this.

- What? 
- Why would... 
Why would... 
Why did we do this? 
So we could start 
a family? 
This is... 
Come on. 
You want to... 
You want to come 
and take a look? 
What's wrong? 
I can't. 
Page 68/71
Can't what, exactly? 
Come on, Anna, will you just 
please come inside? 
Please? 
Anna, I built this 
for you, for us, 
with my own hands, 
okay? 
I need you to look at it. 
Can you just look 
at it, please? 
If I go in, I'll stay. 
- Yes. 
- Forever. 
Yes, that is what 
a house is for. 
I just need to you come inside. I need you to come inside. 
Will you just get in 
the fucking house, please? 
Anna, I just proposed, 
and you said yes, okay? 
It's fine. 
It's gonna be fine. 
I love you. 
I love you. 
Good, okay. 
Let's do this. 
Come on. 
- Will. Will. 
- What? 
The house, it's... 
it's perfect, but, uh... 
I don't want it. 
Just because 
the house is done, 
it... it doesn't mean 
that we should get married, 
and it... it doesn't mean 
that... that we'll be happy. 
W-W-We'll be happy. 
We are happy. 
Right? 
Will, I know I've... 
Page 69/71
I'm ruining your... 
You've worked so hard 
and the house 
is beautiful, but... 
Will, we're just... 
we're just playing house. 
You don't want me. 
What's wrong with me? 
Hmm? 
Nothing. 
Anna, please. 
"I don't know 
who I am without you." 
That's what you said, 
right? 
Don't you want to know? 
God.
