[whistling "Danny Boy"] 
[door closes] 
[footsteps] 
ANNIE: 
like no other on Earth. 
A land full of wonder, 
mystery, 
and danger. 
Some say to survive it, 
you need to be 
as mad as a hatter, 
which luckily... 
I am. 
Bless me, Father, 
for I have sinned. 
MAN: 
MAN: 
supposed to smoke in here. 
ANNIE: 
again then. 
MAN: 
You know exactly what I want. 
I want your work, 
your contracts, all of it. 
MAN: 
you're out of luck. 
I've been recommended another 
interested party to handle my... [chuckles] 
liquidations. 
I'll make you a wager. 
These other interested parties, I'll set them on one another 
like starving rats in a cage, 
and you can 
watch through the bars. 
Give me a fortnight. 
I'll have them both dead 
Page 2/58
at your feet. 
If I win, I get your work. 
All of it. 
If you win, 
you get to make me the 
interested party that's dead. 
Deal? 
MAN: 
ANNIE: 
I need a little favor. 
I need you 
to find someone for me. 
[film noir] 
MAN: 
[knocking] 
Filet steaks and a robust red 
for supper, is it? 
Fuck off, you punk. 
Don't do that. 
It's dangerous. 
I've got an open blade here. 
Stick it in your mouth. 
Maybe it will keep you quiet. 
Why are you shaving? 
Two weeks we've been in here 
all day and all night, 
and suddenly 
you're putting your face on. 
What's all that about? 
I've got a date later. 
Have you? Bollocks. 
Only date you've got is with 
a camp bed and your right hand, you wanker. 
[whistling "Danny Boy"] 
[whistling continues] 
No trains till tomorrow now. 
404 going north, 
calling all stations 
until termination. 
Have a pleasant trip. 
Page 3/58
I'm not going north. 
I just need a train. 
Train? 
- Yes. 
- Where you going? 
Nowhere. 
I just need a train. 
- Why? 
- Never you mind! 
There's no need for rudeness. 
[coughing] 
I'm so sorry. 
That was, um... 
That was unnecessary. 
A man... 
who needs a train... 
but not the journey... 
is a man with a problem. 
Indeed. 
Are there any freight trains 
coming through here 
- between now and then? 
- Naw. 
No freight trains here. 
Of course. 
Yeah. 
404 going north, 
calling all stations 
until termination. 
Well, the 404 
seems like an age away, 
and it's not time 
I'm trying to kill. 
End of the Line Cafe 
situated on 
the station concourse, 
open 24 hours a day. 
Why not purchase one of 
our delicious sticky buns? 
Only 30 pence. 
You're peculiar. 
And you're staring 
at an empty platform 
in a deserted station 
Page 4/58
in the middle of the night, 
waiting for a train 
that isn't coming. 
Touch. 
End of the Line it is. 
[coughing] 
[sighing] 
[coughs] 
- [whistles] 
- [coughing continues] 
Give us your money, 
you old bastard, or I'll do you! What? No! Absolutely not! 
- You think I'm kidding? 
- I didn't say that. 
I just feel like 
you lack preparation is all. 
[gun cocks] 
How's this for preparation? 
Now give him your wallet 
and your watch. Now! 
I'll tell you what. 
I'll buy the gun off you. 
I've got a fiver here, 
a crisp five pound note. 
Take it or leave it. 
Raymond, hurry up! 
What do you want me 
to do, Lenny? 
- He's not cooperating. 
- Lenny? 
- You are? 
- Raymond. 
Raymond. Now listen to me 
very, very carefully. 
I've made what I believe to be a perfectly reasonable offer. 
Now you're going 
to make a few quid, 
and I'm in need of a gun. 
Now, is it loaded? 
What do you mean, 
is it loaded? 
I mean, are there 
Page 5/58
any bullets in it? 
Of course it's loaded! 
Really? 
No, it's not loaded. 
- Ah. 
- Ray! 
- For Christ's sakes! 
- What? 
It's not, is it? 
This is ridiculous. 
- Hey, where you going? 
- Stay there you or I'll... 
Or what? What, Lenny? 
You going to butter me 
to death? 
I'm very disappointed 
in both of you. 
You've let me down, 
and you've let yourselves down. Something to think about, 
isn't it? 
Good night. 
Fucking piss me off sometimes, you do. 
Why did you tell him 
there were no bullets for? 
[arguing continues] 
[clock ticking] 
You can't smoke in here. 
Well, there's 
no one else in here. 
They're not smoking either, 
are they? 
[coughs] Can I have another cup of coffee then? This one's cold. That's because you've been 
playing with it for 20 minutes. - Can I have another one? 
- Sure. 40 pence. 
Have a heart. 
I just got mugged. 
39 then. 
I'm in a giving mood. 
[coughing] 
Page 6/58
So shines a good deed 
in a naughty world. 
Naughty? 
As in spank me gently, 
I've been a naughty girl? 
No, not that kind of naughty. 
As in tie me to the bedposts 
because I've been so naughty? 
I think that qualifies 
as the same kind of naughty. 
I know. 
I just enjoy watching you fidget when I say "naughty." 
Have we met before? 
Why? Do I look familiar? 
[coughing] 
Are you all right? 
Do you need your medicine? 
Well, tell me which one. 
You've got to be kidding me. 
Medicinal purposes. 
Nice. Go on then. 
How about that coffee? 
[distant woman screams] 
Listen to this. 
"Curvaceous, 
cream-skinned belle 
seeks sleek Romeo 
for candlelit romance 
and walks in the moonlight. 
City based." 
See, that's code, that is. 
That's deviants' code. 
Pervert poetry. 
Translates to "Fat bird 
wants outside seeing-to 
late at night." See? 
Well, that is funny. 
"Slight, retiring 
young gentleman 
seeks decisive, practical lady to draw him from his shell. 
Friendship and romance. 
Suburban residence." 
Page 7/58
Translation: 
Skinny pencil-dick 
seeks dominatrix 
for abuse and humiliation. 
Has own dungeon. 
World's gone to shit, 
and all anyone can think about is their next dirty one 
down the docks. 
There it is, though. 
There it is 
in black and white. 
So... 
what's wrong with you? 
I beg your pardon? 
You're hardly the picture 
of health. What's wrong? 
You don't want to know. 
I'm fascinated. 
- Tell me. 
- What's wrong with you? 
I have an unquenchable bloodlust for darkness and depravity. 
That's nice. 
Is it cancer? 
No, no. 
[coughs] 
Has anyone ever introduced you to the concept of small talk? 
Well, what is it 
if it's not cancer? 
They don't know. 
No way. 
That is brilliant. 
You're a bit odd, aren't you? 
Unquestionably, but death 
is by far the best bit. 
- Of what? 
- Of life! 
Did you read that 
in a birthday card? 
You're funny. 
All right, 
Page 8/58
let's examine the facts. 
It's terminal, your sides hurt, and you cough badly. 
All signs point to 
malignant tumor damage. 
You're not in denial about it, are you? 
You're not desperately searching for another explanation? 
BILL: 
Yeah. 
No, thanks. 
But you don't know... 
why or how? 
No. 
Will it be painful? 
Oh, no. 
Well, how can you be sure? 
Painkillers. 
[bottle clattering] 
[telephone ringing] 
Is there anything else? 
[ringing continues] 
Lolly? 
It's definitely not cancer. 
Okay. I don't want to 
waste my time diagnosing you 
if it's going to be some 
run of the mill cancer thing. 
Who says I need diagnosing? 
You're dying. 
Painfully, apparently. 
And they don't know 
why or what of. 
It just sounds 
pretty undiagnosed to me. 
We're all dying, you realize. 
Slowly, painfully. 
Just a matter of time, friend. See now, that's the spirit! 
Are you scared? 
I try not to think about it. 
How's that working out 
Page 9/58
for you? 
Not very well. 
Are you being survived? 
I have no idea 
what that means. 
Wife, kids? 
Okay, you can't say that. 
It's "survived by." 
It has no other 
grammatical context. 
Jesus, what are you, 
a dying English teacher? 
Yeah. 
Oh. 
That's fair enough, I suppose. Conjugate me 
to your heart's content. 
- Conjugation's different... 
- Shut up. 
Okay. 
Are you sure 
we haven't met before? 
I don't know. Have we? 
One shouldn't answer a question with a question. 
One shouldn't be such 
a pompous prat, but here we are. [laughs, coughs] 
I think I would definitely 
remember you if we'd met before. You would think so, 
wouldn't you? 
[sirens blaring] 
[groans] 
What the fuck is going on? 
Who the hell are you? 
Untie me. 
Now! 
[exhales] 
Listen to me. 
You've made a mistake. 
A big one. 
But it is a redeemable error. 
You're gonna put on 
Page 10/58
the rest of your clothes, 
you're gonna 
gather your things, 
you're gonna give me the key, 
and then you're going 
to run for your life. 
You've no idea who I am, 
what I do, 
or who I work for. 
Au contraire, 
Mr. Nigel Illing. 
I know exactly who you are. 
I know exactly 
what it is you do. 
And I know exactly 
who you work for. 
I also know that you're 44, 
5'11", 12 stone, 
AB Negative, 
a drinker and a smoker, 
and you have a healthy appetite for young hookers 
in kinky suspenders. 
And when you combine 
the information 
I have gathered on you 
and your habits, 
one can deduce exactly 
how many drops of laudanum 
it requires to render you 
unconscious 
and relatively docile. 
I need a teeny-weeny bit 
of information from you 
and a small donation. 
Okay, what do you want? 
You want money? 
You want the car? 
Listen, you can take it. 
You can take it. 
Take whatever you want. 
Oh, that's a very poor 
choice of words. 
Help! Help! 
Page 11/58
Help! 
[muffled screaming] 
[rock] 
Bless me, Father, 
for I have sinned. 
So there's this guy, right? 
He's creeping 
through this house. 
It's dark, sinister, creepy. 
You get the picture. 
Pulls out his gun, 
and he goes into the room 
with it 
held arm's length 
in front of him, Vince. 
I don't know what to tell you. It's the pictures. 
Right. You walk 
into the room, right? 
In like a shot. 
You clear your corners. 
Cleared. 
The room is yours, easy. 
You don't fucking ease 
your gun into the room 
without being able 
to see anything, 
waiting to be shot. 
It's stupid. 
It's a film, Alf. 
It's make-believe. 
It's factually inaccurate. 
They actually make it up. 
It's not as though they've got some hit man consultant 
talking them through 
the finer points 
of assassinating 
other fictitious people. 
Yes, but why not? 
It would be factually accurate if they did. 
I just realized something. 
You're a fucking moron. 
Page 12/58
Two teas, love! 
Oy, bottle blonde! 
Two teas. 
What's the magic word? 
To be fair, 
you didn't say "please." 
Please, could we have 
two tea cups of lovely tea, 
a little bit of milk, 
two sugars, both builder's, 
please, if you don't mind? 
Thank you very much. 
It will be my pleasure. 
Wanker. 
Watch this. 
Excuse me. 
Could I have one of your... 
lovely-looking 
sticky buns, please? 
It's dinner and drinks 
at the very least 
before you get your hands 
on my buns, handsome. 
I mix a mean martini, 
sugarplum. 
In that case, 
I'll even butter them for you. Alfred, would you mind terribly rejoining me at the table, 
pretty please? 
Before I break 
your fucking neck. 
Duty calls. 
On the job, are you? 
Is there the remotest chance 
that you could possibly 
calm down a bit? 
And what kind of a shithole 
is this then, eh? 
You said somewhere quiet, 
off the beaten track. 
So you find the only 
late night cafe 
open this side 
Page 13/58
of the precinct. 
It's genius. 
I thought it might be nice 
if we had a cup of tea 
while we talked. 
Enjoy my buns. 
[laughs] 
Are you fucking drunk 
or something? 
ALFRED: 
VINCE: 
That's why. 
ALFRED: 
so cloak and dagger 
that you couldn't just 
tell me over the phone? 
A job's coming. 
Yeah? 
Guttering, is it? 
Window cleaning? 
Yeah, keep up the cheek, son. 
You know, you're gonna 
get clipped round the ear. 
In fact, 
you're gonna get a clip 
straight in 
the fucking forehead. 
Understand? 
All right. 
I'm listening. 
So there's a message 
on the answering service. 
VINCE: 
"Go to the terminal 
and open locker 125." 
- ALFRED: 
- VINCE: 
Page 14/58
ALFRED: 
"La Lapin Blanche." 
What's that? 
Well, it's French. 
Yes, I know, thank you. 
I simply don't understand 
the relevance of it. 
Are you going 
to ruin this for me? 
Are you going to suck 
all the fucking alluring mystery out of this fucking 
situation for me? 
So it's a clue. 
- A trail of breadcrumbs. 
- Yes, apparently. 
Someone has a pen-chaunt 
for the amateur dramatics. 
It's pronounced penchant. 
It's pronounced 
shut your fucking mouth 
is how it's pronounced. 
Hang on a second. 
Black briefcase. 
Mm-hmm. 
In a locker. 
A clue. 
A trail of breadcrumbs. 
Vince, that's the touch, mate. That is a job 
from Mr. Franklin. 
VINCE: 
This is massive! 
All right. 
Don't get moist. 
I thought 
he always used Illing. 
[slicing, screaming] 
Apparently not. 
Now, have I whet your appetite? I'm salivating. 
Let's go rabbit on him. 
We've got to play our cards 
Page 15/58
right on this one, Vincent. 
No one fucks 
with Mr. Franklin. 
It is a once in a blue moon, 
once in a fucking lifetime 
opportunity. 
It's keys to the kingdom. 
All right, Alfred, 
it's Mr. Franklin, 
not the fucking second coming. 
ALFRED: 
this is the place. 
VINCE: 
Was it the 20-foot neon sign 
with the fucking rabbit on it? [techno] 
Pinch me, I'm dreaming. 
VINCE: 
a good-priced cover. 
[continues] 
I made myself 
look good for you 
Dressed up real nice 
Oh, baby, 
this is all for you 
I'm like the perfect 
little wife 
Hello, handsome, 
dangerous men. 
Hello, beautiful, 
semi-clad girl. 
Business or pleasure? 
Is the real question 
do I want to pay you 
to writhe around on top of me 
for a couple of songs, 
get me hot all under the collar and take me into the back room for an overpriced hand job? 
'Cause if it is, 
the answer's no, fuck off. 
Page 16/58
You are no gentleman. 
But you, on the other hand... 
I'm Conejo. Welcome. 
What is it you seek? 
We're here to meet someone. 
- Who? 
- We don't know. 
About what? 
- We don't know. 
- Oy! 
You need to see Bunny. 
Follow me. 
So where's this Bunny then, eh? You'll see. 
Conejo. 
What a beautiful name. 
I bet it means "waterfall" 
or "sunset" 
or something exotic like that. It means "rabbit," tit. 
Oh, yeah. 
Get your head 
in the fucking game, mate. 
You're becoming 
a fucking liability. 
And part of my job is to 
dispose of fucking liabilities. What do you mean, 
I've become a fucking liability? 
EMCEE: 
[crowd cheering] 
- Shut up. 
- We all play the game. 
[cheering continues] 
Shut up. Look at her. 
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. 
Here we go again 
The ending's just the same 
Yeah? I'll show you game. 
Yeah, are you 
the famous Bunny? 
ANNIE: 
Page 17/58
Well, I'm not here 
for conversation or culture. 
I'm here for information. 
Maybe a filthy lap dance, 
if I can get one. 
Then you're in 
the right place, Vincent. 
How do you know my name? 
Bottle blonde! 
What the fucking hell 
are you doing here? 
Girl's got to eat. 
Is there somewhere 
we can go and talk? 
That depends. 
Have you got something for me? I was thinking more of 
an envelope stuffed with money. [whistles] 
Now, I bet that's gonna buy me a few filthy lap dances. 
Probably a lot more than that. Come and find out. 
Both of you, 
down the rabbit hole. 
Curiouser and curiouser. 
They're with me, boys. 
VINCE: 
we don't know why... 
to see you, apparently. 
You're supposed to 
give us something, 
though why you couldn't 
have given it to us 
at the pissin' cafe 
is way beyond me. 
Then we leave. 
Sound like a plan? 
So. 
So? 
Look, I'm just the middleman. 
Think of me as 
a half-naked waitress 
Page 18/58
delivering goods 
from one anonymous party 
to another anonymous party 
for a fee. 
Or slightly less anonymous 
in your case, Vincent. 
- What's the combination? 
- No idea. 
Well, what good's a briefcase 
if we ain't got the combination? No idea. 
Huh. Doesn't even need 
a combination. 
Thank you, Miss Bunny. 
We'll be on our way. 
Hang on. 
There's something different 
about you, bottle blonde. 
Besides my stocking suspenders, plunging cleavage, 
and full face 
of harlot's makeup? 
[laughs] 
Yeah, yeah, besides that. 
ALFRED: 
No. 
I want my lap dance first 
before I go anywhere. 
[gun cocks] 
I'm ready if you are. 
I'll let the dog 
see the rabbit. 
Let's go, Vince. 
Floor show's over. 
Let me show you chaps 
the quick way out, shall I? 
I'm gonna get that filthy lap 
dance off of you, bottle blonde, one way or another. 
Come back again soon, handsome. 
VINCE: 
I'll even show you my tail. 
Page 19/58
Don't bring him. 
Wow. 
Oh, Jesus Christ. 
One sniff of a whore's perfume, you think you're in love. 
I mean wow. 
[laughs] 
She looked better 
as a waitress. 
Wow! 
VINCE: 
you know that? 
[ding] 
It's the waiting 
that's doing me in. 
Just, um... 
sitting around, 
waiting to stop breathing. 
My mom went in a house fire. 
No waiting around there, 
I suppose. 
- I'm sorry. 
- No, you're not. 
You are utterly self-involved 
at the moment, 
completely wrapped up 
in yourself. 
Steady on. 
Just 'cause I'm on my way out 
doesn't mean I've turned 
into a complete bastard. 
Why not? 
It's your prerogative. 
That is your hard-won 
silver lining. 
I don't follow. 
Okay, well, think of it 
this way. 
It's moral carte blanche. 
It's an open invitation 
to anarchy. 
You can spend 
your last days on Earth 
Page 20/58
doing whatever you want. 
Rape away. 
Smite to your heart's content. Pillage the precinct 
till the gutters run red, 
and none of it will matter 
because you'll be dead 
by Sunday. 
So go nuts! 
You know, dry roasted, 
sniper in the clock tower nuts. Did something happen to you 
as a child? 
Besides my mother dying in agony in a blazing inferno? 
Oh, I am so sorry. 
That was... 
Don't apologize. 
Rub my nose in it. 
Come on, pillage me! 
Sorry. Was that a bit naughty? What happened to your thumb? 
Oh, that. 
An exercise in self-control. 
Ah. It went well then. 
[chuckles] 
Look, all I'm saying is 
this seems like 
a really good opportunity 
to do whatever 
the hell you want. 
Well, what if I want to 
mope around in all-night cafes, feeling sorry for myself? 
Then, frankly, 
I might as well do you in now 
and save myself from 
your self-indulgent tripe. 
[laughing, coughing] 
Well... 
Well, I would appreciate that. Annie. 
Bill. 
That's not your locker! 
Page 21/58
You're going to give me 
a fucking heart attack! 
It is a criminal offense 
to interfere with 
either municipal storage 
or precinct property. 
Any suspicious activity 
must be reported 
to the appropriate 
authorities immediately. 
Why don't you piss off, 
old man? 
Mind your own business. 
Supervisor. 
Night Supervisor. 
Duties to include sweeping 
of concourse and platform, 
maintenance 
and attendance of all... 
Shut up! 
Tell me something. 
Do I look to you like 
the sort of individual 
that creeps into the station 
in the dead of night, 
breaks open a locker, 
removes a suspicious-looking 
briefcase, 
and then lets 
the fucking cleaner... 
sorry, night supervisor... 
run off and tell tall tales 
about it? 
Do I not strike you 
more as the sort of 
highly motivated, 
highly vicious individual 
that would not kill 
said night supervisor 
and stuff him 
into the fucking locker? 
Acceptable forms of payment 
at the terminal are as follows: cash, banker's drafts, 
Page 22/58
certified checks up to the 
value of the return journey. 
[laughing] 
I like you. You're funny. 
All right, all right, 
I'll clear it. 
- Oh. 
- Mum's the word, Supe. 
- Okay. 
- [laughs] 
- Oh! 
- Ten, twenty, thirty. 
We all right, son? 
When rich villains 
have need of poor ones, 
poor ones make 
what price they will. 
Come again? 
I want more money. 
Yeah. 
- Oh, yeah. 
- [laughs] 
You know, when rich villains 
get pissed off 
with poor ones 
overcharging them, 
they go round their house, 
they burn it, 
they murder their family. 
Terminal Train Lines 
thanks you for your business 
and wishes you 
a pleasant evening. 
What a fucking crook! 
[whistle] 
- Yo, you better give me your... - Fuck off! 
I just wanted to know 
the time, mate. 
My bad. 
Yeah, that's it, 
fucking walk on. 
Yeah, yeah, you better run. 
Dickhead. 
Page 23/58
[laughing] 
- Just for you. 
- Thanks. 
[door slams] 
VINCE: 
Hello, Prince Charming. 
- Alfred. 
- Vince. 
You want to put her down, mate. You don't know where she's been. You'll catch something. 
Duty calls. 
Well, it was lovely 
seeing you again, handsome. 
Can't say the same 
for you, Vincent. 
You want to get your head 
in the game, mate? 
You're getting sloppy. 
I'll see you around, 
bottle blonde, 
if I don't shoot you first. 
Ooh. 
Vince! 
Bang. 
Wanker. 
[machines beeping] 
This was in the briefcase. 
Press play. 
I'm gonna stretch my legs. 
I am Mr. Franklin. 
I have no doubt 
you know who I am 
and what my business is worth. I have an offer, a contract. 
I want you 
to kill someone for me. 
You will lie in wait 
in the apartment 
I have provided for you. 
You will be on call 
24 hours a day, 
seven days a week, 
Page 24/58

until I contact you to... 
execute. 
Jesus. 
Before you commence, 
I require one of you to 
attend a face-to-face meeting. Only one. 
I do not like crowds. 
That is all. 
Fucking perfect. 
Evening, bottle blonde. 
Out for a casual stroll? 
[Annie whistles] 
Well, for fuck's sake. 
You know what? 
I'm getting a little bit old 
for all these parlor games, 
bottle blonde. 
Evening, gorgeous. 
These are for you. 
You're in trouble, Alfred. 
I'm always in trouble, 
sugarplum. 
Spare me the heroics. 
You're in real trouble. 
Targeted, 
shot in the back of the head 
unless you pay attention 
trouble. 
I'm listening. 
Good, because I like you. 
You're handsome, 
and you're chivalrous, 
and I like your jaw. 
It's manly. 
I want to keep you. 
- Well, I think you're... 
- Shut up. 
Understood. 
There's someone here to see you. Listen to what he's got to say or that handsome face of yours will have a gaping exit wound 
slap bang in the middle of it. Page 25/58

- Okay. 
- Good. 
Come on out. 
He's not gonna bite. 
[door slides closed] 
Hello? 
[ringing] 
[ring] 
MR. FRANKLIN: 
Good evening, Vincent. 
Mr. fucking Franklin, 
I presume. 
- The very same. 
- Let me get this straight. 
You drag me out 
in the middle of the night, 
halfway across the city, 
freezing cold, 
up 20 flights of rickety stairs just so that you can speak to me on the fucking phone? 
Who says mystery's a lost art? Yeah, fair enough. 
Now, the contract. 
You and your partner 
start tomorrow. 
The target will be 
lured to this window. 
It faces the apartment 
where you will be waiting. 
One shot to the head. 
A clean kill. No mistakes. 
Now, I have another deal, 
a side part, for you. 
VINCE: 
MR. FRANKLIN: 
executed the contract, 
I want you 
to kill your partner. 
Why? 
I don't like crowds. 
Page 26/58
And I like loyalty I can buy. 
Double the original offer, 
in cash. 
What you want, 
his head on a silver platter? 
His ID papers and 
trigger finger will suffice. 
I'm offering you double 
the money and a one way split. I believe I can trust 
your mercenary greed. 
Now, do we have a deal? 
Yeah. 
Consider it done. 
MR. FRANKLIN: 
Where'd you get ahold 
of that there thing? 
Where the fuck 
did you get that? 
Stop it, Alfred. 
He's just the messenger. 
Who is about to get very shot 
on the count of three. 
One, two... 
Locker! 
Locker in the terminal! 
Black briefcase. 
Note inside. 
A man... 
A man paid me. 
An envelope with money. 
Please don't kill me! 
- Three. 
- [gun clicks] 
Now fuck off. 
Go on. 
Fuck! 
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! 
Fucker! 
[sighs] 
Feel better? 
[groans] 
It's all bullshit, isn't it? 
Page 27/58
No job, no hit. 
Oh, no, handsome. 
There most definitely was a hit. Me? 
Not anymore. 
We can find a new target. 
We? 
Now tell me something, 
sugarplum. 
Why should I trust you, eh? 
Aren't you part of 
this whole conspiracy? 
I told you. 
I like you. 
I need someone 
to butter my buns for. 
Well, I suppose I do need 
a new partner now, don't I? 
My old one seems to have 
become rather untrustworthy. 
But I will warn you, Alfred. 
I'll need a firm hand and a 
regular lash of the tongue. 
I can't wait 
to have you under me. 
Good. 
Let's have a cup of tea 
and plot our bloody revenge. 
You tidy that up. 
I'll put the kettle on... 
partner. 
The way I see it, 
you've got two options. 
Go on. 
Option A: 
I see. And B? 
Well, you've got to hear 
the case for Option A first. 
- I do? 
- You do. 
I'm all ears. 
- You're dying. 
- Apparently. 
Page 28/58
- You're not happy about it. 
- Not really. 
You're miserable, touchy. 
Quite frankly, 
not great company. 
Oh, thank you. 
Want my advice? 
No. 
Just end it. 
Have you ever considered 
counseling? 
Every minute of every day, 
you're bombarded with 
a series of hazardous 
and potentially life-ending 
situations to choose from. 
Jump in front of a bus. 
Have a bath with your toaster. Fall on your butter knife. 
Tall buildings, 
rivers, bridges, trains. 
There are more ways 
to end your life 
than there are ways to live it. All this pissing around 
in train stations 
in the middle of the night 
would be over. 
End this nothing, 
and all it takes is some balls. And my immortal soul? 
Overrated. 
Overrated? 
Have you done something to put your immortal soul in jeopardy? Well, there you go then. 
Nothing to worry about. 
Are you Catholic? 
Yeah. 
[coughing] 
Religious? 
[coughing] 
Oh, fuck me. 
Oh, sorry. Um... 
Page 29/58
Forgive me, Father, 
for I have sinned. 
To be honest, I can't recall 
the last time I took confession. I think it's more than 10, 
but less than 20. 
Days? 
Months? 
Not years, surely. 
Don't get pissed off at me 
for telling you the truth. 
That's just mean. 
If I'd known you were like this, I would've just said three days and taken my chances 
with the Almighty. 
[coughs] 
Sorry. 
That was uncalled for. 
I apologize. 
Are you still there? 
[sniffing] 
I know you're there. 
I can smell sherry. 
[flicks lighter] 
Define religious. 
Lolly? 
I'll take that 
as a big fat no. 
Maybe it's divine retribution. Oh, yeah, that sounds tasty. 
You know, 
my sins revisiting me 
and my past 
coming back to haunt me... 
I'm all ears, William. 
Let me hear your confession. 
Repent and thou shalt be saved! That's not even from the Bible. Okay, that is the graffiti 
that's written on the bus stop opposite the terminal. 
That's disappointing. 
That's pretty much my entire 
Page 30/58
knowledge of scripture. 
Try this one: 
Repent, turn back, 
and thy sins 
will be blotted out. 
Not really as catchy, is it? 
[laughs] 
How's my case 
for suicide progressing? 
Am I quaking your foundations? You're giving me a headache. 
Oh, how's this for a headache? Take a pencil, 
jam into tabletop, 
slam head down onto pencil, 
dead in five seconds. 
- That's foul. 
- Isn't it? 
And every time 
I suggest this to someone, 
they think it goes 
up your nose. 
You've suggested this 
more than once? 
It can't go up your nose. 
That's impossible. 
Think about 
the trajectory involved. 
It would go in your eyeball, 
right? 
Through the socket, 
into your brain. 
I... Well, it depends on the 
angle of the head, I suppose. 
Let's test the theory. 
It's not very sharp, is it? 
Use your fancy pen then. 
It's heavier. 
Nib's sharper than yours. 
Probably get it further into 
the table, better purchase. 
It would feel more proper, 
wouldn't it? 
Page 31/58
More ceremonial. 
A pen does have more purpose 
than a pencil. 
More stature. 
Definitely a better choice. 
Definitely, 
and how resonantly poetic. 
The English professor found 
impaled on his own fountain pen. It's epic. 
It's inspired. 
We've cracked it! 
Time, place, method, 
it's all there. 
Don't you think 
it'd be a bit painful? 
You're missing the point. 
Hmm? 
Get it? 
- Brilliant. 
- God, you're not very keen. 
Do you want to 
kill yourself or not? 
I'm not so sure now. 
Oh, pathetic. 
Can I have that pen then? 
I never had one like that. 
- No. 
- Why? 
Because it's mine. 
Thought you were 
about to top yourself? 
What do you need a pen for? 
Come on, please. It'll be 
like you left it for me. 
- Bequeathed it, not left. 
- Oh, my God. 
Shut up! 
I'm taking the pen. 
You've got no use for it, 
and I want it. 
Here, you can have my pencil 
to make up for your loss, okay? Done, swapped, over. 
Page 32/58
[rock] 
ALFRED: 
we been stuck in here? 
VINCE: 
and 27 minutes. Why? 
ALFRED: 
VINCE: 
your bottle blonde? 
Geez, you're like 
a hormonal teenager. 
She's gonna be the death of you, that fucking girl. 
- Cards. 
- Yeah? 
- Great. Hold 'em. 
- Three-card brag. 
Fuck off. 
That's a pouf's game. 
Fine. Hold 'em it is. 
Fair enough. Let's go! 
That's more like it. 
Oh, give 'em here. 
You're gonna fucking 
hurt yourself. Come on. 
Just give 'em to me. 
For fuck's sake, Alf. 
There's fucking 
barely half a deck. 
We could always play snap. 
I'll snap your fucking neck 
in a minute! 
How do you play solitaire? 
Quietly, on your own, 
in the other fucking room. 
- You really are becoming a... - Yeah, a fucking liability. 
I know. Hear it all the time. 
Boss, look at this. 
What is it? 
Something for me 
Page 33/58

to beat you to death with? 
No. 
"The time has come, 
the walrus said, 
to talk of many things. 
Of shoes 
and ships and sealing wax, 
of cabbages and kings." 
"And why the sea is boiling hot and whether pigs have wings." 
I don't get it. 
It's gibberish. 
It's all like this, 
the whole bloody book. 
It's just fucking drivel. 
Well, I'm sure Lewis Carroll 
will be suitably apologetic 
when he finds out 
how upset you are. 
Why don't you fuck off 
into the other room 
and leave me alone, eh? 
[rock] 
[ice crushing] 
Want a drink? 
A proper drink, I mean. 
Oh, no doubt. 
Bill, it's time 
we explore Option B. 
Oh, goody, there's more. 
There is. 
Option B: 
[coughing] 
I believe they call that 
"euthanasia." 
Eutha-what? 
It was very popular at one time with the Swiss. 
What's a Swiss? 
[laughs] 
Doesn't matter. 
All I'm saying is, 
if you haven't got the peanuts Page 34/58

to do it yourself, 
just get someone 
to do it for you. 
Are you saying I take 
a contract out on myself? 
Exactly. 
Do they have an assassins 
section in the classifieds? 
"Wanted: 
anonymous stranger. 
Must have own rifle." 
My new boyfriend's 
a contract killer. 
[laughs] 
And, talk about 
getting lucky, 
he's getting off 
a job today. 
Serendipity, indeed. 
We could give him 
a brief, you know, 
suggest a few ways 
you wouldn't mind being killed, let him pick the best one. 
Try this on for size. 
You're just going about your 
daily business, then one day, 
you're on your way home from 
a long day in the classroom... Shot in the head. 
Last thing 
you would've expected. 
I think it's safe to say 
if I'd paid somebody to kill me, I'd be expecting to be killed 
most of the time. 
You just have to, you know, 
try not to think about it. 
- Oh, okay, I'll do that then. - Right. 
Can we bank long distance 
head shots then? 
Quick, anonymous, painless. 
Page 35/58
- Sounds like a keeper. 
- Great. 
Let's brainstorm 
a few more ways to die. 
Let's! 
- Stabbing? 
- No, I don't like knives. 
It sounds very, 
sort of messy and painful. 
That's the sort of thing 
he's gonna need to know. 
- Who? 
- Our possibly fictitious, 
but possibly real hit man, 
who happens to be 
my new boyfriend. 
Oh, okay. 
Ooh, what about a hit and run? - [tires screeching] 
- [screams] 
Oh, now, I have a problem 
with that. 
- Go on. 
- What if I just get mangled? 
He'd have to reverse 
back over me. 
That's just horrifying. 
Hmm. 
- Pushing? 
- I don't follow. 
Off a tall building, 
for the sake of argument, 
or in front of a train. 
I must say I have explored 
the idea of trains somewhat. 
Hey! 
[screams] 
Short, sticky, and sweet. 
Before you know it, 
you're strawberry jam 
and dental fillings. 
You really can 
paint a picture, Annie. 
Only downside's the whole 
Page 36/58

closed casket thing. 
Granted, but I am starting 
to like the idea of falling. 
It sounds almost accidental. 
Can we bank it, pushing? 
Yeah, let's have it. 
To imminent death. 
To the 404. 
[clinks] 
[crash] 
What's up? 
What? 
Is there anything 
you want to say? 
No. 
I'm seriously fucking bored. 
You want to play a game? 
Do I look like I play 
Snakes and Ladders to you? 
Well, you did do that jigsaw. 
I fucking hate puzzles. 
You did do that crossword book. - You trying to be funny? 
- What about chess? 
- Are you trying to be funny? 
- No, Boss. 
So I don't have to come over and teach you some fucking manners. - No, Boss. 
- Because if I do 
you're gonna fucking regret it, you understand me? 
Yes, Boss. 
Good. 
Don't fancy Monopoly then? 
God, keep it up. 
I'm going to put you six feet 
under the fucking ground, mate. Are you? 
You know, I don't know 
why I bother on you. 
I should just shoot you 
in the face, 
get myself another apprentice. Page 37/58

I thought I was 
a junior partner. 
Oh, that's just the flash way 
of saying "apprentice." 
I'm a valuable asset. 
You're a fucking liability. 
I already told you what I do 
with fucking liabilities. 
If it wasn't for me, 
who'd make the tea, 
collect the cash, 
sort the jobs? 
You know, do the fucking work! Good lad. 
Now you're getting it. 
[tuning radio] 
[ballad] 
Oh, cracking. 
Pathetic fallacy. 
Whinging librarian. 
Excuse me? 
No, that's what that's called, when emotional turmoil 
is reflected 
in tangible surroundings. 
Like two lovers go their 
separate ways in a rainstorm, 
or lightning strikes 
as the murderer's revealed. 
It adds gravitas. 
It would hardly be 
as nerve-wracking 
if the serial killer 
stabbed his victim to death 
in a sunny park, would it? 
Much better in a dark alley 
in a mist. 
My God, you are wasted 
as a teacher. 
You should be published. 
You should be preaching. 
You should be inciting 
bloody revolution. 
And yet here I am, 
Page 38/58
a lamenting English teacher 
coughing his spleen 
out through his nose, 
wishing the earth 
would swallow him whole. 
[ballad continues] 
Come with me. 
Really? 
Bill! 
Oh! 
BILL: 
ANNIE: 
and pathetic fallacy. 
Chop, chop! 
Well, this seems 
like a great idea. 
Come on, Bill. 
Where's your sense of adventure? Warm and dry 
and congealing with my coffee. What the hell is that? 
It's an old ventilation shaft 
from when the city actually 
used to work properly. 
It's condemned now. 
Just a hole 
dropping into nowhere. 
Down and down and down. 
[echoing] 
Well, that's just about the most terrifying thing I've ever seen. You come here often, do you? 
Oh, yes, I love it here. 
- Here, come stand on the edge. - No, I... 
ANNIE: 
Feels amazing. 
Annie, come on back. 
Oh, my God! 
[Annie laughs] 
Well? 
Page 39/58

Well, what? 
You said you wanted the earth 
to swallow you whole 
not five minutes ago. 
There you go. 
You're welcome. 
You want me to jump in there? 
Pathetic fallacy. 
- No, it's not. 
- Yes, it is. 
Emotional turmoil reflected 
in tangible surroundings. 
I'm in a deep, dark hole. 
It's perfect. 
Let's test your gravitas. 
- Or gravity, more like. 
- Exactly! 
Look, I'm not gonna throw 
myself into a yawning chasm 
just because it fits neatly 
into a metaphor! 
Why not? 
Quick, clean, painless. 
Poetically resonant. 
You are insane, certifiably. 
Unquestionably. 
You get close to the edge, 
and then I can push you... 
Time out! Time out, okay? 
Okay, fine, fine. 
[gasping] 
[screams] 
What the fuck was that? 
Are you out of 
your fucking mind? 
What is the worst that 
could've happened, Bill? 
You'd be dead. 
It would all be over. 
No more pain, 
no more suffering. 
No more waiting for a train 
that isn't coming. 
What if I had just let you fall? Page 40/58

None of this would be happening. This conversation, 
your smoldering anger, 
your eloquent 
bloody resentment. 
Nothing. 
Not like that. 
I do not want to go like that. Like what, Bill? 
Trains, cars, gunshots, 
it's all the same end product. I think the question 
really is, 
do you want to go at all? 
Standing on the edge really 
makes you think, doesn't it? 
RAYMOND: 
I'll shoot you in the face. 
I wish you bloody would, 
but you won't. 
ANNIE: 
Stop reasoning. 
Just close your eyes. 
Take a last breath 
and just walk. 
[percussive] 
VINCE: 
ALFRED: 
It's like 
a fucking apocalypse. 
[gun cocks] 
VINCE: 
What? 
I said there's no one around. 
Yeah, it's dead. 
Like a corpse. 
Was that loaded? 
[click] 
Yeah. 
Page 41/58
You're dead. 
Milk, two sugars. 
ANNIE: 
[breathing heavily] 
That's it. 
No. No, I can't. 
[gasps] 
How disappointing. 
Disappointing? 
[Bill coughing] 
Disappointing? 
[coughs] 
This is all a fucking game 
to you, isn't it? 
Get this through 
your little skull, okay? 
I am dying. 
I am... 
I am going to die! 
To me, all this is real! 
The fucking hole 
in the ground is real! 
I'm not standing on the edge. 
I am already falling down! 
What are you, like, 23, 24? 
Young, fit as a fiddle, 
immortal? 
All your death nonsense 
is exactly that. 
A load of fucking nonsense! 
Step into the light more, 
enjoy nice things. 
Stop skulking around 
big holes in the ground 
and wasting your life 
in all-night cafes. 
Enough with the facade, 
this idle fucking fantasy! 
Go on, Bill. Go on, rage. 
Rage against the dying 
of the fucking light! 
Did all this death stuff 
start when mommy died? 
Page 42/58
Ah, yeah. 
What was it, 
an absent father? 
A concerned priest, perhaps? 
Did you find it was easier 
to get attention 
if you were the freak, 
the weirdo, 
the angel-faced kid 
with a heart of darkness? 
I bet you were a cutter, 
weren't you? 
I bet you loved 
a good razor blade. 
Somewhere obvious where 
everyone could see the scars. 
Did you have a little friend, 
a little accomplice? 
Somebody you could go off 
behind the bike shed with 
and burn each other 
with cigarettes? 
Another little orphan helper 
built in your own image, 
the two of you 
egging each other on? 
Fuck! It's textbook, Annie! 
Textbook! 
You're two a penny! 
I have taught dozens of you 
over the years. 
I have known silly little girls like you all my life! 
Naughty, naughty little girls 
just like you! 
[coughing] 
Naughty. 
I just enjoy watching 
you fidget when I say... 
Naughty. 
Gotcha. 
Oh, God! 
Have we met before? 
You remember now. 
Page 43/58
Don't you, 
Mr. Braithwaite? 
I think I would definitely 
remember you if we'd met before. You would thing so, 
wouldn't you? 
You remember this 
naughty little girl? 
You remember punishing me, 
Mr. B? 
Silly, naughty little girls, 
enough! 
Maybe it's divine retribution. You know, my sins revisiting me. I'm sorry. 
After lights out, 
our little secret. 
Did something happen to you 
as a child? 
I've waited all night 
for you to remember me. 
All fucking night, 
not two feet away, 
just waiting for you 
to connect the dots. 
Do you wanna know why 
you don't have the balls 
to kill yourself, 
Mr. Braithwaite? 
Because you know exactly where you're going when you die. 
[shudders] 
Orphans always make the best 
victims, don't they, William? 
But chalk-stained fingers 
leave indelible marks 
on little girls' panties. 
Consider this 
divine retribution. 
Burn in hell. 
Was that gun loaded, 
the one you pointed at me? 
VINCE: 
Page 44/58

either way. 
[phone ringing] 
- What's that? 
- It's the fucking phone. 
All right. 
[ringing continues] 
Yes? 
Okay. 
Got it. 
That was Mr. fucking Franklin. It's on. 
- [phone ringing] 
- [snaps fingers] 
Yeah. 
[ringing continues] 
Yes? 
ALFRED: 
Is this phone in range? 
VINCE: 
Where's the fucking target? 
ALFRED: 
taking a shot? 
There is no shot. 
Take the shot, Vince. 
What's the problem? 
Shut up! 
Bottle blonde! 
Fuck hell's she doing here? 
Gotcha. 
Put the gun down, Boss. 
What the fucking hell's 
going on? 
This is what we call 
in the trade "a double-cross." Now put the gun down. 
And now sit at the table, 
hands where I can see them. 
You all right, bottle blonde? 
Took your time, sweetheart. 
Thought you actually were 
gonna let him have a pop at me. Page 45/58

Oh, I think he's been trying 
that quite enough recently. 
Stop it, Alfred. 
Don't be naughty. 
Sorry, sugarplum. 
Now get yourself over here. 
Come and savor 
this moment with me. 
[hangs up phone] 
I see you finally lost 
your virginity then. 
Congratulations. 
Hi, handsome. 
You smell different. 
My new perfume. 
It's intoxicating. 
Oh, Jesus Christ, kill me now. With pleasure. 
Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
Tell me something. 
What have I ever 
done to you, eh? 
Vincent Escariot. 
Tut, tut, tut. 
You'd sell your own partner 
down the river 
for 30 pieces of silver. 
I like loyalty I can buy. 
You traitor, you. 
What the fuck's it got 
to do with you? 
Now, now, Vince, 
don't be rude. 
I think you've been 
quite rude enough 
to my other half recently. 
Your girlfriend's doing all 
your thinking now, is she? 
Well, fuck you... 
and your fucking whore. 
Don't you misunderstand 
the situation you're in 
for one second, Vincent. 
You'll keep a civil tongue 
Page 46/58
in your head, 
or it won't be quick and easy. It'll be slow and messy. 
You are a fucking 
pain in my ass! 
As well as being 
a double-crossing, 
backstabbing, 
turncoat traitor. 
But guess what. 
I've got a new partner now, 
Vincent. 
And unlike with you, 
I just love it 
when she fucks me. 
This is your doing, 
isn't it, bottle blonde? 
Oh, yes, Vincent. 
I'm the master villain. 
VINCE: 
The pair of you, 
you're both mad, delusional. 
Fuck you 
and your fucking whore! 
You don't have to let him 
talk to us like that, handsome. No. 
Your eyes. I saw them... 
Bye, Vince. 
[Alfred laughs] 
- That was fun. 
- It was brilliant. 
Right. I need a shower 
and a change of clothes, 
and then I'm taking you 
out to dinner. 
My treat. 
Our first proper date. 
Bye-bye, sugarplum. 
Bye, handsome. 
[knocking] 
Ah! Cleaning service. 
I'll have the works, 
Page 47/58

please, mate. 
The full spit and polish. 
Here's a cherry on top. 
Call it an apologetic token 
for the little overreaction 
the other night, eh? 
See you later, Supe. 
Ohh... 
Hi, handsome. 
Hello, sugarplum. 
Did you get 
your homework done? 
- Top of the class. 
- Smart girl! 
I've got a little 
surprise for you. 
Are you wearing that stripper 
getup under that red coat? 
Stockings, suspenders? 
You know, you really do 
have such a lovely jaw. 
Wait right here. 
Yeah. 
Hello? 
Sugarplum. 
Sugarplum. 
[click] 
I really hate that nickname. 
Drop the gun, 
hands up where I can see them. One wrong move, handsome, 
you'll have that gaping 
exit wound in your face 
we talked about. 
Drop it. 
Kick it away. 
Good boy. 
I thought we were partners. 
I've already got a partner. 
Cripple? 
[laughs] 
So all of this was, what? 
An overelaborate scheme 
perpetrated mercilessly upon you Page 48/58

by highly motivated, highly 
intelligent individuals... 
With a penchant 
for amateur dramatics. 
It's pronounced penchant. 
You are correct, Alfred. 
Two weeks you had me 
in that fucking apartment, 
waiting to kill someone 
who was waiting to kill me. 
- Why? 
- Because we like to have 
all our dollies 
lined up on the shelf. 
Shit! 
ANNIE: 
locked in a cage, 
tearing each other apart 
just for our pleasure. 
And... you never 
really liked me? 
Me? No. 
Has anyone ever told you 
that you are a two-faced, 
treacherous, manipulative, 
callous little bitch? 
Oh, you have no idea. 
[laughs] 
Annie, darling, I don't 
suppose you'd consider... 
No. 
Look, I know 
you wanted to keep him, 
but we got bigger 
fish to fry, okay? 
I've got the ID papers. 
Give me his gun. 
[yelps] 
Stand and deliver! 
Oh, Christ! 
You nearly gave me 
a heart attack. 
You're early. 
Page 49/58
Give me that gun. 
Where'd you put Vincent? 
What you gonna do 
with them both? 
Can we chuck them 
in the river? 
No. 
I've got a better idea. 
Give me a hand. 
[grunts] 
Ah, for a fool such as this. 
I shall think nothing 
of tumbling downstairs. 
Curiouser and curiouser. 
See you around, Supe. 
Oh, good day. 
[whistling "Danny Boy"] 
[ringing] 
[ring] 
[ring] 
Yes? 
It's done, Mr. Franklin. 
- Yes? 
- Both of them. 
Good. 
And the little favor, 
the teacher? 
I'm forever in your debt. 
Did you have fun, sweetie? 
It was like jelly and ice cream. The cripple was very useful. 
End of the Line cafe. 
- He's just the messenger. 
- Mum's the word. 
- All right, son? 
- Cleaning service. 
He has his uses. 
Are you suitably impressed, 
Mr. Franklin? 
Most definitely. 
Good. 
So I can rely 
on your business then? 
I have a limited 
Page 50/58
range of choice. 
You've suppressed 
the competition admirably. 
How do I know you're not 
going to double-cross me? 
You seem very adept at it. 
MR. FRANKLIN: 
How, indeed. But remember, 
I like loyalty I can buy, 
and you are unique. 
You're one of a kind. 
You have proved 
your value to me. 
So is this the start of 
a beautiful relationship then? Most definitely. 
- Good night. 
- Good night. 
[whistling "Danny Boy"] 
Excellent. 
What do you want? 
There are two things in life 
for which we are never 
truly prepared. 
Twins. 
Well, well, well, he lives. 
I'm sorry, Mr. Franklin, 
is the light bothering you? 
Where am I? 
You like what we've 
done with the place? 
[straining] 
A woman's touch 
is what was needed. 
How... How the fuck did you... Look through the looking glass, Mr. Franklin. 
Or shall we call you... 
Clinton? 
A rose by any other name. 
You've tumbled down 
the rabbit hole 
far beyond hope 
Page 51/58
or rhyme or reason, 
flushed away 
in a river of tears. 
You're mad! 
Stark raving mad! 
Oh, we can't help that, 
said the cat. 
We're all mad here. 
I'm mad. You're mad. 
Have you ever read it? 
It's our favorite book. 
Tweedledum and Tweedledee. 
Mommy used to read it to us 
every night. 
We know it front to back, 
cover to cover. 
Inside and out. 
If you gave us 
a page and a line, 
we could give you the words, 
verbatim. 
We hear tell it's hereditary. 
Like eye color. 
Or homicidal impulse. 
Blood will out. 
May we tell you a story, 
Mr. Franklin? 
Are you sitting comfortably? 
- Then let us begin. 
- Then let us begin. 
A long time ago in a place 
not dissimilar to this, 
as a point of fact, 
identical to this, 
there lived a young woman 
called Chloe Merriweather. 
Now, Chloe Merriweather 
had a gleam in her eye. 
She wanted adventure. 
One night in the aptly named 
Anything Goes, 
Chloe Merriweather 
succumbed to the wiles 
of one Clinton Sharp, 
Page 52/58
a low-level criminal 
with aspirations of grandeur, 
who whispered sweet nothings 
in her ear 
and kept her drink topped up 
and his powder dry. 
Theirs was a knee-trembling 
relationship. 
Then for a time, very little 
was heard of Chloe Merriweather until a year or so later 
she reappeared. 
She'd grown up, 
like all little girls do. 
She waited tables by day, 
and she danced on them 
by night. 
For Chloe had a secret 
that nobody knew 
buried deep within 
her heart of hearts. 
She had two little girls 
at home. 
Twins. 
The result of her passionate 
tryst with Mr. Sharp. 
- Daddy. 
- Daddy. 
But Chloe Merriweather knew 
better than to involve Clinton in her daughters' lives, 
for she had seen 
the shadow in his soul, 
the murder in his eyes. 
She kept them hidden 
from the world 
and from Clinton Sharp. 
Deliciously sweet 
were those times. 
But life is cruel, 
and the world is small, 
and fate laughs mercilessly 
at us all. 
One deep, dark night, 
Page 53/58
Chloe Merriweather saw something she ought not to have seen. 
[men arguing] 
Clinton Sharp working. 
Chloe Merriweather 
ran for her life 
through that deep, dark night. But it wasn't long 
before Clinton Sharp 
came calling for Chloe 
with a canister of petrol 
and his cigarette lighter. 
Rumor has it 
he whistled while he worked. 
[whistling "Danny Boy"] 
But Chloe Merriweather 
was a fighter, 
a wildcat with fierce tears, 
unwilling to go gently 
into that good night. 
Chloe saved her little girls, 
but the wildcat could not 
get herself to safety. 
[Chloe screaming] 
And so it was we found ourselves wards of the precinct, 
taken into the mercy 
and kindness 
of St. Catherine's Orphanage. 
To the welcoming arms of 
the priests and the teachers 
with their wandering hands 
and their sticky fingers. 
Here we learned how to close 
our eyes and bite our lips. 
We learned how to go elsewhere in our hearts and our heads 
when the lights went out. 
As soon as our legs 
would carry us, 
we ran far, far away. 
Survival was 
all we hoped for. 
A feral existence. 
Page 54/58
Until one day, 
who should we see 
shuffling by with his cart 
and his broom and his limp, 
but Clinton Sharp. 
[whistling "Danny Boy"] 
In all his crippled glory. 
That selfsame whistle 
that had haunted 
our nightmares for so long. 
So we hunted you, Daddy, 
and before long, we discovered your clever little secret. 
Mr. Franklin, 
a master villain marionette. 
The legendary black briefcases, the infamous voice messages, 
the lost art of mystery. 
What's in it? 
VINCE: 
locker number. 
ALFRED: 
Mr. Franklin, don't you? 
Who says mystery's a lost art? 
MR. FRANKLIN: 
mystery's a lost art? 
And we let you track us, Daddy, as we tracked you. 
Inch by inch, 
we laid our plans against you. We baited our traps 
and cast our lures. 
We pulled the strings 
that made you dance. 
We knew exactly 
what would get your attention 
and that you couldn't resist 
hearing our confession. 
I need a teeny, weeny donation, Mr. Nigel Illing. 
Mr. Franklin, I must confess, 
Page 55/58
I've been a naughty girl. 
Meet me at 
St. Catherine's Church. 
MR. FRANKLIN: 
a well-conceived venue. 
I want your work, 
your contracts, all of it. 
I'm afraid you're out of luck. I've been recommended 
another interested party 
to take care of my problems. 
I'm better. 
I highly doubt it. 
You men, with your bad suits 
and your pumiced hair, 
you're utterly predictable. 
I reckon to the point 
of carelessness. 
Yes. 
Me? 
I'm the switchblade 
in the garters, 
the stiletto in the stilettos. I'm the surprise 
they never see coming. 
Who says mystery's a lost art? Who'd have thought? 
We're Daddy's little girls, 
after all. 
And now we stand on 
the brink of our vengeance, 
on the cusp 
of the wildest of justice. 
You are my daughters, yeah? 
In blood only, Daddy. 
Don't get too attached. 
Mommy has to be avenged. 
Tell us, Daddy, are you familiar with the science of lobotomy? 
Much maligned 
in this day and age, 
but somehow rather 
fitting in this scenario, 
Page 56/58
don't you think? 
Please, girls. 
Anything. 
I'll do anything. 
But not this, please! 
Not this. 
I beseech you 
in your mother's name! 
I am your father! 
No, no, no. 
Far too little, far too late. 
- [screams] 
- Shh, Daddy, easy. 
I've got you. 
Try not to fight. 
The time has come, 
the walrus said, 
to speak of many things, 
like shoes and ships 
and sealing wax, 
cabbages and kings. 
[screaming] 
An eye for an eye, Daddy. 
[screaming] 
The coup de grce 
is yours, dear sister. 
The nail in the coffin. 
Send Mr. Franklin 
to Wonderland. 
Night-night, Daddy. 
- Perfect. 
- Perfect. 
Follow me 
Follow me 
I'll show you how 
How to run 
this deadly town 
And get mad 
Put that money, money, 
money in the bag 
Put that money, money, 
money in my hands 
And get running, running, 
running out fast 
Page 57/58
And get running, 
running, running 
'Cause I'm a silent 
I'm a silent killer 
And I'm coming 
Yeah, I'm coming for you 
So be frightened 
Yeah, be frightened of me 
'Cause I'm coming 
Yeah, I'm coming for you 
I'm a silent killer 
[whistling "Danny Boy"] 
The Queen of Hearts 
She knows your sin 
She breathes it out 
She breathes it in 
The Queen of Hearts 
She sees your soul 
Upon your breath 
The alcohol 
The Queen of Hearts 
She'll bleed you dry 
But when you're cleansed 
The crown will cry
