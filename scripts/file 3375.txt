Move! Move!
Get out of the way!
Move!
Stay with me, Rose, all right?
Stay with me.
Come on. Hey, hey, hey,
look, look at me!
ROSE (V.O.):
When it all falls apart...
you can surrender on sight.
Locked it.
ROSE (V.O.):
You can run for the exits...
or you can fight back...
to your last breath...
until there's nothing left.
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
(MUSIC FADES DOWN)
L.A.P.D. Metro. Third one today.
Hey, Mark.
How are you, doll?
Good to see your face
around here.
Mm-hm.
You comin' back to work soon?
Yeah, any day. Actually, I'm...
- Hey!
- Hey.
If it isn't Old Glory Corley.
All right, man. Oh, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Give me a hug. Give me a hug.
How are you doin'?
Good, man. He all right?
Come on.
Good to see ya.
You look worse than I imagined.
What the hell you imaginin'
me for?
Sorry to drag you down here,
man.
No one else gives a shit, right?
Well, at least he's got you.
Poor bastard.
There he is...
restin' comfortably.
You son of a bitch.
Lock him up.
- You're serious?
- Mm-hm.
You let him out, I'll kill him
myself, lock him up.
This is his third offense,
Mark.
I process him, he's in for a lot
more than an over-nighter.
All right.
Look, I know it's been tough on
both of you since Rose passed.
Yeah.
I talked to the other guy.
He's not gonna press charges.
This is the last time I can help
you out, man.
Well, I appreciate it.
All right, that's what
partners do.
It's nice to see you out
and about, Mark...
get that fresh air and shit.
Just get in the fuckin' truck,
smart ass.
Do you even wanna hear my side?
Why? This ends with you in jail,
don't it?
You wanna piss your life away,
son, that's on you.
At least have the balls to own
it, for once.
Okay.
(ENGINE TURNING OVER)
I'll get the jumpers.
It's not the battery.
Jeez.
Can we call a cab?
You got money for that?
How much was that whiskey?
Change.
Change.
Change.
Here you go.
V.A. don't give a fuck.
Nobody does, brother.
Change.
WOMAN (OVER SPEAKER):
Next stop, Fifth and Flower.
Next stop, Fifth and Flower.
You are so much smarter
than this.
Christ knows you didn't
get that from me.
But this whole, "Fuck the
world," routine...
it's just not workin' for ya.
Some people got it comin'.
That's your words, not mine.
My words, wise ass, my words
don't put me in lock-up.
He said some shit, it deserved
an answer, all right...
so I... I hit him once.
One time? You broke his jaw
with one punch?
It fuckin' connected.
Nice.
I don't know what I'm gonna
do with you.
(LOUD CRASH)
Change.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Everyone all right?
What the hell was that?
- 87 westbound, can you hear me?
- (KNOCKS SOFTLY)
This is 87 westbound, can you
hear me?
Yes, how can I help you, sir?
Hey, Audrey, what seems
to be the problem?
Uh, power outage... the radio's
down.
It takes a few minutes to get
the system back up.
Okay, well, even without the
power the radio should work.
I know that, but it doesn't.
This is 87 westbound,
can you hear me?
I'm not tryin' to step on your
toes here, Audrey...
it's just I don't like tight
spaces....
so if there's anything
I can do...
You'll be the first to know.
Thanks.
Okay.
This is eight...
(LOUD CRASH)
What the hell was that?
- You okay?
- Yeah.
- Shut this door.
- Everybody please stay calm.
No one is leaving the train.
- Officer, please.
- I got two kids at home.
I wanna get home too, okay?
But this is procedure to keep
you all safe.
Please sit. Sit.
This is 87 westbound.
Can you hear me?
MAN (OVER RADIO):
Don't look to the lights.
Just don't look!
87 westbound, can you hear me?
Over.
MAN (OVER RADIO):
Don't look at the lights.
Light, what light?
(LOUD CRASH)
Fuck procedure. Move! Move!
Here, here.
Okay. Okay.
Everyone all right?
Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Bring 'em out.
- Make a single file to the right.
To the right.
Don't run. Just follow the
person in front of you...
and please stay calm.
Listen to what she's tellin'
you. All right. Okay.
Please, stay to the right.
To the right. Slow, slow,
slow, slow, slow.
Okay. Okay.
Come on, follow me.
Please stay to the right.
Come on, Trent.
Come on.
(RUMBLING)
- What the hell is that, huh?
- Shh!
Move!
Yeah.
Keep moving! Keep moving,
please.
Watch these rails.
Jones. Where the fuck
is everybody?
I don't know.
Where you all goin'?
Hold up.
Hey!
Trent! Hey!
What the...?
Whoa, hold up!
Come on.
Stay behind me, all right?
Hey, hold on one second.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I gotta get to my kids.
You don't even know
what that is.
Hey. Hey, hey! Excuse me.
Hey. What are you doin'?
Stop. Excuse me.
Hey, what the...
Mark! Mark! Mark!
Mark. Oh my God, the light.
Mark! Don't look at the light!
This is what they were tryin'
to warn us about!
Trent! Put your head down!
Trent!
Trent! Trent!
Trent, don't look up!
Damn it! Trent!
Mark!
Holy shit!
[AUDREY] Mark, are you okay?
Up! Up! Up!
What the hell is going
on up there?
Trent, you gotta breathe.
Trent, breath!
Hey! Hey, hey!
Go, go, go, go, go!
Move! Move!
Go, go, go! Go, go, go,
go, go, go, go!
We're under attack.
What the hell you think
that was, man...
terrorists or what, huh?
ISIS doesn't have no fuckin'
spaceship!
Look at me, son.
- What was that?
- Look at me, son. Look at me.
- I have no idea.
- You must have seen something.
I can't explain it. There was a
light shot out of a cannon.
A cannon?
It took everyone. Trent! Come
on, son. Breathe.
- I need to see his eyes.
- Trent? Come on, son. Breathe.
- Come on, good boy, breathe.
- Okay. He's lucid. Get him up.
- All right. On three.
- It's okay. Come on.
One, two, three.
We can't go back to the train.
We gotta get to the station
house. Get up, there.
- You got him?
- Come on. I got him.
Shh!
Whoa, whoa!
Garcia?
Son of a bitch!
So, I come outta the crapper and
the whole station's cleared out.
Okay, not just empty, more like
everyone just vanished.
And this blue light came in the
street. That's when we saw it.
Oh my God, this is really
happening.
Full scale. Christ.
Give me that gun.
You got clips?
Yeah.
All right. We keep movin'.
Let's go.
No, you're not hearin' me,
brother.
There's nowhere else to go.
We move or we die. Let's go.
Now.
Tracks only go as far
as Koreatown!
You wanna stay here, fine.
We move.
Guys, can you put your dicks
away?
They're building a new extension
on this line.
Tunnel goes all the way
to the west side.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
It's safe?
I don't know, but I think it's
worth a shot.
All right. We make our way to
the water, we find the military.
Find the Marines, somethin'.
We just keep movin'. Let's go.
- Guess we're movin'.
- Let's do it.
C'mon. Everybody stay close.
Hey, you need help, old man?
Give me your hand.
I'm... I'm Sarge.
Nice to meet you, Sarge.
I'm Trent. Come on.
Fuckin' aliens, man.
Are we almost there?
Been walkin' all night.
Hold on. We're at a service
shack.
You're gonna step up... there's
a step here, all right.
- I'm going to go in front of you.
- Watch it.
You got it. Ooh! That's it.
- You see this?
- Yeah.
- Here we go.
- Check it out.
What do you see up there, man?
Check that radio.
Ten-nine-nine. This is L.A.P.D.
Aw, shit.
Ten-nine-nine. This is L.A.P.D.,
acknowledge.
Ten-nine-nine. This is L.A.P.D.,
acknowledge.
Planes! They're ours.
They're ours.
MAN (OVER RADIO):
Acknowledging.
Requesting extraction. Three
officers, four civilians.
MAN (OVER RADIO):
Negative extraction.
Proceed to marina, Basin H.
- Where's that? Where's the basin?
- Come again on that.
MAN (OVER RADIO): Clear the city
as fast as you can!
They're goin' after that ship.
Move! Move down!
Go. Go! Move!
Go, go, go, move!
Move out of the way!
Move, move! Run, run!
I got you! Agh!
(SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING)
Sarge? You all right?
Shit.
Everybody okay? Jones?
Yeah.
Shit. They're dead.
They fuckin' nuked L.A.
Blast like that got to be
tactical.
Short range, low yield.
You can tell that just
from listenin'?
Otherwise we'd all be dead.
Only one way out.
Come on.
Hey! Don't look!
Trent! Trent! God damn it!
God damn it. God damn.
(ALIEN SHRIEKING)
- You okay?
- Yeah.
- You sure?
- Fine. Yeah.
[GARCIA] Get me outta here!
All right! All right!
You gotta be kiddin' me.
All right, come on.
Shit.
Are you all right?
I'm okay. I could breathe in
there and everything.
Maybe it wanted you alive.
Move! Move!
It ripped her fuckin' brain out!
We gotta go!
There's a car. We're goin' up,
okay?
Sarge, climb on the wheel.
Sarge, come on!
Go! Go!

Move! Go! Move!
That's it. You got it!
Come on, you two!
Come on.

Motherfucker! Agh!
Go! Move! Move!
Mark!
Go!
Holy shit. You killed it.
Yeah, everything fuckin' burns.
Amen to that.
(DISTANT RUMBLING)
Oh, shit. What the...
Move.
- Oh my God.
- What the fuck is that?
You don't wanna know.
Move!
- Run!
- Move!
Come on. Come on!
Hey, follow me! Come on, this
way. Come on! Hurry up!
Look, find an opening! Look!
There's one.
Come on, come on, through here.
From the pipe we can go in
and we can go back and...
No! We're not goin' back
in the tunnels.
Guys! He's losing a lot
of blood.
- We're goin' back in.
- I'm okay.
Move! Move, move, move, move.
- Move!
- I can't!
No, come on! Come on!
- End of the line, Old Glory.
- What?
I'll buy you some time.
Get your kid outta here. Go!
- Come on!
- Garcia.
- You can do it! Come on.
- Go!
That's it.
Hola, puta.
Oh, shit!
L.A.P.D. inbound
Boat Basin H.
L.A.P.D. inbound
Boat Basin H. Over.
L.A.P.D. inbound
Boat Basin H. Over.
This is a dead end.
MAN (OVER RADIO): Copy L.A.P.D.
Hold your position. Over.
Hey! What's that?
Move. Move!
We gotta run.
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)
Come on. Hey!
Come on, come on, come on,
come on.
Come on.
[MARK] Trent.
- Trent!
- Trent!
No!
Oh! No!
Come and get me, motherfucker!
You bitches ain't leavin' me.
Trent. Trent.
Hey... Trent.
- Huh?
- Hey.
Agh!
- Trent!
- Mark!
No!
Mark.
Get down! Ah!
Trent!
Mark! Mark! No!
Trent! I got you.
No!
Son-of-a-bitch.
Oh, fuck.
Oh, god, I need a drink.
(RETCHES)
Oh, fuck.
Hey! Wait!
(DISTANT MOANING)
Hey, Audrey. Come...
Hey. Hey.
Hey, wake up. Audrey.
Oh my God. Where are we?
I have no idea. Do you have
a light?
Please tell me you have a light.
Yeah. There was a flare
in my back pocket.
- Fuck.
- I can't...
Fuck.
I can't move my arms.
Right.
Other back pocket, slick.
- Sorry.
- Don't look at me like that.
Sorry.
What is... what is this place?
Hey. Hey. Wait!
Stop! Stop!
My son. I have to find my son.
He's in here somewhere.
He's alive. He's alive.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no.
No, no. Okay. Wait.
Oh, you mother...!
Please! Help me!
My water broke. I think
I'm in labor.
Okay, okay, okay.
All right, you're okay.
You're okay.
Look at me, look at me.
Breathe, look, calm...
- I can't do this.
- Yes, you can!
- No.
- Yes, you can.
- I'm not ready.
- Look at me. Look at me.
Just breathe and relax.
Breathe. I'm a cop.
- No, you don't understand.
- I'm a cop.
No, I... I've done this. Breathe!
I... I'm not due for another
six months.
After we saw the light...
I could feel the baby growing
inside me.
But Jarrod was different.
Each time, he-he grew stronger,
like he became immune.
Elaine, no! Stop!
Jarrod? No!
But they still ripped him apart.
They take our minds.
They use them to drive these...
machines.
And the babies, they take them,
too.
They tried to take mine,
but he saved us.
Somehow... he came back.
J... Jarrod?
- Holy shit.
- Oh. Oh, God.
- It's coming.
- Okay, okay, okay, breathe.
Look, look, look, stay with me!
Stay with me, stay with me.
Look in my eyes. What's your
name?
- Elaine. Elaine.
- Elaine, okay.
I'm Mark. I'm Mark. Okay? We're
gonna do this together.
Okay, breathe, breathe, breathe.
Almost got it. Now!
Be careful... Jesus! I got you.
I got you.
We gotta swing. Toward that
ledge, okay? Come on.
Come on. Let's do it.
This is what we're gonna go.
I'm gonna count to three and
you're gonna push, okay? Yeah?
One, two, three. Push! Push!
Reach! Come on!
Come on. You can do it. Reach!
Good girl, good girl. One more
time. Big push.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
One, two, three, push!
Come on. Just reach it.
Come on! Reach!
- Got it!
- Good.
Good girl! Okay. Okay. Okay.
Good girl.
(BABY CRYING)
It's a little girl.
It's a... it's...
it's a little girl.
Reach, come on!
When I catch it, you gotta
let me go, okay?
Wait, no! Why?
Yeah, it's the only way.
Come on.
All right.
Now!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Shh-shh.
This is yours.
Okay. I'm gonna make you a deal.
You help me find my son and I
promise you on my life...
I'll get your daughter
off this ship, okay?
Okay, good. Good. Good idea!
Okay. Your turn.
(BABY CRIES OUT)
Shh. Shh. Shh-shh.
Hey, you're gonna get us killed,
kid.
Jesus Christ.
What the...
What? You want me to put
my arm in there?
Jesus.
Ah.
Ah!
Things are lookin' up, kid.
Are we gonna blow the ship?
Do you think that's a good idea?
Okay. Let's just take it slow,
okay?
Help! Anybody there?
- Sarge, is that you?
- Sarge?
I thought I heard friendlies
up there.
Sarge, wait! Hold up!
Take your time, kid. This bitch
ain't got nothin' on Hanoi.
I know this. I've seen this.
That's their cannon.
[MARK] Where's my son?
You find him?
Oh, shit.
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)
(BABY CRYING)
Compared to Vietcong, we'll be
in the tiger cage.
Shh. Hey, you're okay, you're
a tough kid. Shh.
Mark! Mark! Up here!
[MARK] Trent.
The stubborn son of a bitch.
Hey! Hey, boy! You can save the
happy reunion for later.
[SARGE] You better get me
down quick!
[TRENT] Hang in there, Sarge.
We got you!
You stay put, kid. Okay.
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)
Come on.
Oh, shit.
Sarge, hang on!
Hey! That don't sound good!
- What are you doing?
- He's not gonna make it.
- Trent. Trent, come on!
- He's not gonna make it.
- Hey!
- [SARGE] Hurry that shit up!
Don't you do it!
Trent!
I'm gonna get you outta here,
Sarge.
If you ask me, you ain't got to
be no fuckin' hero!
Swing! Swing!
Come on. Come on!
Hey, boy! Get-get my ass
out of here!
Don't let go!
Sarge, grab the ledge!
I got it! I'm on it!
Trent, look out!
Oh, fuck! Ah!
Hold on!
Audrey!
Trent!
- Dad!
- Look at me! Stay with me!
- Dad!
- [AUDREY] Trent!
Save her.
Ah! No! No!
Mark!
Mark! Mark...!
Agh!
Audrey!
[MARK] The baby!
Holy shit.
Oh my God!
Come on. You fuckin' thing.
Sarge! The baby!
Hey!
Bring it on, bitch!
Mark!
Back! Get back!
(DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES)
Hold on!
Come on!
Wait! Get back!
(ALIEN SHRIEKING)
Kenya, come on!
Are you okay?
Yeah. The baby?
Yeah.
She's grown. Mark,
where did you find her?
I'll explain.
Not the kid.
Sarge.
What if we deserved this?
Shit.
I've more than earned it,
but not the kid.
Mark, we have to go.
I'm so sorry, Mark.
Sarge?
Help me up.
River. Thirty feet down.
You got to be kiddin'.
Nope.
You know I'm blind, right?
Yeah. You're the lucky one.
There's a narrow ledge, okay?
So lift your foot.
Wait for me. Okay, you got it.
Shit.
Okay, ready?
Let's go.
Mark!
Kanya!
Kanya! Kanya!
Hey.
Take the baby. Take the baby.
Okay. It's okay.
C'mon, big man. That's okay.
Come on. Come on. I got you.
Okay. All right, I got you, man.
You made it, brother. You made
it, brother.
- No.
- What...
No, no.
No, no, no! No, no, no, no.
- Please, please.
- Okay, he's hurt. He's hurt.
- Please.
- All right?
Please. Help.
Do exactly as I say. Or we leave
you here. Move.
Yeah. Okay.
It's okay.
Hey? Excuse me?
The baby needs dry clothes.
Hurry up.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I'm gonna change her.
- Okay.
Shh-shh-shh. It's okay.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Let her go.
All right. All right. All right.
All right.
Police. I should have fuckin'
guessed.
Golden Triangle. I already knew.
We're good.
Okay, what the hell does that
mean?
Nothing. Now just get the baby,
just get...
Look out!
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)
Mother fucker.
C'mon, you little boy.
Come on. Come on.
- Come on.
- Come on.
Come on.
Mark! Mark.
Sua! Shh. Shh.
The baby.
Who are they? Warlords? Militia?
Worse... police.
Since the aliens came,
they've been on the warpath.
They take everything...
the women, too.
We need to get out
of this valley.
Look, I'll help you.
You... you get that baby to
a doctor, yeah?
Fuck.
Oy!
Minefield. No shortcuts in Lao.
She needs to rest.
We camp here.
When I was up on that ship,
I only saw one real alien.
All the rest were just slaves.
Bullshit.
You love your brother, right?
No matter what?
No matter what.
Well, these things are still
human up here.
Our family, our friends,
our brothers.
If one of 'em can be freed,
they all can be freed.
It's not bullshit.
What was her name?
I... I'm so sorry. Sorry.
No. How's the kid?
Uh, she-she's still growing,
Mark.
Yeah, I know.
I mean, what, you think
they can help?
You got a better plan,
let me know.
Right, okay.
Rose... my wife's name was Rose.
That's a classic.
She was.
Shh.
(GASPS)
What?
I don't know what you're sayin'.
I don't know what you're sayin'.
I don't know what...
Hey! Hey, hey, no, it's okay.
He's down. He's wounded.
He can't-he can't hurt you.
We'll take him with us,
so please, please...
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
It's okay, okay?
Okay, come here.
It's beautiful.
Wat Shiva.
A thousand years ago, we built
this to honor the gods.
Now, we use it to fight them.
Jesus Christ.
I hope they have room service.
Fuckin' Temple of Doom.
Harper.
- Mark.
- Nice to meet you.
What is this place?
Home.
How's it up there?
Not good.
Yeah, it's pretty fucked, right?
She's got an extremely high
temperature.
What is she, three-years-old?
Try two days.
Yeah. They don't cover this
at med school, huh?
Actually, love, I'm a scientist.
Lemme guess, a chemist by trade.
Well, it pays better than
the CDC.
Plus, you really can't beat
the benefits.
We need to talk.
Tell me about the girl.
What you see in there,
that's what I know, that's it.
You think I care you're police?
You think that matters now?
Some shit matters. You hear me?
Some shit still matters, like
who I can trust.
I can't trust that guy.
Drug runners aren't real high
on my list.
As soon as Americans stop
buying... we stop making.
Well, I guess the apocalypse
wasn't a total loss...
then, was it?
Apocalypse. Yeah, that's funny.
Look around. When do you think
this place was built?
40 years ago you bombed us.
You tried to destroy us.
But we survived the American
apocalypse.
We'll survive this one, too.
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
I've got a present for you.
I've never seen anything
quite like this.
Mm-hm.
Something changed her DNA.
Change how?
I don't know if she's human.
Fuck me.
Hey, hey. Hey!
- She's not welcome here!
- Kanya! Hey, Kanya!
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Stop, stop. Stop!
- Enough! Enough! Enough!
- No, no, stop!
Enough, enough!
- Alien!
- No alien!
- No!
- Enough!
Listen to me. When I was on that
ship, I saw them...
doing experiments on our unborn
children, dissecting them.
Unborn babies.
When women see that light,
something happens.
The babies grow fast, most
of them die. She lived.
This child can be the key
to freeing the others.
Do you understand me?
Hope. She's our hope!
Now, I've got good news and bad.
Her cell walls are denser,
almost like a shielding.
Her blood is... nothing short
of extraordinary.
Yeah, right. Okay, good.
What's the bad news?
She's running out.
The constant growth has just
depleted her entire system...
and she's shutting down,
she needs a transfusion.
Oka... okay, but she's...
she's not human.
How can we match her blood type?
I'm not gonna lie.
Odds are we can't.
Hey! What about me?
I was weaponized.
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)
How ya doin' there, kiddo?
Hey.
Well, I'll be damned.
Yeah.
So, this is actually a bullet...
and this blue shit is what fuels
their light weapons...
mind control, all of it.
Can you make a vaccine?
Well, it's not actually a virus.
It behaves like bacteria,
a virus...
a sentient being, the whole
gamut.
Scientifically speaking, it's,
uh... completely bloody alien.
Except... it's biologically
compatible with our DNA.
Do you realize how
unlikely that is?
They've been here before.
I'll go one further.
They might have put us here...
planted us like a crop.
And every couple of millennia,
they come back to harvest.
Huh. You sure he's not doin'
the drugs?
But... they weren't counting
on one thing.
Evolution.
Her serum blocks it.
So, we load one of their bullets
with her blood...
into the right delivery system,
we can free them all.
We need to use one of their
cannons.
You are not fuckin' around.
Wow. Okay.
Huh?
Are you compensating
for something?
Too big?
Kanya, go rig the hillside.
Take her with you.
Okay.
'Kay.
This is all we'll have
for the next 24 hours.
We leave at nightfall.
Fights. Guns. Bombs.
Yeah, you're really good
for my health.
Hey, thanks.
(DISTANT ALIEN SHRIEKS)
Stay here.
Kanya. I said...
Kanya, come in.
Kanya?
Fuck! Agh!
Kanya!
Duck!
Kanya!
What? What's wrong? What?
The minefield!
Oh my God.
Oh!
(SPEAKING LAOTIAN)
Run, baby, run. Run. Run!
Whoa, wait, what is she doing?
Run!
What?
No, No, Kanya, please. Please.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Oh, shit.
Hey, you okay?
All right, all right, all right,
all right.
Oh my God.
Okay, breathe. You're good.
Hey, we gotta leave.
No. We defend these tunnels
every day.
Don't move. Hey!
How much time can you give me?
Not a lot.
I need that syringe. I'm goin'
after the cannon.
You'll never make it.
They're still human inside.
No! They're death. It's us
or them.
One of them is my son.
Yeah, it's crazy. I need the
syringe.
Fuckin' Americans.
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)
I'm gonna get you to
someplace safe, huh?
Make sure nothin' happens to
you, because I made a promise.
Yeah. You know what that means?
That means that no matter
what happens...
I'm not gonna let anything
hurt you.
Promise?
Yeah, kid. I promise.
Mark, you are not going out
there alone.
There's no time for this.
We don't have time.
Come on. We need to talk
about this now.
Listen, we both know this
is a one-way trip.
- Please! Please!
- You are all she has left.
You're the parent, Mark. Not me.
Come on.
I'm so sorry your family
is gone...
but killing yourself is not
gonna change that.
I gotta go.
Be ready.
Ready.
(DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES)
They're in.
Hold.
Hold.
Now!
Move back. Move back!
(ALIEN SHRIEKING)
(STEPS APPROACHING)
Give it to me.
Come on.
Agh!
Oh fuck!
(ALIEN SHRIEKING)
All right.
Take it. Take it. Come on.
Harper.
Apologies, love.
I'm, uh, I'm not a warrior.
I'm, uh, I'm a survivor.
I used to think that was enough.
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)
(SPEAKING LAOTIAN)
Keep your eyes closed.
(SPEAKING LAOTIAN)
Run, run, run. Come on.
Come on.
(LOUD STEPS APPROACHING)
Trent? Trent! Trent, don't!
(ALL SCREAMING)
Audrey!
Agh! Agh!
Oh!
Dad...!
Dad!
Dad! Agh!
(MUFFLED YELLING)
(DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES)
[AUDREY] Agh!
(DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES)
(LOUD STEPS APPROACHING)
- Oh, shit.
- Oh my God.
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey!
It's Trent.
Take it, all you.
Here, here, here!
Fight, Trent! Fight!
No!
(SPEAKING LAOTIAN)
Fuckin' aliens.
Ya! Ya!
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)
Get outta the way, kid!
Look out!
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)
(MUSIC CHANGES)
Hey.
Hey.
(GIGGLING)
I told you we would survive.
Survive? We did a hell of a lot
more than survive, my friend.
We evolved.
We have a name for this
little one?
How about... Rose?
Yeah. Rose.
ROSE (V.O.):
And that's my name.
Classic, huh?
Captain on deck!
At ease, guys.
That was the day we found
their weakness.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Trent.
I was a little busy.
ROSE (V.O.):
And our strength.
How about next time I drive...
you get stabbed.
ROSE (V.O.): Now, we're not
just fighting back.
We're taking the fight to them.
Ready?
Promise?
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
(MUSIC CONTINUES)
Whoa!
Fuck.
(LAUGHING)
What are you doin' here?
Just... acting and shit.
I gotta take a piss.
It ain't funny.
I'm an arm or two shorter, bro.
We're all rockin' American
Bring it on...!
(LAUGHING)
Yeah, I can see.
Let's get together after this.
- All right.
- Thank you.
I'll see you on the next
project.
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Okay. You, too.
You guys are...
You're the stupidest fuckin'
monster...
I've ever seen in my life.
Fuck off.
I'm just sayin'. You're gonna
blow us up.
