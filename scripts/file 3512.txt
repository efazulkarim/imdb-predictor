You're trying to steal 
my orange juice.

You're trying to steal

[police on radio] Robbery and shooting at South Figueroa. Robbery suspect down. [Du] I didn't do this. 
[cop] Put that gun down. Now! 
- [cop] Now!

That girl was there a minute 
and she was gone the next. 
But I didn't fire the gun. 
- [cop] What did you do then? 
- I... I... 
I shook the gun. 
She says she shook the gun? 
I'm gonna put her in hell.

[man on TV] The security 
Page 2/44
camera caught the dispute. 
Store owner Soon Ja Du thought 15 year old Latasha Harlins 
was going to steal 
some orange juice. 
Du produced a handgun and shot Harlins in the back of the head. A jury convicted Du 
of voluntary manslaughter. 
Her pre-sentence report recommended the maximum, 16 years. 
But Judge Joyce Karlin 
imposed probation, 
a $500 fine. No jail time. 
She got away with murder. 
How could you have peace 
when this is going on? 
Wake up, Los Angeles! Wake up! City of the angels 
Spread your wings for me 
I've been other places 
Looking for my dream 
Eastern cities 
Move too fast 
Southern ones too slow 
I can't go back to my past 
And I need someplace 
To grow 
City of the angels 
Clear your cloudy skies 
For me 
I heard you got some places 
That I ought to see 
Heard you got a Disneyland 
Not too far away

In your spaces please 
It's where I want to be

[Nicole] Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! 
- Breaking my hand. Lawsuit. 
- Listen. If you have to be... 
[both arguing] 
[woman] Listen to me. 
If you hadn't been 
suspended already, 
this would give me good enough 
reason to expel you for good. 
- Okay. Yeah. 
- You willfully defied 
- the legal authority of our school personnel. - Yeah. I got it. 
Did you see that asshole 
right there 
- grab me by the throat... 
- [school lady] Calm down 
[Nicole] Calm down? 
What do you want me to do? 
I can sell avocados, bananas 
and pineapples. 
- Excuse me students, move aside. 
- Off the corner of 3rd and Broadway. - You need to calm down.

Skin's wrong. I accept you. 
Please. I want you to call the counselor. Page 5/44
She can help you, Nicole. 
[cop car siren] 
Here comes the LAPD. 
Boom, boom, boom, boom, 
boom, boom! 
Hey, you looking for some 
kicking on ass? 
[crowd cheering] 
You need to watch your mouth, 
Nicole, and lower the volume. 
You are disrupting 
the entire school. 
We saw what they did 
to that Rodney King. 
You saw his face 
after he got beat? 
- Go home. 
- It wasn't very pretty, Miss Baum. - No, it wasn't. Go home. 
- Wasn't very pretty. 
- Go, call the counselor. Go home.

Breakfast! Breakfast! Breakfast! 
[kids screaming] 
Huh?

[kid] Popcorn. Popcorn. Popcorn! 
[phone ringing] 
[man on TV] ...was shot 
and killed by... 
[phone ringing] 
- Okay. Hello. 
- CSC. Is Millie there? 
No. Millie's not there 
right now. What is it? 
Jordan's mother was released from 
prison and a judge found her 
to be able to take care 
of a child. 
I didn't hear what you said. 
What did you just say? 
The judge found she could care for the child and she would like to be reunited immediately. - [kids] Fire! Fire! 
Page 7/44
- Okay. 
Fire! Fire! 
Okay. Everybody outside now. 
Come on. Come on. Come on. 
Come on. 
[kid] Is it a game? 
[Jessie] Come on, let's go. 
[kid] Tiger, Tiger, you got her? [Jessie] Hey, be careful. 
It's okay. 
No breakfast. 
[Jessie] We're good. 
It's over. 
Isn't that gonna explode? 
- No. Come on. Inside. 
- [kids sigh in disappointment] 
- [Jessie] Peaches, come down. Time to go. - Kids, I'm home. 
- [kid] Hey, Millie. 
- You guys ready for school? 
[kids] Yeah. Yes. 
You got a call 
from Child Care Services. 
It's about Jordan. 
Come on, guys. Hurry up. 
Get ready. Get ready. 
[Jessie] Come on, your bags. 
Are you ready? 
You got your jacket? 
Where's your jacket? 
I don't know where my jacket is. - [kid] It's over there...

[melancholic music playing] 
Come here. Come here, baby. 
Come here. 
[melancholic music playing] 
[Millie crying] 
Stop crying in front of Jordan. 
[Millie crying and mumbling] 
I can't help it. 
I raised him when he was 
a little boy. My baby! 
[Jessie] I know. 
Page 8/44
Love you. 
God. Enough of this shit. 
- Warren, what the hell are you doing out here? - Hey, what are you doing? 
Get in the car right now! 
- [cop] Lady! Stop! 
- Not fuckin' playing with you. 
Supposed to be out here, in the 
streets and shit. 
I didn't hit you too hard, 
did I, baby? 
- No. 
- Okay. 
You're Danticia's son, right? 
Yeah. 
Don't tell me now 
to feed him. 
He's a full grown. 
Wait, how old are you? 
How old do you think Peaches is? 
Peaches is missing a tooth. 
- She's five? 
- Five? She's six. 
So you're Shawnte. 
Tiger, Ruben and Peaches. 
We have a little brother 
and a little sister. 
A brother upstairs, Carter, 
he's two and then, 
our teeny little cute sister 
is Sherridane 
and she's about two. 
Jessie's our big brother. 
What I mean, now we have... 
You agreed that you are not 
gonna take any more kids. 
No. But his mother is in jail 
and the house is sealed up and I'm gonna call Social services in the morning. We can't leave that boy 
out there like that. 
[opera music playing] 
Fool! What are you doing? 
- Everybody can see you. 
Page 9/44
- Who? 
- My children. 
- Where are they? 
- In here. 
- Oh. 
Put that shit away. 
[man on radio] Good morning. 
[woman on radio] ...New year. 
Here's what's coming up. 
Where is my purse? 
Thank you. 
I'll be right back. 
Where's her skirt? 
- She lost her skirt. 
- Girl, you showing your panties. What's the matter with you? [kids making fun of the girl] 
What's the matter with her? 
Would you all stop laughing? 
Her daughter was just shot. 
William, give me my coat 
right there. 
Thank you. 
Watch you, whore. Outta here. 
[Shawnte] Oh, no. No! 
What did you call her? 
- You called her a whore? 
- No, no. Stop it. 
Who is she? Don't touch me. 
Don't fuck with her! 
- Come on, man. Drop it! 
- Get off me! 
Any kid can lay down 
on the street, 
but you pick him 
and bring him home. 
This one is... This one is crazy. 
- Go away from me. 
- [shouting] 
Leave him alone. 
Leave him alone. 
- Get in the car. 
- Everytime, this happens. 
He locks himself in there. 
Now we can't get anything 
Page 10/44
out of him. 
Kenny. Hey, Kenny, Kenny. 
Kenny. Kenny. 
I need beer, Kenny. 
I'll kill the first cocksucker 
who comes near me. 
Fuck! 
You see what happens? 
- You little prick. 
- Come on, he's just a boy. 
- Oh go eat shit and die. He's not a boy. - What did you say? 
- Nothing. 
- Now, come on, nutjob. Say what you gotta say. - You want me to say it? Really say it? - Yeah. 
[Millie] Yeah. 
You let your kids run wild. I 
should call Social Services on you. 
How about that? 
- I got a rifle too. 
- Oh, pull the fucking trigger Kenny. Get in the car. Now! 
Come on. Let's go. 
[Jessie] Let's go. 
Oh. That's nice. 
Real fucking nice. 
Call your mama. If you want to, 
I don't give a shit. 
White guy in the neighborhood! 
[kids] Bye, loser! 
[opera music playing] 
[upbeat music playing in car] 
Hey, Millie, how you doing? 
Hey. 
[man on radio] The LAPD officer 
who delivered the most baton 
blows to Rodney King, 
using the video tape 
and police audio transmission, 
prosecutors claim Powell was 
laughing after the beating... 
[man 2 on radio] ...and asked 
us questions about Latasha. 
Page 11/44
They refused to show us the picture of her on the floor bleeding to death. Come on! Let's go! 
[man on TV] He puts his foot down and he's thrown off balance. 
Mr. Briseno is thrown 
off balance. 
Mr. White says this is a stomp, an unnecessary stomp. 
He used his left foot, 
his weak foot, 
not like Mr. Wind, 
he used his weak foot. 
He's right-footed. How... 
is Officer Briseno 
to stop this beating? 
How's he supposed to do that? 
He's supposed to do that by 
his foot instead of his hand. 
He's gotta keep his head 
out of the strike zone. 
Describe the action or the verb in a sentence. 
Okay, now, what's a verb? 
A verb is the action 
in a sentence. 
If he's trying to harm Mr. King, would he use his weak foot? 
If he's trying 
to harm Mr. King? 
Would he do that if his purpose was to apply unnecessary force? That's all. 
[cop siren wailing] 
[cop] Go back to your house. 
Get back inside! Inside! 
Hey! Out of here! 
Anybody! 
Turn that lawyer off! 
We got one white boy in the 
neighborhood and he's losing his mind. Did he go? Did he kick him like a professional football player? [cop] Get back 
Page 12/44
in the house, Sir. 
Not like Mr. Wind, 
he used his weak foot... 
- What are you doing? 
- The cops say anything not to go to jail. I promise you they're going to jail. It's all on tape. 
- What's the matter, are you afraid of him? - Of course he's a fraid of him. 
Mean motherfucker! 
[people shouting outside] 
[man] Get back in the house! 
Back it up! 
Yeah, I can make noise! 
[kids] Push! Push! 
Hold on! Here! 
Oh, my God! 
He threw and destroyed it! 
You see that? 
That's a barricade! 
Stop it or it's your ass. 
[Obie screaming] 
No! No! No! 
[TV running] 
Hey, Jess. 
- What? 
- Give me a minute. 
Jessie. 
Hey, you. What are you doing 
there? What are you doing? 
- Nothing. 
- You're not stealing that stuff, are you? Nobody would steal this. 
Hey! Hey! Hey! 
Stop! You come back here. 
Oh, never. Not in this life or in any life. This is a workplace in hell. 
You bring back whatever 
you stole from there. 
- I didn't steal anything from you. - So we got a Soon Jan Do here? 
Soon Ja what? 
You touch a hair on that girl, I swear to god you're not going home tonight. 
Page 13/44
Yeah. I'm with them. 
Okay? Don't come after me. 
They're angry. 
[speaking in foreign language] 
[speaking in foreign language] 
- [Nicole] Thank you. 
- [man] So you with us? 
- Yeah, I am. 
- I'm Matt. 
- I'm Nicole. 
- Care for a drink? 
Sure. 
Now we aren't gonna put 
anything in these? 
So I better have some more. 
No, babe, you calm down now. 
This is just whiskey. 
Hey, but they're not putting 
anything in it these days. 
Whiskey makes me crazy. 
Oh there's nothing wrong with 
whiskey's making you crazy. 
Yeah, what's with all the bags? This is everything I own. 
What the hell doing here 
with everything you own? 
I was hoping to get killed but that hadn't happened yet, so... So you don't have a place 
to stay? 
I got a friend of a friend. 
Said he'd let me stay in his 
broom closet but I don't know. - You're beautiful. 
- Yeah. 
- She's a real pretty girl, man. - Man, she's marvelous. 
I mean, come on. Look at you. 
Look at those lips. 
Look at me. 
Did you like that? 
- She's like a kid, man. 
- No, she's a little woman. 
Come on, man. Knock this off. 
Page 14/44
Come on, man. Back off. 
She's enjoying it. 
Right? Well, you know 
you'll drive any man crazy. 
How about this? 
Wanna take a ride? 
What do you say? 
You can stay at my place. 
Come here. 
Let me tell you something. 
I'm gonna take you home. 
And you gonna show me 
that round ass, 
those brand new breasts. 
And I'm gonna fuck you. 
And you're gonna love it. 
And you're gonna wrap 
your legs around me. 
I'm gonna fuck you over 
and over and over again. 
You want that, right? 
- Don't even doubt. 
- Let's go somewhere. 
- Come on, man. 
- You need a bath. 
What? 
You're a real big ugly shit, 
you know? 
- What the hell's wrong with you? - You bitch! 
Oh, so now I'm bitch. 
A minute ago, 
- you're heading for sex, you fucking pig. - Motherfucker! 
[both indistinct shouting] 
[Jessie] You shut up, okay? 
[Nicole] Oh, pervert! Come here! Come here! I'll beat 
the shit out of you. 
Are you out of your mind? 
You can't even grab 
a little girl. 
- [Nicole] Fuck you! 
- Hey. 
Page 15/44
No guts, huh? No balls? 
- I bet you're not having a dick. 
- Nigger, is she crazy? 
[both indistinct shouting] 
Who the fuck you are talking to? 
- You lucky. Fuck you, bitch! 
- Get the hell out of it here. 
[man] I'll see you. 
I'll see you. 
Get out of here! 
[cop] You know why 
I pulled you over, sir? 
Where did all my friends go? 
The guys with the whiskey. 
- Come on. Let's go. 
- It's the third time I got pulled over tonight. I don't even have a light out. 
What's the matter? 
Sir, your license, please? 
I got trailed on a freeway. 
I pulled over. 
You guys already wrote me up and some squad stops me down on Normandy. 
I'm not drunk. 
What are you doing? 
You gotta stop it. You 
wanna get yourself killed? 
I need a place to stay 
and I'm tired, okay? 
Close the door, 
it's cold out there. 
Fine. Suit yourself. Move over. 
What I like is a little respect 
for an officer of the law. 
Hey, hey, whoa, easy now. 
You sure you wanna sit 
in their car? Come on. 
- Let's get out of here. 
- No, it's not safe for me out there. - You're driving me nuts. 
- Then you get out of here. 
I'm gonna stay right here. 
And I'm gonna wait to get clubbed, 
that's what we're here for, right? 
Page 16/44
Easy, stay right there. What the hell is going on back here? 
- [man] Where you going? 
- Am I not allowed in jail? 
Prison, juvenile home, 
whatever you got. 
I'm giving myself up, 
I stole in the store. 
We decide who goes 
to the station. 
[man honking] 
Hey! Goddamn it! Hey! 
Both of you shut up! 
Everybody shut up right now! 
God, I hate this fucking job. 
- Please, I shop-lifted. 
- I don't give a shit. 
There are laws against that. 
I need to be taken away. 
I need to be taken away. 
- [man] You cracked me. 
- [cop] Stay back. Sir? 
[man] What if my windshield wipers does not function properly? 
Sir. Get back in there! 
Goddamn it. Get the fuck out 
of my car. 
- [Nicole] Please, please, no. - [cop] Why don't you understand? Get out. You too, fuck face. 
Come on! 
Listen to me. Listen. 
Both of you get out of here now. Do you understand me? 
Go home. Do not come back. 
Is that clear? 
Hey, buddy. Hey, whoa, whoa, 
what the hell! 
What? Get out of your car! 
[gentle music playing] 
[upbeat music playing 
in the house] 
Where you been, lover boy? 
Out fucking? 
Page 17/44
See, I know you was out fucking. I got a way to knowing this shit. I never had whiskey before. 
- That's what she drink? 
- Just shut up! 
Jesus Christ! The goddess 
is showing. 
Man, get out of here. 
She looks good. I wanna keep 
looking at her. 
She's knocked out. 
Had too much alcohol. 
[gentle piano playing] 
Hi. 
Hi. 
How the hell did I get here? 
You don't remember? 
No. 
The last thing I remember, 
I was standing in the street, 
looking at the moon. 
It was a big moon. I'd never 
seen a bigger moon. 
And I remember you. 
[gentle piano playing] 
Where's Millie? 
She's out delivering cakes 
or cutting somebody's hair, 
or swinging a mop somewhere. 
We're still starving. 
Look. Look at this. These kids are always ready for food. 
Man, forget that. Now, we 
have a problem. 
Millie's too stupid to steal 
and we gotta do something. 
We're gonna go to the supermarket and we're gonna take everything we want. So when you are in the supermarket, if they catch you stealing, 
they can only approach you 
when you're out the mall. 
- Okay. 
- Kids, this is Nicole. 
Page 18/44

Okay, all right, you all, 
listen to me. 
This stroller is a perfect tool for shoplifting. 
Quiet! 
Okay. The apartment is empty 
as long as William's mom's gone. You can come 
and go as you please. 
But you're gonna have to use 
the side window. 
The front door's still shut. 
Come, I'll drop you. 
- You all right? 
- [Nicole grunting] 
[gentle piano playing] 
You can spit on the floor here. Oh, God. What is this? 
[kid shouting] 
[kids indistinct chatter] 
[kid mumbling] 
[kids indistinct chatter] 
[kid] Wait, wait, wait. 
Hold this. 
Keep the cheese. 
[kid] It's too big. 
Stay in line. Get in line. 
Stay right here. 
[kids] Run! 
Oh! 
Can anybody give 
some barnacles? 
We're out of it? 
- [all chattering and laughing] - [soulful music playing] 
[Jessie] You want chips 
and taco? 
[Nicole shouting in excitement] [Jessie] Thank you. 
Mmm! God I love chicken. 
And I love eating. 
You want a milk shake? 
Yeah? 
[man on TV] The case that won't Page 19/44

go away due to an argument... 
- Here's you ten. 
- ...a surveillance camera captured the... Kids, come here. Santa's home! 
[kids shouting] 
[kids shouting in excitement] 
Did you steal this? 
- No! 
- Oh, my God. 
It's from Santa. 
[kids shrieking] 
Jessie. 
Some son of a bitch sneaked 
in here and stole the toilet. 
What? 
How did they do that? 
It doesn't have a lock on it 
and it's just two screws. 
[cartoon running on TV] 
[all laughing] 
The world may never know. 
[woman on TV] In Los Angeles, 
to recall a judge 
because of a controversial decision in the killing of a teenager. 
Judge Joyce Karlin still argues 
that Du is no criminal. 
I know a criminal 
when I see one. 
I know a person who presents a danger to the community when I see one. - [kids laughing and chattering] - [soulful music playing] 
Hey! Wait one goddamn minute. 
Where'd you get that? 
Get your own toilet! 
- Hey, William. 
- Hey, come on. 
- [Nicole] I got it. 
- You got it? 
- [Nicole] Okay. 
- Yeah. 
The guy was just walking around. [man on TV] And then at 3:52, 
Page 20/44
watch what you see, 
at 3: 
still moving, 
far higher than 
a push-off position. 
Coming around, 
his head comes around. 
You see Tim Wind appeared 
to start a swing 
and as Mr. King's head is coming 
into that area of swing... 
He's saying that Rodney King 
hit a baton with his face? 
May I see it? 
I'll call you on that. 
Think he's something now. 
He got a gun. 
Dude, you think 
he hot shit now. 
- Nice baby. I love this. 
- Hey, hey. 
Give me the gun. 
And you and Nicole, 
just drop it. 
[ominous music playing] 
Why don't we gun down 
Soon Ja Du? 
[Nicole] Why does everybody in 
town want that Soon Du's ass? 
You new to Los Angeles? 
Soon Ja Du, 
killed that girl Latasha for going to the liquor store to get herself some orange juice. Do you wanna take 
some orange juice? 
What? 
[gunshot] 
Man, what the fuck! 
Latasha died right there. 
Man, I swear to God, one day, you're gonna put a bullet in my heart, 
- and while I'll be laying down dying... - Cheer up, won't happen again. 
Page 21/44
Now, we four against 
killer Soon Ja Du. 
I was thinking about shooting 
her. What do you think, man? 
Best thing we do 
in any situation. 
- Let's do what you wanna do. 
- I wanna shoot her. 
Why not? 
I don't know. 
You let me know when you know. What kind of shit 
you all are on? 
You don't kill people. 
- You don't even talk about it. - Why not? 
Soon Ja Du blew that girl's 
brains out. 
Right now, she's lazing around feeding ducks at parks. 
Wait, that woman 
didn't go to jail? 
No, she didn't. 
- No shit? 
- No shit. 
The judge said jail 
would harm her. 
We do something, we go 
straight to jail. 
Hell, they try to put us 
under the jail. 
- So you in? 
- No, she's not. 
- Killing in against the law. 
- Anything interesting is. 
- Be serious. 
- I am. 
Latasha's life had 
a meaning. 
If you kill someone, 
that'll be the worst fuck up. 
Yeah, take it easy. We shouldn't blow anybody's brains out. 
- Listen to her. 
Page 22/44
- But I could blow her shop up for you. You just give me a bottle, some gas, a tampon and boom. No more shop. - No. 
- Will you give me a place to stay? You don't say shit like that. 
Have you lost 
your goddamn mind? 
- Will do when nobody's in. 
- No! 
Or I could still break those men in half for you. 
[kids chattering] 
I can't leave it. 
[cop car siren wailing] 
What's that? 
No! 
You just wait. 
- What's the plan? 
- To stay the fuck alive. 
We're putting 
all their tires down. 
The plan is to break 
everything you can. 
My masterplan was to live 
at least till the year 2000. 
I gotta reshape it. 
Fuck that guy. 
That's a very nice thing to tell Nicole but she hasn't fucked me yet. Come on. Get in there. 
- What's this? 
- Let's do with your cell phone. - Shit, man, give me that. You good? - Yeah. 
Grab that knife. 
- I want us out of here. 
- Let me do this. 
Let me do this! 
- Fine. 
- William. 
Run! Run! Run! 
[gun shots firing] 
They're gonna shoot us. 
Page 23/44
[gun shots firing] 
[ominous music playing] 
- Take him to the hospital? 
- He got shot. 
He got shot? 
Yes, he did. He got hit. 
William's in there 
praying for death. 
- He got hit. 
- Shut the fuck up. 
Look, man, William 
got grazed by a bullet. 
I didn't get him out of earshot. How you doing? 
- Not well. 
- Show me. 
- Does it hurt? 
- Just a little bit. 
Now rock your toes 
back and forth. 
- Better now? 
- Just regular. 
Bleeding a little. 
- You good? 
- Come on. 
Stop it. 
It's gonna hurt. 
It was the stupidest plan. 
Wasn't even a plan? 
Raid a police station? 
Idiots! 
Man, it's eye for an eye. You 
push me, I'mma push you back. 
It's death. I'm bleeding to death. [Williams chuckling] 
- Look, Nicole 
- Stop it, you're still a baby. Shit, man. It hurts. 
Fuck, this hurts bad. 
We should probably get you 
to a hospital. 
I don't need no damn hospital. All right. Die here. 
See if we'll give a shit.

[dark music playing] 
[woman on TV] The jury is still out on the case against four Los Angeles police men charged in the beating 
of motorist Rodney King. 
It's the sixth day... 
[man on TV] Not only for the 
defendants is the suspense unpleasant, this case unsettled Los Angeles from its very beginning 13 months ago, and with the odds for it 
quiddles over a hung jury 
increasing with every day 
of deliberation, 
a growing number of ministers 
in minority neighborhoods 
are urging 
their congregation... 
[ominous music playing] 
- [kids shouting] 
- Quiet. 
- It's time to come in. 
- We're playing. 
- [kids shouting] 
- [TV news running] 
...only to be told 
"no verdict." 
[man on TV] A lot. We're just 
hoping for a good result. 
[window banged] 
Boys, your dinner 
is getting cold. 
Can you please come in here 
and help me set the table? 
We're almost done. 
[kids shrieking] 
Lady! Hey! Lady! 
I'm trying to work. If you 
can't get them to shut up, 
we're gonna have 
an all-out brawl. 
Look. You don't start nothing. 
There won't be nothing. 
Thank you. 
Page 25/44
[knock at door] 
No, no. 
- [knock at door] 
- Let me handle it. 
[knock getting louder] 
Hmm. Thought you all wanted 
to play. 
We're finished. 
But I called you in, 
three times. 
But you all said 
you wanted to play. 
- Well, now you all can play till the sun comes up. - No, wait. 
[kids] No, wait. Millie, no! 
- [kids] Let us in! 
- It's just gonna be for a minute. 
Teach their little butts 
a lesson. 
[kids begging] 
Boys? 
Boys! 
They're hiding. 
[woman on TV] Again, the issue 
of racism has been introduced. 
The prosecutor asked Powell about a 
message he had sent to another officer 
just before King incident on his 
patrol car's computer terminal, 
referring to his previous call which 
involved a group of African Americans, 
Powell typed, "It was right 
out of Gorillas in the Mist." 
The prosecutor also hammered away at the meaning behind another computer message sent by Powell 
after King was in custody. 
Powell communicating again 
with the same officer typed, 
"Oops, I haven't beaten anyone 
this bad in a long time." 
All right. Come on. Come on. 
Come on. 
This is not that bad. 
Page 26/44
I mean... 
You know, it's not the end 
of the world. 
When someone shut the door 
on you, see if you don't cry. 
Sure. Okay. Let's have a look 
what's on the television. 
Let's see what's on here. 
Hmm. Right. 
Who's hungry? 
Anybody hungry? 
What we got? We got 
beets, we got carrots 
and we got... 
The prosecutor pushed... 
- Shit! 
- Let me guess. 
Okay. You won't like that. 
We don't need that. 
Let's get some cartoons here 
or something. 
Right. 
Who wants pizza? 
- Yeah, I wrote all of this. 
- I already like this one. 
There was... 
- Purple. 
- What? 
- Purple. 
- Purple? 
Cow. 
Say it loud 
I'm black, I'm proud 
Say it loud 
I'm black, I'm proud 
Say it loud 
I'm black, I'm proud 
[Obie] Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah! 
But all the work I did was 
For the other man 
And now we demands a chance 
To do things for ourselves 
[Obie] Give it all.

I'm sorry to bother you but... My kids are here. 
Oh, my God. 
Oh, God. 
I was looking all over for you. Why did you leave the backyard? Told you, never leave 
the backyard. 
We're sorry, Mommy. 
What? You're gonna call 
Social Services on me? 
No.

[Millie] Whisper something 
sweet in my ears.

- Come back to me, baby. 
- Millie. 
[alarm beeping] 
- [Obie] This is a dream. 
- What? 
What the hell? 
- This is just a dream. 
- This is not a dream. 
- May be. 
- You are mine. 
- This is just a dream. 
- You're mine. 
- This is just a dream. 
- You... 
[alarm beeping] 
[switching the alarm off] 
Can I have some milk, please? 
[Obie] Tell me you love it. 
Oh. [laughing] 
[phone ringing] 
Page 28/44
Hello.

Look what they are doing. 
[kid] They look so happy. 
[Shawnte] Of course, 
they're happy. 
We didn't get your shoes 
but we got all kinds of stuff. 
[all laughing] 
What has life done to you? 
Help me. 
Get in. 
[Millie] Jesus. 
He's gonna lose all his blood. 
[Jessie] Fuck! 
The ambulance crews are requiring police escorts to the area. We'll wait... How long is it gonna take? 
There's victims 
all over the place. 
- We know. 
- My friend is dying. 
Do you understand? He's just a 
boy and he's dying out here. 
Please. You have to help us. 
I don't know what to tell you. I'm not getting anything from the police right now. Kids?

Where should we take him? 
Where the fuck are we? 
Where are the street signs? They took away all the fucking street signs. Can't see anything. 
[William coughing]

Careful, Nicole. 
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. 
[Jessie] Get out of here!

Okay. I know. I know. I'm gonna make you all something to eat right now. [kids crying] 
You are really hungry. 
I'll make some food. 
Okay. Just one sec. 
What's he looking for? 
I don't know, maybe, he's trying to find something to break these cuffs. Okay, I'm coming, babies. 
Just give me one... one second. [Millie screaming] 
[Millie screaming] 
God damn it! God damn it! 
You motherfucker! 
Hey, hey! It's dead. 
It's dead. Millie. Millie.

I thought you were the sane one. Hey, come here. Come on. 
Come on.

Page 35/44
Here, here, here. 
[kids crying] 
If that's what you are saying, 
let me tell you, 
you're fucking crazy. 
Now keep really still. 
'Cause I've never done 
this before. 
- Oh, God. Jesus. 
- On three, right? 
Oh! Ha ha! First time! 
- I need a beer. 
- Thank you. 
I gotta find my boys. 
All right. 
I gotta find my car keys. 
I gotta find my boys. 
Where are my keys? 
[door shuts] 
And as God is my judge, I promise you. This will be the end for you, 
of the bacon double cheese burger, the flamed grill chicken burger, the big fish, the bacon king, 
the whopper, the bacon king 
and the cheese whopper. 
Now it's your circus. 
But if you burn down this Burger King, we will never ever rebuild another restaurant in your neighborhood again. So, you could say goodbye to our chicken nuggets, buffalo ranch, honey mustard 
and barbecue dipping sauce. 
To the hand-spun strawberry 
shake, the vanilla soft serve, 
the choco chip cookies. 
You will have to consider 
being done with a hot 
caramel Sunday, 
the strawberry and chocolate 
Sunday forever. 
Free food! 
Where's the fucking hospital? 
[melancholic music playing] 
Page 36/44
[Nicole] Hey, excuse me. 
How do you get to the hospital? 
Get back on Hoover.

[Jessie] Please, open 
your eyes. William! 
[Nicole] William.

of their automobiles, 
beaten unconscious, 
then their pockets picked, 
when they stood up to try to... 
When they, covered in blood, 
tried to get out of the area, they were beaten back to the ground. 
No LAPD officers 
were stationed. They were... 
LAPD has been ordered 
out of this area. 
Also the liquor store, Tom's liquor store here at Normandie and Florence, was fully gutted. People going 
inside with empty hands 
and coming out with...

as if the owner of the shop...

They're nowhere. 
I looked

They're here! 
You have seen anything

Hold it right there. Turn around, 
put your hands behind your head. 
Page 38/44

Now listen to me. 
I'm telling you to do something. - I'm giving you an order.

Well, obviously not right now. 
Now get back in the car.

- This is better than Christmas. Hey! 
Do what you wanna do

But when I get out 
of these things,

[kids] Get in the car. 
Windows! Windows!

Well, was that you? 
I thought it was me. 
I thought I'd just peed myself. It's okay. It's okay. 
[Jessie] It's only a scratch.

Hi, Jessie. 
Hi, Peaches. 
How are you? 
You know what? 
Shawnte and the boys 
were on television 
and I got to play 
with my Barbies all night. 
Are you all right? 
[Jessie crying] 
Yeah. 
Where's Millie? 
She's out 
looking for all of you.

Things looking brighter 
Ooh child 
Things are gonna get easier

Things looking brighter 
Someday we'll get it together 
And we'll get it all done 
Someday when 
The world is much brighter 
Someday we'll walk in 
The rays of a beautiful sun 
Someday when 
The world is much lighter

Someday when 
The world is much lighter
