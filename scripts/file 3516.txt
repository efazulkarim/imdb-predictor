- Wasn't that something? 
- That was great. 
- Great class. 
- Yeah. 
Goodnight, Amber. 
- Bye. 
- Bye. 
Oh God, Marvin...ha! 
Don't do that. 
Come on. 
You're looking like 
a pro, Laura. 
Ah, I'll settle for the workout. You're the last one out. 
Make sure you lock up. 
Okay. 
- See you. 
- See you. 
Bye. 
Oh... 
Oh...oh...Help! 
Help! Help! 
Please, help! 
Help! Help! 
Help! Oh...uh... 
[TV] Here you are. 
Hey, Paulie. 
Would you ever sign 
one of them for us? 
Oh, come on, shake. 
Ah! 
Dr. Davis, telephone, please. 
Dr. Davis, telephone, please. 
Excuse me. 
Are you looking 
for Laura Danvers? 
I'm Dr. Southern. 
My name is Michael Evans. 
I'm the owner of the 
health club where Laura works, where the accident happened. 
Fortunately, it's not 
as bad as it looks. 
But she has sustained burns 
Page 2/30
over portions of her body. 
Burns? 
Yes. 
Chemical burns. 
Chlorine vapor, to be exact. 
It's low grade. 
Hey. 
Never work without 
a spotter, Freddy. 
The weight falls on you chest 
- and you can really get squashed. - Oh. 
I better take a bit of this off. Ah, that's cool. 
This might be 
a little bit much, but... 
Us powerlifters like to 
pump real iron. 
Hey Marv, thanks for checking 
out the new diving board for me. I really appreciate it. 
Marv... 
- Did you try it out yet? 
- No, not yet. 
I will later today. 
Be careful. 
Uh, it's too late. 
Yeah, nice work, Marv. 
I specialize in isometric 
crisis training. 
Freddie, why don't you show 
Darla some powerlifting methods? I think you're the perfect 
person to get her going. 
Hey, no problem. 
So, where do you 
want to begin? 
Well, that depends. 
Well, lets try this one. 
I got it, Freddie. 
I got it. 
I think we should 
help these people. 
What do you say we 
Page 3/30
increase the resistance? 
I love it. 
What fun? 
Hmm, now there's something 
even I can't improve upon. 
Can we see the manager? 
Hello. 
I'm Priscilla Wayne, 
the manager. 
Can I help you? 
Lt. Fletcher, LAPD. 
Detective Stone. 
We have an appointment 
with Mr. Evans. 
Would you like 
something to drink first? 
No, thanks. 
Yeah, coffee. 
All right. 
Laura, one cup of 
carob coffee, please. 
Here you are. 
Right this way. 
Quite an impressive layout 
you have here, Ms. Wayne. 
It's a very 
competitive business. 
It's these extras that 
bring in the clientele. 
And a little gassing 
here and there? 
Ooh... 
You call this coffee? 
She was rescued by 
city paramedics. 
When they get called, 
we get called. 
It was an accident. 
Yeah, but this accident 
nearly dissolved a girl, 
like an Alka Seltzer. 
Are you making any charges? 
I'm Mr. Evans' attorney. 
Ms. Wayne mentioned 
Page 4/30
the computer. 
It runs the spa? 
The computer helps us 
run the spa. 
The system is 
unique to Starbody. 
It controls all the 
automatic functions. 
Who installed the computer? 
Mike, you don't have to 
answer these questions. 
My programmer is 
my brother-in-law. 
My former brother-in-law, 
David Avery. 
Where is he? 
Probably in the computer room. Can we take a look? 
Michael, how is Laura? 
Less than wonderful. 
Who has access to 
this command center? 
I do. 
And David and Priscilla. 
But it's David's baby. 
What do you mean by 
former brother-in-law? 
My wife is dead. 
Good morning, Michael. 
Sleep well? 
We have visitors, David. 
Lt. Fletcher, LAPD. 
Tell him what you know 
about last night. 
I've been running 
all the programs. 
There's no breakdown anywhere. Could someone have 
reprogrammed it temporarily? 
It's not impossible, but you're looking at the only someone 
who knows the system well enough not to leave muddy footprints. Well, that sort of 
Page 5/30
narrows it down to you, 
then, doesn't it? 
Were I interested in 
a life of crime 
would be in computer espionage, electronic blackmail, 
and credit card fraud. 
Assaulting women isn't my style. Where were you last night 
between 9 and 11 ? 
At home, hacking. 
Hacking? 
Hacking. 
Experimenting with 
computer programs. 
Are you sure? 
These are the computer 
printouts from last night. 
You will notice the time, date, and terminal number 
on the upper left-hand 
corner of each sheet. 
Will that suffice? 
I'll check it out. 
I'd like those back 
when you've done, Miss. 
Sergeant. 
Ah! 
It just came off. 
- The board came loose. 
- Hey, somebody help! 
There's been an accident. 
Get in here quick. 
Darla... 
Thanks. 
- The board-- 
- Are you all right? 
It just came loose, 
sprung off it, 
nearly hit me on the way down. How does a goddamn diving 
board just break loose? 
Stone. 
Are you all right? 
Page 6/30
- Ah... 
- Look at me. 
Somebody messed with the bolts. That's just speculation. 
You don't mind if 
we dust for prints, 
do you, counselor? 
Shh. It's all right. 
It's okay. 
A word, David. 
Can we keep it to that? 
You're here because 
you know the system 
and because you're 
Catherine's brother. 
Both circumstances must be 
terribly trying for you. 
If I thought for one moment that you put chlorine in the steams-- You'd resort to the only weapon in your pathetic arsenal. 
Jock violence. 
I think there's a glitch 
in your precious system. 
That's impossible. 
Why are you so full of hate? 
You found some comfort 
for your sorrow, I noticed. 
But then Laura was always 
there for you, wasn't she? 
She and others. Huh? 
I loved Catherine. 
She never wanted that child. 
How do you get things 
so twisted up? 
We shared thoughts 
you'd never understand. 
Twins...you know? 
I just heard about 
the diving board. 
What the hell is 
going on around here? 
So, what do you think? 
I think they ought to 
Page 7/30
give you a roll big enough 
to hold the damn chili. 
No, about the 
Starbody Health Spa. 
I think they ought 
to level the place. 
You think this 
Evans guy is clean, huh? 
I don't know. 
My money is on the wacko 
in the computer room. 
I don't see David clambering up there and unbolting that board. This all could be coincidental. It could be. 
37 deep. 
You got it. 
What quarter is it? 
That was the winning touchdown. Great. 
Flea market special, 
two for the price of one. 
I figured I could be 
Tweedledee 
and you could be Tweedledum 
Fantastic. 
I'm going to check out 
that diving board. 
Marv... 
Thanks. 
Did you read the printout on 
that Evans guy? About his wife? Made the front page 
of the Times. 
She crisped herself. 
She was burned to 
unrecognizable ashes. 
Now, does that suggest 
anything to you? 
Yeah. 
I've got to tell my wife 
to start smoking in bed. 
Race you to the finish. 
You got it. 
Page 8/30
Mike, I just figured out 
what was bothering me 
about Laura's accident. 
When I left the club, 
I know Laura was the 
only one left in the place. 
So? 
Well, how did Priscilla 
happen to find her? 
Maybe she was working late 
and you missed her. 
Then I also missed her car 
in the parking lot? 
You think Priscilla has 
something to do with this? 
You know her better than I do. - Hi. 
- Hi. 
Well, how many reps 
can you do? 
Uh, 15 or 20. 
More if I'm showing off. 
Well, why don't you 
show off for me? 
I never waste effort 
in the gym. 
Besides I'm Beta, 
you're VHS. 
Hey, hop aboard. 
We're due to make land 
in a week. 
Thanks. 
We're like two ships 
that pass in the night. 
And one... 
And one, bounce it out. 
And one, come on now. 
All the way down. 
Come on, stretch it out. 
To the side, one... 
And up. 
Then back and up. 
Here we go. 
And up and back, come on. 
Page 9/30
Up and back. 
How about a vegi shake, 
Rhonda. 
Sure. 
I mean, it's kind of 
creepy and all. 
On Monday, 
Laura gets gassed 
and on Tuesday, 
the diving board collapses. 
Oh, this thing. 
Ah! 
Oh my God. 
Ha, I got you. 
It's just a tomato. 
That's sick. 
Here's your shake. 
Uh, sorry. 
I lost my appetite. 
Back and forth, come on. 
Yeah, that's it, all right. 
Up in the air. 
Yes, come on. 
Good jumping today. 
All right. 
All right. Let's do 
the combination, 
center floor, first group. 
Come on. 
Yeah. 
What's with the 
goddamn bird's nest? 
It's a pretty sick joke 
considering she's your sister. What are you talking about? 
Whatever you're trying to pull, you're not going to 
get away with it. 
You know, Michael, 
you need medical attention. 
Just watch yourself 
or you're going to need 
medical attention. 
What are you wearing 
Page 10/30
for Mardi Gras? 
Do you think Snow White 
might be pressing my luck? 
Hey, turn the 
goddamn lights back on. 
Ooh, not bad, honey. 
Can you get us some 
men in here, too? 
Ah! Ah! 
Ah! 
Ah! Ah! 
Are you two all right? 
Yeah, but to tell you 
the truth, Michael, 
this place could use 
better maintenance. 
Yeah, who needs weight 
reduction through terror? 
I'm sorry about the showers. 
I want to extend your 
memberships for three months, 
no charge. 
Drop by my office and I'll 
take care of it personally. 
Do you think you can 
handle both of us 
after jazz class tomorrow? 
Well, I can sure 
have fun trying. 
Alright, 
I'll see you tomorrow. 
What's it look like in there? 
It's calming down. 
Darla's cut isn't serious 
and Marci should be 
out in a second. 
She's pretty shaken up, 
but she's going to be all right. Why did you come back to the 
club the night Laura got hurt? I forgot my purse. 
Lucky for her you did. 
Ahoy there. 
How's it going, Freddie? 
Page 11/30
- Hello, Robert. 
- Sparta. 
Resistance is set 
at 1 20 pounds. 
Anyone seen the white whale? 
Increase to 1 30 pounds. 
Increase to 140 pounds. 
Increase to 1 50 pounds... 
Help...come here, somebody! 
Help me! 
Help! 
- Let go of it! 
- I can't! 
Increase to 350 pounds... 
Increase to 360 pounds... 
Ugh...ugh... 
Tom, the guy is 
torn to pieces. 
You put those 
machines on manual 
and you're going to end 
what's unique about the club. 
The computer had nothing 
to do with the accident. 
That system of yours 
means more to you 
than people's lives, 
doesn't it? 
This system is a marvel. 
It made the club a success. 
You can't blame the computer for tiles flying off shower walls. The computer doesn't 
control tiles for Christ's sake. All right, all right, all right. Mike, the other partners and 
I agree that it is vital that 
nothing ruin the success of the Mardi Gras party Saturday night. I mean, we had a 20% increase 
in membership last year 
due to that party. 
Now, you put these 
machines on manual 
Page 12/30
and half the stuff 
isn't going to work. 
I say we shut the 
system down now. 
I'll make a bargain with you. 
The day after the party, 
you want to shut down 
the whole damn club 
for remodeling, 
I'll back you 100% . 
That won't be necessary. 
Mike, it's going to be okay. 
You got to trust me 
on this one, buddy. 
All right. 
Aren't you supposed to 
be picking up Laura 
at the hospital? 
Come on, let's go. 
Come on. 
Hmm, sure beats hospital food. Oh, thank you, sir. 
Hmm, that's not fair. 
I can't see a kiss coming. 
I may never take 
these bandages off. 
I want you to 
move in with me. 
Only on one condition. 
What? 
We take a drive by the club 
so I can pick up my things. 
See you, have fun. 
What are you doing tonight? 
You want to come with us? 
- Yeah. 
- Goodnight. 
- What time? 
- Oh, about an hour or so. 
See you later. 
I'll come over 
and pick you up. 
- I'll meet you. 
- Okay, great. 
Page 13/30
- See you. Bye-bye. 
- See you later. 
They're going to 
lock you in, Marci. 
Don't worry about me. 
I'll get out. 
Ah! 
Ow... 
I'm not much help 
to you, am I? 
Do you see the one with 
number 22 on the door? 
Oh yes, here. 
Okay. 
Give me a minute 
to get to my office 
so I can turn the 
security lock off 
and then you can open. 
I'm not going anywhere. 
Michael? 
Who is it? 
Michael? 
Hi, Michael. 
How do you like my costume? 
Bad taste, Darla. 
Whenever I'm in the club 
and even sometimes 
when I'm in this house, 
I feel a presence. 
It's Catherine. 
Even in death, 
she still has a hold on you. 
I feel like she's 
reaching out somehow 
and causing all this trouble. 
It's the dreams, 
the accidents, 
and those messages 
on my computer. 
I don't know. 
Goodnight, sweetheart. 
This cigarette case 
was found in the rubble 
Page 14/30
of the mansion 
in upstate New York that 
burnt to the ground 
under mysterious circumstances at the turn of the century. 
It belonged to the 
matriarch of the family 
who had come over from Europe 
in the middle 1 7th century 
and built the first 
house on the site. 
Oh, she was murdered by 
her youngest daughter, 
beheaded with an ax. 
Four subsequent houses 
have burned to the ground. 
There is no longer a house. 
The present owner has tried to farm the land on which it stood but nothing will grow. 
It is a barren, 
dead piece of earth. 
Cigarette? 
I don't smoke. 
What I've just demonstrated 
is called psychometry, 
the ability to acquire, 
while in contact with an object, paranormal knowledge 
of its history 
or facts about its present 
or previous owners. 
How does this all help me? 
You did bring an object 
belonging to your late wife, 
Mr. Evans? 
Ah, Catherine. 
Ah, and a beautiful 
marriage it was, too, 
until she went into labor 
with your child 
and something happened 
to her lower spine, 
a cripple growing 
Page 15/30
progressively more bitter 
and depressed. 
Jealous, too. Of you? 
Without justification. 
After she lost the baby, 
I couldn't reason with her. 
And then, one day, 
she went into the garden, 
doused herself with gasoline 
and set herself on fire, 
burned to unrecognizable ashes. All of which was in 
the news a year ago. 
You're going to have to do 
better than that, Dr. Moray. 
Ah... 
A bird's nest. 
That's what she thought 
of your family, 
like a bird building its nest, the mama bird, 
the papa bird, 
and the baby. 
Then why would 
she kill herself? 
You work in this 
business long enough, 
you see things. 
After she died, I didn't 
give a damn about anything. 
Laura came along, pulled me 
out of it, but it just-- 
But afraid to build 
another nest. 
Exactly. 
But now, you think that your 
late wife is trying to kill you? Well...somebody could be 
trying to drive me crazy. 
For what purpose? 
My brother-in-law, 
Catherine's twin. 
He hates my guts. 
Hmm. 
Page 16/30
Why don't I come 
down to your club? 
You can say I'm an 
insurance investigator. 
You need one. 
I'll hang around 
until after closing 
and see what I can find out. 
Do you need me for anything? 
One of the reasons that 
I left the seminary 
for parapsychology, 
Mr. Evans, 
was the desire to separate 
true spiritual phenomena 
from fraudulent deception. 
There is more to this job than things that go beep and buzz. 
I'll see you at 
the club tonight. 
You love me, don't you? 
I can't do this anymore. 
Catherine, we're hurting people. Yes, you can. 
No. 
[moaning] 
There, that's better. 
They're so weak, 
and together we are 
so strong. 
Mr. Evans, a woman 
named Marci Hewitt, 
a member of your 
club is missing. 
- Marci? 
- Yeah. 
Her boyfriend said he 
hadn't seen her for two days. 
The last he knew she 
was going to your club. 
Her car was found abandoned in the neighborhood this morning. I haven't seen Marci 
at least for two days. 
Page 17/30
What a fantastic 
weight reduction program. 
People get so thin, 
they disappear. 
How's the investigation going? It's going. 
Hi, Michael. 
Ready to make good 
on your promise? 
Of course. 
Okay, we'll see you 
in an hour then. 
- All right. 
- Okay? 
Linda, come on. 
The security system 
will be off at night, 
so you can roam about freely. 
Fine. 
Enjoy the evening. 
Fine. 
[crosstalk] 
Linda. 
Here's a note for you. 
You know, what do 
you need, a raise? 
No. 
Almost ready? 
Actually, it's so late. 
I've got to run. 
Do you think you can 
handle Michael for both of us? - With pleasure. 
- Okay. 
Hey, let me borrow 
your hairspray. 
Yeah, here. Okay. 
Michael? 
Michael, are you here? 
This isn't funny, Michael. 
I'm leaving. 
Ah! 
What is it? 
Turn it off! 
Page 18/30
Ah! 
Oh, my head! 
Oh... 
Help! 
Help me! 
Ah! Help! 
It's burning! 
My eyes! 
Ah! Ah! Ah! 
Michael? 
Did you forget your keys? 
Laura, it's David. 
David? 
What's wrong? 
Michael asked me 
to drop by 
and check out 
the home terminal. 
One of the programs 
keeps hanging. 
He never said anything to me 
about you coming by. 
He's had a lot on 
his mind lately. 
Laura, it's nice to see you. 
I was so sorry to hear 
about your accident. 
Thank you. 
Well, I know my 
way to the study. 
Wasn't it sweet of Michael 
to bring you here? 
Yes. 
Yes, it was. 
It was nice. 
How strange for him though 
having a woman here so soon 
after my sister's passing. 
That...That was over 
a year ago, David. 
It was that long ago, 
wasn't it? 
A man must get on with 
the business of living. 
Page 19/30
How long will you be? 
Do I make you nervous? 
David, I know you have 
some kind of crazy idea 
that Michael 
and I were involved 
while Catherine was still alive, but that couldn't be more false. Laura, I'm deeply hurt. 
I have no such suspicions. 
And I really liked your sister even when she was 
so mean to me. 
I know. 
Don't. Don't. 
I'm sorry. 
I guess I just 
want to be alone. 
I understand, dear. 
I really do. 
Huh... 
Would you please... 
Would you please answer it? 
Of course. 
David, I didn't expect 
to see you here. 
Michael asked me to drop 
by with the groceries. 
I'll take care of it. 
Have you seen David? 
Oh, no. 
Laura? 
Are you all right? 
Sure, just sleeping. 
David came by. 
David? 
What the hell 
was he doing here? 
Fixing your terminal. 
I didn't tell him 
to come here. 
What's that little 
bastard up to? 
What is it? 
Page 20/30
Hmm? 
What's wrong? 
You're upset. 
I saw a parapsychologist today. God, I am a nervous wreck, 
alright? 
I'm almost done, 
almost done. 
Give me a... 
Just making sure the computer 
no longer controls 
the air conditioning. 
So, tomorrow night 
instead of Mardi Gras, 
we're going to have 
a summer hothouse. 
Huh, huh... 
[sinister laughing] 
Ah! 
Michael? 
Michael. 
Come to me. 
Come to me. 
I need you. 
It's so easy. Then we can 
be together forever. 
Jump, jump, jump. 
Moray! 
Dr. Moray! 
Moray! 
Tom! 
Open up! 
- ls that you, Mike? 
- Yo. 
Morning, Tom, old buddy. 
Morning, Mike. 
Why all the good cheer? 
Why shouldn't I be cheerful? 
My club's being sabotaged. 
Laura is temporarily blinded 
and my lawyer has got the 
cutest shorts I've ever seen. 
We don't know it's 
sabotage, Mike. 
Page 21/30
Where did you find this? 
Do you know that I've been 
looking for this watch 
for the past two days? 
You don't know when 
to quit, do you? 
Mike, I don't know what finding a lost watch has to do with any... Are you helping Tom 
destroy our club? 
What? 
I found his watch this morning in the utilities room. 
Are you involved? 
Michael, I was... 
Which one of you put the 
chlorine in the steam system? 
That could have killed Laura. 
That steam room door doesn't lock. She should have been 
able to get out. 
And Robert? 
And the broken diving board? 
Those messages 
on my computer? 
I didn't know anything 
about any messages. 
Mike, I think the strain 
of the last week 
has been getting 
to you, buddy. 
It all fits. 
The computer system fouls up. 
I take the blame and you 
and your partners buy me out. 
Who else is in on this? 
It's just the two of us. 
Michael, I really am sorry. 
David isn't involved with you? No. 
Priscilla seems to know 
more about this than I do. 
Have a nice day. 
We could still get the club. 
Page 22/30
We just need to 
adjust the spa's books. 
I've known some real pricks, 
but you're the king. 
Priscilla, baby. 
Take it as a compliment. 
Just stay the hell 
away from me. 
We should stop now. 
I see their faces. 
I hear their screams. 
It's horrible. 
Their flirtations annoyed me. 
I am tired of 
waiting for Michael. 
No, please. 
I can't. 
I don't want to. 
We've only just begun. 
Oh, please, please, no. 
No, no!!! 
Looking for me? 
Have you seen David? 
No. 
Are you all right? 
Have you seen a guy 
named Moray? 
Who's he? 
Come on. 
The minute you find David, 
I want you to grab him. 
What's up? 
Just grab him 
and sit on him. 
Then find me. 
I'm stopping his 
bullshit right now. 
What do we need? Stereo? 
- Lights? Security system? 
- Yeah. 
We have generator 
power for that, right? 
Right. 
I'm putting the 
Page 23/30
machines on manual. 
And that's the end of that. 
I like it. 
- Here's my ID card 
- Yeah. 
If David gets in here, 
I want you to be able 
to get him out. 
That thing stays off. 
You got it. 
I'm going to break in. 
Are you sure this guy 
still lives here? 
Yeah, he lives here. 
He doesn't live here alone. 
Yeah. 
Lt. Fletcher, homicide. 
I want an APB on David Avery. 
Male Caucasian, 
29-30 years old, 
slight build, 
about 6 feet tall, 
135 pounds, 
reddish blond hair, 
probably a psycho. 
Oh, and get this. 
He might be in drag. 
Yeah, right. 
I knew this guy was a wacko. 
I'm going to the club. 
Starbody. 
Jeffery, Michael Evans. 
Oh, hi, Michael. 
Has David shown up yet? 
No, no. 
I haven't seen him. 
Go to the computer 
room and stay on guard. 
Don't let anybody in 
except Marvin and me. 
Tell Marvin to come to the 
front desk and watch for David or anyone that's dressed like... like Catherine. 
Page 24/30
What? 
David might be dressed 
like his twin sister. 
Just get the message 
passed on to him. 
Okay... 
Well, like, I thought he was going to be here a half-hour ago... 
This place ought to be lousy 
with good-lookin' bimbo's. 
I'm sure they'll go crazy for 
garlic and pepperoni breath. 
Got any gum? 
Hey. 
Excuse me. 
Sorry. I, uh... 
I thought you were a friend. 
Excuse me. 
Sgt. Stone? 
Lt. Fletcher? 
Michael should be in 
at any moment. 
There's a bar 
in the aerobics room. 
Uh... 
Uh...ah. 
Excuse me, miss. 
Hey, how did you do that? 
You know, you're not supposed 
to be in the computer room here. How did you get in anyway? 
The door was locked? 
Well, um, maybe you could 
stay for a little while. 
Nice, uh, arms. 
Uh...You know, 
I really could get in a 
lot of trouble for this. 
What's your name? 
Ah! 
- Laura, my God, look at you. 
- Oh Marvin, hi. 
- You look fantastic. 
- Oh, put me down. 
Page 25/30
Oh God, it's great to 
see the world again. 
Where's Michael? 
- He'll be along in a minute. 
- Oh, okay. 
Come on, Laura. 
Let's go get a drink. 
- See you later. 
- All right, see you-- 
Did you see that guy? 
He looks great. 
Oh... 
Want some of that? 
How's it going, Jeffrey? 
So you're okay? 
Hi, Jeffrey. 
- Where's Laura? 
- Headed for the bar. 
- How's her eyes? 
- Beautiful. 
Okay, great. 
Priscilla's looking for you. 
Who are you? 
Where are you taking me? 
Ha! 
Say goodbye to 
your club, Michael. 
- No-- 
- No. 
[speaking Japanese] 
Need some help? 
Huh? 
I asked if you could use a hand. Ah, sure. Why don't you 
help with these. 
What a hot party, Tom. 
What do you think? 
Yeah, but it's 
hotter in the sauna. 
What do you say? 
What a shock, poor dear. 
The dead past 
returning to haunt you. 
Hello, Michael.

Resistance is set at maximum. 
Hello, sweetheart. 
Welcome to my party. 
Where's Laura? 
Working on her tan. 
Careful. 
One flick of a button 
and she's fried chicken. 
What do you want? 
Haven't you been 
getting my messages? 
I'm lonely. 
I want you with me. 
Killing yourself 
isn't so hard really. 
And besides you'll be 
saving all your friends. 
I will destroy this place 
and I'll kill them all 
unless you do as I say. 
Get away from there, Michael. 
Oh, this is a great, Tom. 
Ah... 
Tom! 
Ah, ah! 
Ha, ha, ha... 
Oh God! Oh... 
Ah! Ah! 
No! 
David? 
Ah... 
David, I need your help. 
No! 
You have to go the way I did. 
And if you don't, 
you're going to 
watch Laura burn. 
All right. 
But let her go first. 
Don't give me ultimatums! 
If you kill her, 
you'll never have me. 
You'd kill yourself for her. 
You love her that much, 
Page 27/30
don't you? 
David, fight back. 
Ooh. 
No! 
Oh, God. 
No! 
Michael. 
No! 
David. 
Ah... 
That weakling 
is gone forever. 
And your time is running out. 
No! 
Ugh. 
Now is your chance, Michael. 
Come with me into the inferno. Let's die together 
and live forever in hell. 
Uh... 
Marvin... 
What's the matter? 
Is he okay? 
Everyone in this place 
is going to die. 
We're out of booze here. 
There's more in 
the aerobics room. 
You know, 
this stuff isn't bad. 
Keeps you skinny, too. 
All it needs is, uh, 
a little vodka. 
Now what? 
- Ah! 
- Miss. 
Why don't you try-- 
Ah! 
Give me it...Give me it... 
Ah! 
Stone! 
I can't...stop! 
I can't get it off! 
It's unplugged! 
Page 28/30
Oh, God... 
Ah! 
Come on, get off! 
Get off! 
Come on. 
Oh my God. 
No, I can't get it off! 
Stone! 
- Somebody! 
- Ah! 
Come on, get off! 
Help! 
Jesus Christ, get in here! 
Stone! 
Come on... 
I can't... 
Oh my God. 
Ah! 
Help, help! 
Ah! 
Oh, Jesus Christ! 
Ah! 
Help! Help me! 
Ah, help me! 
What the fuck?! 
Stop! Ah! 
Somebody help! 
Help! 
Ah! 
Fletcher. 
Oh... 
Oh, I feel sick. 
Fletcher. 
Are you there? 
Hey, Fletch. 
Ha, ha, ha, ha... 
I got to get to the power. 
Can you walk? 
Are you okay? 
I'll survive. 
I'll go get Fletch. 
Fletch... 
Oh... 
Ah! 
Page 29/30
Hey. 
Run! Run! 
Alright, bitch. 
I'll show you fried chicken. 
Michael! 
Ah! 
Michael! 
Ah... 
The computer locked it. 
Aw, fuck this computer shit. 
What the hell happened? 
It's Catherine. 
She took over David's body. 
Oh...oh... 
Wait, wait, wait. 
Marvin. 
- Jesus, you finally got it. 
- Thank God you're all right. 
Nice try, Michael. 
Ah...
