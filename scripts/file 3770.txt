Well, she died

No.

She gave up long ago.

You haven't even seen her

Nothing will change for you.

Or for you, Dmitri.

Where are we going, Papa?
To the funeral?

If you take own life, you do

So then, where are
you taking us?

We go to hunt.

There have been new sightings

Careful with those.

Put the cards away now,

Your mum and dad

It's just a game, Granny.

You think my cards
are just pretty pictures.

Think again, Calypso.

They show us the unseen road.

What?

-Like, predict the future?
-Mm-hmm.

In the right hands.

Lay three cards down.

The first card is the subject.

CALYPSO:
The High Priestess?

You do come from a long line
of very powerful women.

The second card is
the situation.

The Tower.

There's going to be
a terrible accident.

The third card is the outcome.

Strength.

There is great danger
in that card.

I have something
for you, Calypso.

I was going to wait
until you were older,

but the cards have shown us
you will need it very soon.

What is it?

A potion.

The formula has been
passed down

in our family for generations.

What does that symbol mean?

GRANDMOTHER: It's a sign
of the spirit Papa Legba.

He opens the gate
to the other side.

Protect it.

Very powerful.

Go ahead.

It will heal whoever drinks it
in undreamed-of ways.

You will know Zar

He sound like thunder

You have seen this beast?

I have seen his work.

This cat has k*lled two dozen,
maybe three dozen men.

Yes?

For as long as men like you
have been coming down here

to k*ll lions,

there have been legends
of the one who can't be k*lled.

NIKOLAI:
Men like me.

But you still take my money,

I'm always thinking

I want you to be my partner.

What is your name?

I'm a guest here of Vladimir.

Aleksei Sytsevich.

No.

You do not have name.

In this world,
you barely exist.

So, what can some

offer up to the Kravinoffs?

-Nothing.
-[SHORT CHUCKLE]

I am here...

So, be quiet.

Hope Father gets him this time.

Why?

Well, because then
he'll become a legend,

and we don't have
to come here again.

A true legend would fight fair.

And now, today's headlines.

Crusading London prosecutor
Samantha Hodges

was gunned down last week
in broad daylight

following a string
of vicious attacks

targeting law enforcement
and the judiciary.

Memorial services
will be held later today.

[CLOSES LAPTOP]

[SNIFFLES]

CALYPSO: I met Samantha
when I first moved to London.

She was a mentor,

a dear friend,

and one of the fiercest
fighters for justice

this city has ever known.

We all know who did this.

Samantha dared to stand
in Semyon Chorney's way

and hold him accountable.

And for that act of courage,
she lost her life.

This system's broken.

[LOW CHATTER]

-I'm sorry about your friend.
-sh*t.

I didn't mean to scare you.

Well, you did.

Sorry for your loss.

Did you know her well?

Actually, I didn't
know her at all.

Well, then, thank you
for the condolences.

Calypso.

I think this belongs to you.

You're...

You're the boy.

But no, you were...

-You were re--
-I was.

For three minutes.

Would have been
a whole lot longer

if you hadn't been there.

Those were
my grandmother's cards.

I actually still carry
the deck with me.

So, why'd you give it to me?

Guess I thought you needed it.

This all you had to go on?

How'd you find me?

Hunting people down
is sort of my thing.

Hunting?

You know who did this?

Yeah, I do.

They gonna get him?

Probably not.

What would you say
if I told you...

...I already did?

A tiger's tooth?

I use whatever tools
are available.

Why would you do that?

Wasn't he responsible
for k*lling your friend?

Look, I've been trying to
find you for a very long time.

This is my way of saying
thank you for saving my life.

I didn't ask you
to m*rder anyone.

I'm a lawyer.

But that bastard got
what he deserved.

I know who your father is.

You're like him?

A gangster?

No.

I grew up watching my father
put evil into the world.

The old man had it
all figured out.

I was supposed to follow
in his footsteps

and take over
the family business.

Something happened to me
that day you found me.

So, I got as far away
from my father as I could.

And now I do what I can
to get rid of people like him.

So, you're The Hunter?

That's just what they call me
in the press.

I prefer Kraven.

Kraven?

Hmm. With a "K."

Hmm.

But the only people who have
heard that name are dead now.

Then I guess I'll just
have to watch my back.

[SERGEI LAUGHING]

CALYPSO:
So, do you live here?

[STAMMERS]
I live about as far away

as you can possibly get
from this place.

But my brother does.

We, um...

[SIGHS]

I wasn't always there
for him, so I...

check in when I can.

What about you?

How'd you end up here?

Some days, I'm not so sure.

Um...

My parents were lawyers,
so that's what I did.

I was in the D.A.'s office
in New York for seven years

until I couldn't
take it anymore.

Sometimes, the law can
get in the way of justice.

It can.

Now I'm in London,

at one of the biggest law firms
in Europe.

I know where you work.

You're one of the best
investigative lawyers

in that place.

I also know...

all your clients
aren't exactly angels.

That's true.

So, what are you really getting
done from behind that desk?

I have a list.

A list?

There are other ways to do

what you set out to do,
Calypso.

[PAPER RUSTLING]

Well, you're gonna need
a lawyer, or worse,

if you keep messing around
in this world.

What about a partnership?

From inside that firm,
you can find people I can't.

-And then I could do what...
-Yeah, I get it.

I'll think about it.

Kraven.

And a little friendly advice.

If you keep going after
the names on that list,

people you care about
are gonna get hurt.

it was The Hunter.

Cunning as a fox.

More ferocious than a tiger.

this Hunter actually exists?

Could be a load of bollocks.

But then again,
I hear he's got a list.

Once you're on it,
you never come off.

And there's a good chance
you're on it.

ALEKSEI: Nikolai Kravinoff's
son, Sergei, is The Hunter?

But what is this, uh, Kraven?

Apparently, that's what
he calls himself.

This can't be real.

-Can it?
-Not sure.

Put The Foreigner on this.

He's a bit of a freak,

but he's been obsessed
with The Hunter for years.

Maybe he can figure out
what the f*ck is going on.

Hey.

-Great, let's stay in.
-What?

It's my birthday.

On your birthday,

we can go to the petting zoo,

or wherever it is
you let loose.

But tonight, this.

What makes you think
I can fit in that?

This is too big on me,
so it would be perfect for you.

-Sorry.
-Thank you.

Nice perfume, by the way.

Thanks, but I'm not
actually wearing any.

[SNIFFS]

[WHISPERS]
No.

She was gonna find out
soon enough.

DMITRI:
Papa was sitting right here.

It all happened so fast.

You find out what you're
made of in a moment like that.

I'm a coward.

Dima, you're not a coward.

It's natural to feel fear.

That's just
your instinct talking.

Why don't we get
to choose who we are?

Why do I have to be me?

I need to be strong, fearless.

I would run towards
the b*ll*ts.

I won't crumble to the ground.

Dima, why would you want
to be anybody but yourself?

So he'd respect me for once.

Papa's a criminal.

So, what good is his respect?

You act like you don't care
what he thinks.

That you're... you're above it.

-That he can't touch you.
-Well, he can't.

He made you hate people.

I don't hate people.

I hate what people do,
but I don't hate people.

I guess, then,
Papa was right about one thing.

Yeah? What's...?

[IMPERSONATING Nikolai]
Men should be the only animal

NIKOLAI: I'm glad

Dmitri.

I don't expect you to give me

Hmm.

[SPEAKS RUSSIAN]

I just came for one toast,

to honor Dmitri on his big day.

Pour.

[GLASSES CLINKING]

I think you left your shoes

There ain't enough volts

-there, my friend.
-Ryan.

Everything's fine.
He's a client.

What the hell, Sergei?

I told you
I'd think about your offer.

You cannot come in here
like this.

This is my place of business.

They got my brother.

Who got your brother?

There were four of them.

Took him from his place.

So, you saw them?

There was this one guy.

Dark hair, brown eyes.

He's got a scar
under his left eye.

Sounded Turkish.

Jesus.

You spoke to them.

Not exactly.

But there was
some screaming involved.

[SIGHS]

Okay.

Let's get into it, then.

I should've been there for him.

I couldn't sleep, so...

I left and went for a walk
and my...

-We're gonna find him.
-[SIGHS]

Okay?

I'm gonna do what I do,
get us a name.

And then you are going to do
what you do.

And we will get him back.

I'm looking for a mercenary

who just ran a kidnapping op
in London.

Moon-shaped scar
under his left eye.

Smokes Turkish cigarettes,
probably a national.

Find him.

NIKOLAI:
Sergei.

-Who are they?
-They would not say.

But you know, don't you?

My list of enemies is long.

Look what they did to him.

How much do they want?



[SETS BOX ON DESK]

Pay them.

It is complicated.

No, it's not. It's very simple.

You have the money,
and he's your son.

This is not about money.

This is about power.

If I pay, I am weak.

If I show weakness,

I begin to lose everything
I've spent lifetime building.

A lifetime building what?

You're a drug dealer.

[GROWLING SIGH]

You don't get
to do that anymore.

Dmitri is innocent.

You let him die,
his blood is on your hands.

On my hands?

My hands?

I did not abandon him.

You abandoned him.

You.

He was dead
the moment he was taken.

Whether I pay or not.

No, you do--
You don't know that.

Yes, I know.

Because that is
what I would do.

You're despicable.

Of course I want him back.

I want both my sons back.

How'd it go?

She took it.

Of course she took it.

But did she believe you?

We met once,
on your father's hunting trip.

DMITRI:
I, uh, don't remember.

No, you wouldn't.

My hair was different.

You were very young.

Me?

I never forgot.

So, have you spoken
to my father?

Has he agreed to pay?

[LAUGHING]
No.

Nikolai Kravinoff was never
going to hand over $20 million

to get his bastard son back.

You're an accident, Dmitri.

You came into this world
as an accident,

and you came into my possession
as an accident.

So, can I go?

Those men who took you,
they weren't there for you.

They were there
for your brother.

Sergei?

Both of you went in,
but when my guys got up there--

poof-- he'd vanished.

As he always does.

So, I took you.

I got lucky.

Why would you ever want Sergei?

He never hurt anyone.

You really don't know, do you?

Know what?

ALEKSEI:
Wait for the end.

That's the best part.

DMITRI:
Kraven?

Apparently, that's what
he calls himself now.

You think my brother Sergei
is The Hunter?

The Hunter is a story.

A fable to put fear
into criminals.

Clearly, you didn't know
your brother very well.

What do you mean "didn't"?

Kraven had a list.

Once you're on it,
you never come off.

So, I went after him first.

[ROCKS CLATTERING]

We've got Kraven.

-Sergei, what are you...?

sh*t.

There are five guys walking
into my building right now

who do not look like
they belong here.

You need to get
out of there now.

Get to the cargo terminal
at Stansted.

I'll have someone
meet you there.

I call this my feed bag.

It's a mixture of medications
to manage my condition.

What happened to you?

I was underestimated, too.

In and out of hospitals.

They never quite knew
what was wrong.

I knew I would never have
your father's respect...

or anyone else's,
until I was strong.

I tried everything.

-And then...
-[ZIPPER WHIZZING]

...I found someone.

In New York,

a biochemist, a professor,
Miles Warren.

He was developing a procedure

to increase strength, tenfold.

I signed up on the spot.

My skin, it started to harden.

-[SKIN CRACKLING]
-I was indestructible,

like a rhino.

[STRAINING]
But the pain...

...it was too much.

[INHALES]

I think there is an animal
in each one of us, Dmitri.

I'm taking over
your father's territory.

I want you to be my partner.

The Kravinoff name
still opens a lot of doors,

and you'll finally get
the consideration you deserve.

You're right.

I have been underestimated.

My whole life.

But if you think
I'm gonna betray my family,

you're wrong.

[g*n RACKS]

Boss, the boys haven't
checked in.

I've seen her around
since she was a cub,

but she's a lot bigger
than I remember.

Oh, you're a g*dd*mn lunatic.

I swear.

Oh, you just
figure that out now?

I know I hired you for the job,

but what is Kraven to you?

Why the obsession?

My mentor was one of
the greatest assassins

who ever lived.

He taught me everything I know.

He was like a brother to me.

Maybe you knew him?

Hmm. Of him.

He was m*rder*d.

One man made it inside
and cut his throat.

Kraven?

So, I traveled the world,

followed him wherever he went.

But Kraven is
nature's perfect predator.

He has no known weaknesses.

[BREATHES DEEPLY]

But you found one.

And I know how to exploit it.

Well, get to the part
where I start to give a sh*t.

These are
Eastern Siberian rosary peas.

A rare species.

I found their residue
on a poison in the monastery.

These peas are only native to
a specific region in Siberia.

That's where we'll find him.

Mm-hmm.

Rosary peas?

You seem to know your stuff.

They'll k*ll you.

Or save you.

Nature's funny like that.

What are you trying to do here?

Tell me about this.

It was my grandmother's.

We were on safari
visiting her that day.

I've been trying to figure out
what was in here for years.

My grandmother was
kind of a... mystic.

She had a lot of
crazy stuff around.

My parents didn't like
to talk about it,

but she was
a very powerful woman.

She said it would heal
whoever drank it,

in undreamed-of ways.

I was... I was just a kid.

I didn't know
what it would actually do.

This saved my life.

Did it?

-Trust me. It changed me.
-Exactly.

Look at what you became.

I need to know
what was in here.

And if you can get any more.

No.

She died not long after
that trip,

and I never saw her again.

I heard back
from one of my sources.

The Rhino's on the move.
We should know more very soon.

I knew you'd be good at this.

Sergei, we're gonna
get Dmitri back,

but is all of this
really worth it?

Calypso, I was made to do this.

I'm the greatest hunter
on this planet.

It's undeniable.

There's nobody I can't track
down, nobody I can't beat.

There's nobody can
even touch me, so, no.

Why would I want to stop?

It's called karma.
She catches up to you.

Not me.

I'm faster than she is.

But Dmitri wasn't.

Interesting piece.

It's gonna take more than
a g*n to k*ll Kraven.

I find this formula
that was developed by MI6

to be particularly effective.

May I?

so you and I,

we work together.

You could be my partners.

Or I k*ll you and burn...

And he will.

But, Dmitri, that's not you.

[STRAINED GURGLING]

I wish...

I wish I never met

you Kravinoffs.

Sergei.

How did you find me?

I'm a hunter.

It's what we do.

You sent the video
and told The Rhino who I was.

Did you really think
father would not recognize

actions of his own son?

An assassin who uses
all the methods

of animals of the jungle?

You, of all people,
should recognize and appreciate

the beauty of the trap I set.

[SCOFFS]

The Rhino was coming for you.

You weren't strong enough to
fight him off by yourself, huh?

Exactly.

But my son,
my real son, Kraven...

[LAUGHS SOFTLY]

...no one is stronger.

And I knew you would not
go after him for me.

So, I sent him after you.

Some trap.

[EXHALES]

I mean, Dmitri could have died,

but that's the price
of doing business, right?

No, no, no, no, no.

Because I know you would not
let anything happen

to our precious Dmitri.

SERGEI:
Hmm.

Our empire is secure.

So, what now?

Papa, do we...

...forget about the past?

Imagine a future together?

As family.

[SIGHS]

Sergei.

Where are you going?

I could have come for you,

years ago,

but I didn't.

After everything you'd done,

all the pain
you put in the world...

...you were my father.

I still am.

Sit.

"Never fear death."

Isn't that what you taught me?

-[SCATTERED APPLAUSE]
-SERGEI: Happy Birthday, Dima.

It is a happy birthday.

First one in a long time.

And that's thanks
to you, Sergei.

Ah, come on.

-Or Kraven, should I say.
-Nah.

What do I call you now?
Mr. Kraven?

-You know who I am.
-I know you.

That was, um... hell,

what I went through.

But it also freed me.

U-Um, I feel almost born again.

[SHORT LAUGH]

I found a doctor in New York.

A little unorthodox,
I must admit.

Mm-hmm.

But he really helped me.

I mean...

changed me.

How so?

Hang on a sec.

Huh?

-[WHISPERING]
-Mm-hmm.

[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

Since when did you have friends
in the bratva, huh?

Well, I have business

-with lots of people.
-Business?

I thought you said you were
gonna sell Papa's assets

and get out of the business.

-I changed my mind.
-Dima, I didn't pull your a*s

out of the fire so you can
become a man like our father.

Are you serious?

You put my a*s in that fire.

You're a man
just like our father.

No, I'm nothing like him.
I have a code.

-And you're different than him?
-I'm better than him.

You're... [CHUCKLES]
You're not better than him.

You're worse.

How did Papa die again?

[SERGEI BREATHES DEEPLY]

A hunting accident, was it?

Don't lie to me.

You think you have
some kind of honor, huh?

Some kind of code?

Bullshit.

You're just another man
hunting for a trophy.

SERGEI:
Hey.

Dmitri.

[SCOFFS]

[SERGEI'S VOICE] You should
see the look on your face.

Hey.

Dmitri.

DMITRI: [NORMAL VOICE]
You know me.

I've always been a chameleon.

It's the one thing
I was ever good at.

Who is this doctor?
What did he do to you?

You want me to be weak,
so that you can be strong.

But I'm strong now.

I can be whoever I want to be.

The Rhino is gone. Dad is gone.

It's all just there,
for the taking.

I'm gonna take it.

You know I can't
let you do that.

Go home, Kraven.

Dad left you something.
