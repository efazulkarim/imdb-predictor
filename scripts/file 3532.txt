Geostorm By Dean Devlin 
Page 1/54
Everyone was warned 
but no one listened. 
A rise in temperature... 
ocean patterns changed... 
and ice caps melted. 
They called it extreme weather. They didn't know what 
"extreme" was. 
In the year of 2019... 
hurricanes... 
tornadoes... 
floods... 
and droughts... 
unleashed a wave of destruction upon our planet. 
We didn't just lose towns... 
or beachfronts. 
We lost entire cities. 
The East River swallowed 
Lower Manhattan. 
A heatwave killed 
2 million people in Madrid... 
in just one day. 
But in that moment... 
facing our own extinction... 
it became clear 
that no single nation 
could solve this problem alone. The world came together as one. And we fought back. 
Scientists from 17 countries... led by the U.S. and China... 
worked tirelessly... 
not as representatives 
of their nations... 
but of humanity. 
They found a way 
to neutralize the storms... 
with a net of 
thousands of satellites... 
each deploying countermeasures... designed to impact the 
basic elements of weather... 
heat, pressure, and water. 
Page 2/54
All overseen by the 
International Space Station. 
They gave the satellite net 
a technical name... 
put we all came 
to call it "Dutch Boy"... 
after the story of the child... who plugged a dam 
with his finger. 
This is what saved us all. 
It was built by a team 
led by one man... 
my father. 
- Thanks, boss. 
- Keep the change. 
Uh, Jake Lawson. I have a... 
Senate hearing, room 12. 
Yeah. 
Lawson? 
- You're the Dutch Boy guy, right? - Yeah. 
Man, I need to shake your hand. Oh, okay. 
Tornado. Zap. 
Blizzard. Zap. 
Monsoon? 
- Zap? 
- Zap! 
Everybody down here owes you, 
Jake Lawson. 
If you need anything, 
you just ask. 
The Senate Committee assigned 
to oversee Dutch Boy... 
will now hear from Jacob Lawson, Climate ISS, 
Chief Operations Coordinator. 
May the record reflect that 
he was nearly one hour late. 
Yeah, sorry 'bout that, uh. 
I literally had to fly in 
from outer space. 
Oh, here we go. 
Mr. Lawson, we find ourselves 
Page 3/54
heading toward a crossroads. 
As you know, 
as per UN Resolution 28-14, 
the United States will be 
handing over control of Dutch Boy to an international oversight 
committee in three years. 
This in spite of the fact that we actually built the thing. 
Uh, excuse me, Senator, 
I-I don't wanna slow things down. It's just the you said, "we" built it? Yes, indeed I did. 
Because I know what I did. 
I'm the guy that led the team 
that built the station. 
I was up there with a 
international crew of 600 people... not just Americans. 
And I know all of their faces, but... I don't remember yours. 
We had a-a plumber up there. 
He looked a little like you. 
Very clever, Mr. Lawson. 
Yes, Dutch Boy was 
an international effort. 
And yes, it may one day, 
very well belong to the world. But until it does, we have 
authority over its operation. 
And we have authority over you. And you have been 
flouting that authority. 
I-I have report after report here. "Failure to follow procedures". Numerous violations 
of the chain of command. 
And then, there was the 
incident where you punched 
a federal inspector in the face. Well, your federal inspector 
doesn't know 
that a capacitor holds a charge even when it's disconnected. 
Page 4/54
He was grabbing for the damn thing. I saved his life. 
You can make all the 
excuses you want, Mr. Lawson. 
But there's one thing 
you cannot defend. 
And that would be the day 
you brought Dutch Boy online 
and operational without our consent. And what would that 
have taken, Senator? 
There were a series 
of storms building 
in Southeast Asia 
and the North Atlantic 
that would have killed 
tens of thousands of people. 
Dutch Boy was ready. 
We went green. 
It works. You're welcome. 
Mr. Lawson, if you continue 
to defy our authority, 
Dutch Boy will go on 
without you! 
Am I making myself clear? 
Yes. 
Good. 
Oh, and one more thing. 
To ensure compliance, 
this committee will be sending up new support staff. 
Naturally, when they get up there, you'll have to send some of 
your people home. 
We'll leave those choices up to you. Senator, respectfully, 
my crew didn't do 
anything wrong. 
Excuse me, 
I'm not asking for your input. These people left their homes, and their families, 
and risked their lives... 
- to save this planet. 
Page 5/54
- This hearing is adjourned. 
I'm not cutting a single one 
of those people loose! 
Excuse me? 
People like you need people 
like me. You know why? 
So you can take credit 
for everything we accomplish. 
So you can go to your constituents - and your cronies. 
- This meeting is adjourned. 
And your mistresses. 
And pump out your chest 
- and say, "Hey, look at me!" 
- Sit down, please! 
- Well, I'm looking, Senator. 
- Excuse me. 
- We're all looking. 
- This meeting is adjourned. 
This meeting is adjourned! 
Thank you. 
That was going well, huh? 
Up to a point. 
No, Jake, that didn't go well 
at any point. 
But hey, what are you good at, little brother, huh? 
Like workin' the angles, 
smoothin' ruffled feathers. 
You can fix it. 
You always do. 
It's like a talent. 
It is a talent. 
Of a sort. 
I wish I could help you, 
I really do. 
But it's not that simple. 
Not this time. 
Why not? 
Well, as of last week, 
they have put me 
in charge of Dutch Boy. 
But that's great! 
That's great! 
Page 6/54
You kidding me? 
You're kidding me. 
Look, what do you 
want me to do, huh? 
You leave me no choice. 
I told you. 
This had to go well, 
and it didn't. 
Look, I-I'm sorry, Jake. 
You're fired. 
Jesus. It's over 120 
in this mother. 
Fan out. 
Uh, Agent Wilson. 
Assistant Secretary Lawson. 
You look nice today. 
I'm wearing the 
same thing I always wear. 
Ah, exactly. 
Have you seen I uh, 
got on a new tie? 
I observed. 
We're trained to notice any 
disturbing details. 
Sarah, come on, 
can we just drop... 
Assistant Secretary Lawson. 
I'm not permitted to engage in casual conversation 
while I'm at a post. 
We are being watched. 
We're always being watched. 
Well, if we're 
always being watched 
then what's the 
point of hiding anything? 
You're interfering with my duties. I'd rather not shoot you. 
Well, it would be an honor 
to be the first person 
that you kill. 
Damn it. 
What is it. 
Uh, the President's 
Page 7/54
called a security briefing. 
It was not on the schedule, so. I guess I'm now on duty. 
I like the tie. 
Home by 7. Love you. 
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. I didn't say anything. 
Move along, sir. 
Yes, ma'am. 
What the hell happened here? 
One of our thermospheric 
satellites 
malfunctioned over Afghanistan. A UN recon team found it, 
Mr. President. 
And the members of the 
Climate Council, they're aware? Yes, and they've all agreed 
to keep the incident discreet. But with this many people 
in the loop, 
I'm not sure how long 
it's gonna keep. 
And we're sure this was 
caused by Dutch Boy? 
Absolutely. 
Can we assume that 
this is an isolated incident? 
Doctor Quigley? 
We're fairly certain, yes. 
It's great to know 
that you're "fairly certain". 
This is a serious malfunction. So, your proposal is what? 
Simple. We shut down 
all Central Asian satellites 
until we know what went wrong. - Are you serious? 
- Yes, I'm serious. 
Do you know how difficult it was to get every one of these 
nations online for this? 
We have worked extremely hard 
to assure these nations 
Page 8/54
that this system will protect them. And it has. 
And let's not forget, people, 
it's an election year. 
We shut Dutch Boy down, 
the press is gonna jump all over this. Oh, my God. 
300 people died in that village. Who gives a damn 
about the politics of it all? 
We cost those people their lives. The only thing we 
should be concerned 
about here is how to fix it and making sure it never happens again. And how do you propose 
we do that? 
We can't do anything. 
What I mean is, the problem 
is not gonna be solved in this room and well, certainly not by us. We need an international team 
on the station itself. 
Not suits. 
Engineers, coders, builders, 
doing a comprehensive 
systems check. 
No matter the cost, 
no matter the politics. 
We need them up there now. 
We are set to transfer 
full authority for Dutch Boy 
to the international 
community in two weeks. 
I will not be the President 
that hands over damaged goods. Not now, not ever. 
So, we are gonna handle this 
problem and its solution in-house. And we are gonna send up one man. One of our own 
who reports only to us 
and that we can control. 
Understood? 
Page 9/54
So, find me that someone. 
Now. 
Yes, sir. 
Look, I know you're 
not gonna like it 
but as I see it, 
there's only one person 
to go after for this. 
Your brother, Jake. 
Come on, not Jake, please. 
17 countries, hmm? 
17 countries had teams 
workin' on Dutch Boy. 
They all reported to him. 
Nobody knows what's under 
the hood better than him. 
Can we weigh other options? 
Max, how long have you known me? Ever since I was transferred 
to the State Department. 
That's right. 
I handpicked you. 
I believed in you. 
You're smart. 
And I was right about you. 
I'm right about Jake. 
If this is gonna be a problem... No, sir. 
Good. 
Afghan satellite zero-niner-six inbound. 
All crews prepare for 
incoming Afghanistan satellite. Replacement satellite 
standing by. 
Afghan sat is locked in. 
Replacement cleared for launch. And away on sat 5-A. 
Airlock doors secured. 
I want a full dissection 
of all components. 
Priority one. 
Afghan satellite dissection commencing. I will take care of this. 
Page 10/54

Make sure they depressurize 
the fuel intake. 
Yeah, we got it. 
Makmoud. Oi, Makmoud! 
I'm about to obliterate 
your top score here, pal. 
I have to do some reprogramming. Oh, come on! 
He's got no pride 
of ownership, that lad. 
Please stand clear of the doors. Please stand clear of the doors. No, no, no! 
Uncle Max? 
Hey! What you doin' up there? 
What is that, a solar generator? Dual-access, sun-tracking 
solar generator. 
Replacing the power converter. Oh, God. 
Being more like 
your dad every day. 
Hey, where'd he find that? 
You seriously asking that question? No, of course. 
He made it, right? 
Come here, you. 
Ah, it's good to see you! 
How you doin'? 
You okay? 
I'm really great. 
Okay, what's goin' on here? 
All right, this is 
freakin' me out. 
You're supposed to 
be nine years old. 
Thirteen. 
You were supposed 
to be part of my life. 
But shit happens. 
Ouch. 
So, what's goin' on here? 
You living with him? 
He gets me two weekends a month. Page 11/54

Oh, good. 
Uh, how's your mom? 
Mmm, justifiably pissed. 
Yeah, I bet. 
Hannah, it's time. 
What's up, Jake? 
Hannah, I thought I told you 
not to talk to strangers. 
Come on, don't listen to him. 
Your dad and I were your age, 
we were so close, 
we had our own secret code. 
- It's true. 
- Really? 
I don't remember that. 
Yeah, you do. 
No, I don't. 
Well, it was nice seeing you. 
Hey, look. 
You take care. 
What's with all the car parts? I build electric motors for 
the retirees down at Vero Beach. Keeps me busy. 
Seems hardly worth your talent. You kidding? 
The time of my life. 
It's a little early, 
don't you think? 
I got fired by my own brother. Then I lost my family. 
My house, my dog, so. 
Happy hour starts 
around 11 out here. 
Okay, saw your niece, 
you don't want a beer. 
Road's that way. 
There's somethin' wrong 
with Dutch Boy. 
No, there isn't. 
Well, an entire village of dead Afghans may disagree with you. And then yesterday, an airlock just just opened by itself. 
Page 12/54
We lost one of our crew. 
Dutch Boy is not my problem anymore. That, I am calling bullshit on. 'Cause other than you daughter 
and your precious soccer club, Dutch Boy was all you 
ever gave a damn about. 
Oh, yeah, once. 
Yeah, but you took care of that. You don't care? 
No? 
Well then, what are you 
doin' livin' out here? 
Hmm? 
Look, I know you 
think I'm a weasel. 
Someone who just moves pieces 
around a chess board for a living. Well, guess what? 
Yeah, yeah, I am. 
But that is how you 
get 17 countries 
to agree to build 
a space station. 
Now, you. 
You build things. 
And there's something wrong 
with the thing that you built. And people are dying. 
If you really think you're the best, which I know that you do, 
then how the hell can you 
stand there and say no? 
I'll be taking orders 
from someone, I suppose? 
Yeah. 
So what, is that a yes? 
Long as it's not you. 
Yeah. 
Hey, this is Max. 
Leave a message. 
You got any room in there for me? Okay. 
I think this is everything. 
Page 13/54
I made you a 
packed lunch as well. 
Did you hear about the gas main explosions in Hong Kong? 
Yeah, it just hit the news. 
It's terrible. 
Was it anything like 
what happened in Afghanistan? 
Nothing happened in Afghanistan. Are you going back up to space? - No. 
- Yes, you are! 
You're leaving today 
to fix Dutch Boy. 
What did I tell you 
about eavesdropping? 
You never told me anything 
about eavesdropping. 
You don't really 
do much parenting. 
How do you know it's safe? 
Of course, it's safe. I've been up there a hundred times. 
Don't treat me like I'm a child. Someone died! 
- It was an accident. 
- Someone got sucked out. 
It was an accident. 
See, that's what I'm going 
up there to fix, okay? 
You don't have to worry. 
Think of it like I'm going on 
a vacation for a week or two. 
To a place 250 miles straight up? And negative 450 degrees? 
Some holiday. 
Yeah, you got a point. 
Why'd Uncle Max fire you? 
Unbelievable! 
Did you do something wrong? 
No, look, your Uncle Max 
and me, it's... 
It's not just about the one job. Sometimes, younger brothers 
Page 14/54

resent being younger. 
So they get bossy. 
They think they know everything. They tell you how to act, 
how to talk, and... 
after a couple of decades, you just get tired of 
listening to it. 
Maybe you should listen. 
My lift is here. 
- Gotta go. 
- What? 
Wait, I thought I was 
taking you to the airport? 
You really wanna 
see Mom? Great. 
We can all fly home 
to Atlanta together. 
I got it covered. 
Quit acting like you're mad. 
Hannah, what do you 
want from me? 
I want you to come back alive. And you're not exactly 
the reliable type. 
Hey. 
I know I haven't always made 
good on my promises, 
but I'm coming back! 
- I... 
- Promise. 
I promise. 
Come here. 
I'll be back soon, okay? 
OV-104 is now at T-minus one hour, and ready for boarding. 
We're at T-minus 
one minute and counting. 
Have a safe trip, sir. 
Booster rocket 
separation confirmed. 
Hate to interrupt, Major Tom... but in a few seconds, 
you should be able to see the net. Page 15/54

How does it feel 
to be back home? 
Look at you, girl. 
Livin' and breathin' 
Mr. Lawson. 
Hey. 
Ute Fassbinder. 
Nice to meet you. 
Yeah, I remember you. 
Yeah, you were the 
German scientist. 
You were here when I was here. 
Thermospherics, right? 
Yah. 
The containment shell needs 
a fresh coat of sealant, 
where the APT ducts pressure 
the channel housing. 
Not good. That's wrong. 
And you hear that? 
- I'm sorry. 
- Shh, listen. 
That one-way hum? 
That's a bad step down transformer. All these things, they have 
to be watched, cared for. 
- Mr. Lawson. 
- No, I know, I know it's not your fault. But when I left, 
everything here was perfect. 
So, maybe I need to 
speak to your chief scientist 
about the fine art of 
giving a shit. 
I'm the Chief Scientist. 
I've been promoted a year ago. 
Well, congratulations. 
One of our crew died 
this week, Mr. Lawson. 
Sorry about the transformer. 
Let me introduce you to your team. Oh, of course, an American. 
Actually, my brother and I were born in the UK, but thank you. 
Page 16/54
Yeah, but you got 
the old Stars and... 
Stripes on your arm there and... cowboy look in your eye. 
Oh, no offence, 
it's just a serious situation and the last thing we need is some Washington douche to come 
supervise us, do we lads? 
Well, you got one, so. 
How about we start with 
names and positions. 
Mm-hmm. 
Adisa, structural. 
Duncan Taylor, 
systems and OS analyst 
and loyal British subject. 
Hernandez, robotics. 
Dussette? 
Satcom and security. 
And you are? 
This is Mr. Jake Lawson. 
You're Jake Lawson? 
The Jake Lawson? 
Y-You look much older 
than I would've thought. 
I-I mean, you look good, but 
y-your physical appearance is not does not match the-the amount 
of time that has elapsed 
in your life. 
Am I getting fired? 
Okay, we don't have a lot of time. So, we have three 
situations to examine. 
Afghanistan, the scientist 
that died here, 
and the new incident in Hong Kong. Hong Kong? No, that was 
that was a gas main explosion. We all watched that on the telly. All right, okay, you 
just keep believing that. 
I, on the other hand, 
Page 17/54
have a mystery 
that I'd like to solve 
and prevent more deaths, so. 
Feel free to join me. 
Or not. 
All right, quick question. 
Okay, active shooter. 
The President and I 
are both in the line of fire. 
Who do you save first? 
Me... 
The President. 
Come on, you could take a second just to think about that. 
Sorry, baby. 
Job comes first. 
Same with you. 
No, that's not true. 
No, I have priorities, 
and you... 
you are my priority. 
Come on, let's do it. 
I kinda want to, but um... 
you just keep talkin'. 
And why do we always 
have to be sneakin' around? 
Come on, let's do it. 
Let's get married. 
We can't. 
It's against the rules. 
One day, baby. 
Um, you're gonna get that. 
Because your job comes first. 
No... 
I'm gonna get it 'cause I don't want it to interfere with this. See? 
Now, I might just not save you. Yeah, hello? 
Max, it's Cheng. 
Cheng, God, 
tell me you're not in Hong Kong. - Cheng? 
- Last night... 
Page 18/54
I was right in the middle of it. It was horrible. 
That's why I'm calling. 
Phone service just came back on. Yeah, well, you're lucky to be alive. I mean those gas pipes? 
I'm not so sure 
that was the cause. 
What you you mean? 
I-I don't follow. 
It was abnormally hot 
before the pipes blew. 
The satellite sensors 
should've recorded it, right? 
I checked over a dozen times 
but I can't get access to 
Dutch Boy's Hong Kong satellite. My access has been blocked. 
Check your holoframe. 
I don't understand. 
We both have clearance. 
Exactly. 
And the only people that 
have the authority to block it are in the building you work in. Wait. 
What do you mean? 
If someone is covering up 
a system defect, 
there's potential for critical failure on a global scale. 
If Dutch Boy has 
a catastrophic failure, 
it can create 
something far worse 
than what we're 
trying to prevent. 
What we call a geostorm. 
Uh, what, slow down, Cheng. 
All right? A what? 
A geostorm. 
Simultaneous 
catastrophic weather 
events triggered all 
Page 19/54
over the globe. 
Once they pass 
the minimum threshold, 
the storms will start 
causing new storms. 
Like a chain reaction 
until they merge together. 
It's gotta be a glitch. 
I'll give you a call 
when I know something. 
All right. Thanks. 
These pipes have not been 
well-maintained or upgraded in years. Cheng thinks Hong Kong had 
something to do with Dutch Boy. He's implying some kind of cover-up. I just got a text and POTUS 
called a last-minute press briefing. What, you can't stay? 
Oh, when duty calls, duty calls. "Neither rain nor snow 
nor gloom of night", right. 
Honey, that's the Postal Service. We're the Secret Service. 
Secret Service. 
Oh, there's a difference? 
Really? 
I didn't know that. 
Grab his laptop. 
Let's go. 
So, the satellite that 
went rogue over Afghanistan, 
what type was that? 
That's my fave, actually. 
I call it a "RocknRolla". 
Ah, the SR-22. 
Uses sonic waves to 
slow molecular movement 
causing cooling. 
But in that case, 
freezing. Why? 
We don't know. We checked 
the satellite's hard drives 
but the logs were wiped clean 
Page 20/54
by the malfunction. 
All right. Let's pull up every RocknRolla satellite we have 
to see if we can find 
any corruption in their logs. 
Pull up every 
RocknRolla in the net. 
There's gotta be more 
than a thousand of them. 
Ah, 1,270, to be exact. 
And we're gonna scan 
each and every one of them. 
Dana. Hey. 
Hey, what are you doing here? 
What do you mean, 
what am I doing here? I... 
I work here. 
I'm your boss. 
Yeah, but what are you 
doing down from Mt. Olympus 
and visiting me in Millennial Village? Well, I have 
I have a favor to ask you. 
You're the best at what you do. I need you to 
keep this between us. 
Okay. 
I have a problem 
with my holoframe. 
Do I look like a 
Genius Bar to you? 
I'm sorry. I'm sitting here 
defending the free world 
against state operators 
and cyber terrorists 
but grandpa needs 
a fix in his phone. 
No, but I have a 
problem trying to 
get through to satellite 
G-22 over Hong Kong. 
So a satellite has 
a bad com, that happens. 
No, no not a satellite. 
Page 21/54
All of them. 
Oh. 
I am mildly intrigued. 
Stay. 
Okay. 
Looks like Vanilla 
line disruption... 
bad server relay or 
trunc failure or something. 
You still dating that 
Secret Service chick? 
What? No. 
No, I'm not dating anyone. 
Mm-hmm. 
Wait, look. Oh, my God. 
Someone wanted to block 
your access without you 
knowing that it was intentional. But this... 
This is very intentional, 
and it's very clever. 
And I know 
what you're gonna say. 
You're gonna say, 'tell no one', and I won't. 
But I didn't sign up to work here so I could cubicle squat 24-7. So, whatever is going on, 
I want in on the action. 
Well, then let's hope 
there isn't any action. 
And yeah... 
Tell no one. 
Miss Fassbinder, 
we've just been given a 
priority communication request. From Climate Command? 
From the White House. 
All right so, who are the 
yahoos in Washington 
we're gonna deal with on this? I guess I would be 
the head yahoo. 
Hello, guys. 
Page 22/54
Max tells me you don't have 
a high opinion of politicians 
I didn't say... that. 
Well, neither do I. 
We went through hell 
getting the world 
on board with this program. 
We've come too far 
for it to fail. 
You and I both understand 
why we cannot let that happen. Yes, sir. 
So, if I find anything, 
I'll report to you right away. Actually, you'll be 
reporting to Max here. 
Good luck. 
Have at it. 
Thank you, sir. 
I'll leave you two alone. If you need me, I'll be in my office. Thank you. 
I'll be reporting to you? 
You lied to me. 
Again. 
No, I just didn't answer 
your ridiculous demand. 
How do I switch this thing off? There's something you need to know. We've been having 
issues down here 
accessing the Dutch Boy satcom. We have reason to believe that... Well, it may not be accidental. Might not be accidental? 
I've been trying to access 
the Hong Kong satellite. 
I knew it. 
I knew it! 
You think it's possible? 
Yeah, it's possible. 
But even if you could access 
the Hong Kong satellite remotely, you're not gonna 
Page 23/54

get the logs you need. 
No. We gotta pull 
that information 
from the actual 
satellite up here. 
Okay, I can authorize that. 
I don't need your 
authorization for anything. 
I'm sure that's 
really scary for you. 
But how about 
you just count on me 
to do my job 
and say 'thank you'? 
Oh, count on you. 
Remember the first time 
I had to bail you out? 
Oh, God, Jesus Christ. 
Yeah, just one week 
after Mom and Dad died, 
you got arrested 
for fighting, hmm? 
That's when I 
realized that despite 
everything I was going through, I was gonna have to be 
responsible for you. 
All right, you know what? 
Fine. It is what it is. 
I guess I got no choice 
but to count on you. 
But if you ever authorize 
anything without my approval, 
you're gonna be on 
the next shuttle home. 
Transmission ended. 
Hong Kong satellite 022 
inbound for examination. 
All right. 
Let's take this thing apart, 
find out what 
happened in Hong Kong. 
Bring it down. 
It should've come down by now. Page 24/54

What is that? 
I have no idea. 
- All right, shut it down. 
- It's not responding. 
Jesus, Hernandez! 
Get down! 
Get outta here! Go! 
Somebody, open this door now! 
Watch out! 
Shit! 
I'd like to pick up every 
single piece of this thing 
and get it down to manufacturing. Think we can retrieve the logs from the hard drives? 
Well, the accident 
created an electrical 
short and fried all the drives. I mean, look at it. 
It's toast. 
So, we've lost all the drives 
with possible corruption? 
Not all of them. 
What do you mean? 
I was reviewing a video from the accident that killed Makmoud. 
Each of the panels that blew 
has a drive inside. 
And one of them got stuck 
in the communication tower. 
Looks like the seal locks 
are still intact. 
We're lucky. The corrupted 
drive could still be inside. 
We gotta get that panel back. 
Yeah, hello? 
I just got into D.C. 
We have to meet. 
I figured it all out. 
Meet me at 10: 
at the place across the square where we used to have lunch 
back in college. 
Page 25/54
All right, yeah. 
I'll be there. 
Ready to decompress. 
All right. Doors open, kids. 
You're clear to exit. 
Step across the gravity threshold and follow me. 
Let's just get the panel, 
see what's on those drives. 
Okay. 
There's the panel. 
Wait. Hold up. 
We designed the tower to have 
the emergency derig ports 
so the bars can be moved easily. Control, the panel is secured. Roger that. 
Come back now, kids, come back. We're on our way back. 
Jake, what's happening? 
I don't know! 
Jake? Jake! 
I can't control that damn suit! - What's going on? What's going on? - His suit's malfunctioning. 
- Jake, do you read me? 
- Duncan, tell him to cut it. 
Jake, cut off the fuel intake. It's not responding! 
Hang on, Jake. 
I can't hold it! 
Eject the pack. 
Eject the pack! 
Oh, Christ, we're gonna lose him! We're gonna lose him! 
Are you all right? 
Yeah. 
You got the drive? 
I grabbed it 
when I freed the panel. 
You smashed up a dozen 
comlinks, TCAS sensors... 
I'm fine. Thank you very much. What happened out there? 
Page 26/54
Propulsion throttle locked up. And you lost the door panel 
which means 
no drive codes. 
Back to square one. 
Great. 
Why didn't you tell them 
about the drive? 
Because someone 
just tried to kill me. 
I know my crew. 
I trust them. 
You think you know them. 
But someone doesn't want us 
to see what's on this drive. 
Jake, there's 
no corruption here at all. 
The doors weren't 
accidentally blown off. 
They were programmed to. 
- This wasn't a malfunction. 
- No. 
Someone intentionally killed Makmoud. No doubt the same person 
that tampered with 
the Hong Kong satellite. 
The user log ins 
have been wiped clean. 
We have no digital fingerprints. No. That's what they think. 
Log in records are synched 
back to the mainframe. 
Yeah, but that's the problem. 
If they're deleted in one place, they're deleted everywhere. 
No, everywhere they know about. When we built Dutch Boy, 
we put in a-a locked off library. Something that would track 
and archive everything. 
Our saboteur's log in info 
is gonna be in there. 
No. 
You've been locked out. 
Page 27/54
But by who? 
The virtual conference room. 
How many have access 
to those transmissions? 
Anyone with level three access and above. 
Dozens of people. 
Max. 
- Max. 
- What? 
Relax. 
He'll be here soon. 
What, really? I-I seem nervous? Just a little. 
He's here. 
He's here? 
No! No! 
Cheng! Oh, God! 
No! 
This is Agent Wilson. 
Yes, I need an 
ambulance right now! 
- Dupont Circle. 
- Max... 
Agent Wilson, 
I'm dispatching the ambulance. You got me. You got me. 
I'm here, look at me. 
Look at me. 
Zeus... 
Z-Zeus... 
What? 
Virtual conference initiating. Max? You okay? 
They said it was urgent. 
What is it? 
Yeah, uh. 
I wanted to... apologize. 
Apologize? 
If you had any idea 
what I just walked away from... You gotta drag me up here 
just to apologize? 
All right, fine. 
Page 28/54

Apology accepted. 
Hey, Max, we don't walk out 
on each other. 
That's the unspoken code 
between brothers. 
You remember that day 
Dad took us fishing? 
Yeah, he dropped his 
cellphone in Key Biscayne. 
Proof the Lawsons aren't fishermen. Four hours... 
the three of us didn't catch a thing. I tried to sabotage Dad's reel so we could leave. 
That pin, the highest 
part of the spool, 
pulled it, so the level 
mechanism would pop out. 
Of course, Dad was a government spy his whole life. 
Caught me red-handed. 
"Trust me," he said. 
I get it. 
"No one likes to fail. 
"But I'd rather not 
catch fish with my family... 
than catch 20 fish alone". 
I didn't even understand 
what he meant back then. 
But I do now. 
Take care, Max. 
End transmission. 
Transmission ended. 
What was all that? 
That was the first decent 
conversation we've had in years. Oh! Oh, my God! 
Would you relax? 
What? 
Do you have a moment? 
Yes! I do, I got your message. Jesus. 
What happened? 
Did Secret Service Barbie dump you? Page 29/54

I-I need to show you something. Take a look at this. 
You remember that day 
Dad took us fishing? 
He dropped his 
cellphone in Key Biscayne. 
Our dad never took us fishing. Oh. 
That's sad. 
Oh, I'm sorry. 
I'm not good at the, like, 
talk about your daddy issues 
kinda friend thing, I just... 
What? No. 
No, no, no. 
It's a code. 
"He dropped his cellphone 
in Key Biscayne". 
His cellphone number is the key. Take a look at the digits. 
Okay, you got your first number, that's your first word. 
Second number, nine. 
You move on nine words. 
- That's your second word. 
- Mm-hmm. 
Third number, nine again. 
Another nine, you move on. 
Then nine, then two, then nine, then five, so on, and so on, 
until you get an entirely 
different message. 
So, who came up with 
this encryption, a 12-year-old? No. I was 13. 
Okay. 
So, one, nine, nine, nine, 
two, nine, five, 
five, eight, seven, one. And go. Proof of sabotage at the 
highest level of government. 
Trust no one. 
Well, you said you were 
looking for action. 
Page 30/54

Yeah, but I mean, holy shit. 
If you don't wanna take 
this any further, I understand. Oh, no, no, no. 
I do, I do. It's just... 
I do and I don't. 
Kinda like going on a roller coaster or eating Chipotle. 
What's our next move? 
Okay, I need you to find 
anything you can 
on a file named Project Zeus. 
Project Zeus? 
Yeah. 
Okay. Looks like we have 
ourselves a bro-spicacy here. 
Uh, just run the damn search. 
Um... 
I am getting a hit. 
Um... 
Looks like it's double-encrypted. It's a little OCD. 
C-Can you break it? 
Yeah, I could but... 
I can't do it from here. 
File's under a White 
House security 
network and it's 
just not hackable. 
I'd have to log in and 
I don't have the credentials for it. Shit. Nor do I. 
Uh, I-I don't know anyone who does. Yeah, you do. 
Max? 
Freeze. 
Oh! Holy shit! 
Whoa, whoa, whoa, honey, relax! Who is this girl in our house? I-I can explain everything. 
Uhmm, that sounds really pervy. - Shut up. 
- Okay, I'm sorry, I will. 
I broke one of your wine glasses. Page 31/54

Um, i-it just fell and 
I promise I'm gonna reimburse you. Um, I have the money, I'm sorry. Talk. 
This is Dana. 
She works with me in State. 
Now I asked her here 
'cause I need her help. 
And uh, well, as it turns out, I need your help too. 
She's hot! 
I know how much 
your job means to you. 
I took an oath, Max. 
We have rules. 
And technically, 
you're not supposed 
to be sleeping together, either. Dana. 
You're asking me 
to commit a crime. 
You're soliciting a Secret 
Service agent 
to break into the 
White House server 
and illegally obtain files. 
And you thought I would say yes! Yeah, I still think 
you're gonna say yes. 
Why? 
Because I'm the one 
who's asking you. 
You know, and if I'm asking you, well, then it must be important. And you know that 
it's bigger than you and me. 
You and I. 
- Shut up. 
- Shut up. 
Sarah, please. 
One time. 
We need to play back 
the security cameras 
without alerting anyone. 
Page 32/54
Someone killed Makmoud. 
We find out why, 
we'll know who's behind this. 
But you can't access the cameras without being logged in. 
That's why we're going 
to the backup server room. 
See? It comes in handy 
that I built the place. 
Yes. But I live here. 
Show-off. 
Makmoud was prepping diagnostics on the Afghan sat 
while we launched a replacement. Son of a bitch. 
He pulled something off the sat. Poor bastard figured it out 
and they killed him 
to make sure no one else did. 
There are no cameras 
allowed in the locker rooms. 
Then let's go 
take a look for ourselves. 
What's the code? 
Seven, six, three, six, three. What do you think you're doing? You know what happened to me 
out there wasn't an accident. 
Whoever did that... 
killed Makmoud. 
And what makes 
you think it is not me? 
'Cause if it was you, 
I'd be dead already. 
Dussette, lower your gun. 
Whatever you're looking for 
it is not in this locker. 
I was here when Makmoud came in. He put his stuff 
in an empty one. 
Why didn't you tell me? 
You watched the same 
security footage that I did. 
I was just waiting to see 
Page 33/54
who's gonna come and 
look for Makmoud's stuff. 
It's in here. 
Two, six, six, five, three. 
Bingo. 
This is everything he copied off the satellite onto 
his holoframe. 
That's a virus. 
That wasn't generated by the 
satellite's onboard computer. 
Because they were planted. 
Makmoud found the virus, 
got killed before he could tell anyone. Oh, I got it. 
All right, here we go. 
Project Zeus. 
There are tens of thousands 
of storm simulations in here 
and each one is 
starting in a different place. They all end the same way. 
A geostorm. 
And unlike anything 
we've ever seen. 
Dana, can you-can you 
show us just uh, 
the simulation that 
begins in Afghanistan? 
Yeah, sure. 
Okay, now, now filter those 
so that the second 
malfunctions over Hong Kong. 
Where are you going with this? What if Cheng realized 
that someone was 
following one of his scenarios? Making it look like 
a predicted pattern of malfunction. Disguising a crime 
like a series of accidents. 
It might actually be 
a series of accidents. 
If it were, they 
Page 34/54
wouldn't have killed him. 
Someone has weaponized Dutch Boy. Virtual conference initiating. Hey. 
New face? 
Yeah, yeah, a friend. 
She's keepin' things 
off the monitors, chillin', 
so, we're good. 
- So, you got my message? 
- Yeah, I got your message. 
It's uh, it's worse than we thought. Whoever's doing this is using 
Dutch Boy to target cities. 
And they're disguising 
their moves as malfunctions. 
They already killed the man 
who found out about this. 
And I don't think they're done. Yeah. 
This is my life's work, Max. 
You know, they said it was impossible, but we pulled it off. 
And it worked 
perfectly, without fail 
day after day, year after year. So, what do people do with it? Turn it into a gun. 
I know. 
I know. It's not too late. 
We can fix this 
before it happens again, 
but I can't do it on my own. 
I need you. I need 
you to tell me. 
How are they 
controlling Dutch Boy? 
- I know how they're controlling it. - How? 
A virus. 
Well, could you stop it? 
There's only one way. 
We can shut down 
Dutch Boy temporarily. 
Page 35/54
The reboot will 
flush out the system, 
kill the virus, and revert back to the failsafe OS. 
Okay. Let's do it. 
Then I'm authorizing. 
Yeah, I think we've established I don't really wait for that. 
This isn't a Chromebook. 
You don't just put your 
finger on the power button. 
You need the kill codes. 
And the only one who has those is the President. 
So, let's just go to the President and tell him what we know. 
No. No. 
You can't go to Palma. 
We need way more 
proof than I have. 
We're talkin' about 
shutting down Dutch Boy. 
I mean even for an hour, 
that puts the whole planet at risk. No, I don't think you understand. Someone sealed off the 
back door into the system. 
A back door almost 
no one knew existed. 
But the President did. 
No, Jake, come on, what? 
Are you out of your mind? 
Not saying it's him. 
I'm saying what if. 
Who else has the 
resources to pull this off? 
Murder, cover-up, and a virus 
that can only be stopped 
with the codes in his pocket. 
Why? Huh, tell me. Why? 
Why would he do that? 
We're two weeks away 
from transferring Dutch Boy 
to the rest of the world. 
Page 36/54
Two weeks away from 
losing autonomous control. 
Now, he talks a good game, 
but he's never gonna let it happen. A series of disasters, an 
international crew to take the fall. And you'd have to 
cancel the hand-off. 
And who would blame him? 
All right. You stay on top 
of your satellites. 
Max. 
Hey, Max, 
don't do anything stupid. 
Let's go. 
Yeah, they already 
tried to kill me once. 
Max! 
Transmission ended. 
President Palma. 
Some questions please, sir. 
Comments before heading to the national convention 
in Orlando, sir? 
Mr. President, 
is there any statement? 
A moment before 
you head to Orlando. 
My friends from Washington, D.C., I could never get off the plane without first saying 
hello to you. 
Impossible. 
What are you doing here? 
- Are you insane? 
- Sarah, look. 
Jake needs us to steal 
the kill codes from Palma. 
Us? 
You're asking me to help you 
on the word 
of your asshole brother 
who you haven't even 
spoken to in three years! 
Page 37/54
Yeah. 
Think about it, Afghanistan, 
Hong Kong, 
Cheng, the-the crazy sim shit, the death on the 
space station, come on? 
Look, you gotta trust me on this. All right? 
I'm not kidding around here. 
- Okay. 
- Look. 
The codes are on 
Palma's holoframe. 
We can't do it on the plane. 
Why not? 
Too many eyes. 
He's never alone. 
All right, then 
then what's the play? 
Palma likes some private time 
to shower and make calls 
before the after parties. 
You follow, I'll get you inside. I can steal the codes 
while he's in the shower. 
- That's the idea. 
- Yes, it is. 
- Warning. 
- Out of my... 
All satellite communication 
offline. 
All satellite communication 
offline. 
Report to stations immediately. Oh, my God. 
We have nearly 200 satellites 
reporting malfunctions. 
Most of them nearing critical. Pull up the satellite 
closest to critical overload. 
We've lost all control 
of the Tokyo satellite. 
Max. 
I didn't know you were 
Page 38/54
coming to the convemtion. 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, 
my dad lives in Florida, so uh. I promised I'd get him in 
to the convention. 
We need every vote, right? 
Yeah, bring him to 
the green room. 
We'll uh, do a little photo op. Aw, that's very kind of you, sir. Thank you. 
We've got reports of 
extreme weather anomalies 
building over Brazil, Mexico, 
Bucharest, and Belgrade. 
There's over a thousand storm 
warnings issued around the world. Rio de Janeiro satellite, critical. Retrieval routine offline. 
Chart a new course. 
Get us close to the 
nearest satellite going critical. What are you trying to do? 
We're gonna launch 
the replacements. 
As many as we can. 
- Wait, wait, wait... 
- As fast as we can. 
We have to retrieve 
the other satellites first. 
All of the replacements 
will crash into them. 
They're programmed to arrive 
in the exact same destination. And they'll knock out 
the infected satellites. 
- Yeah. 
- Of course! 
All crews report to stations 
for Rio satellite replacement. Go for launch. 
Away, she goes. 
Satellite replacement for Rio 
on its way. 
Page 39/54
Warning: 
collision course. 
Stable the retro boosters. 
Don't let it slow down. 
Load 'em up! 
Keep 'em comin'! 
Warning: 
Time to geostorm: 
One hour, 30 minutes. 
Four more years! 
Thank you. 
As you know, the environment 
was my late wife's 
great passion and purpose. 
And I know that she 
would be extremely proud... 
caused by the worst 
hailstorm in recorded history. There has been another 
extreme weather event, 
this time in Rio de Janeiro. 
An off shore cold front 
blew rapidly across land 
plunging the city into 
dangerously low temperatures. 
There are reports of 
numerous casualties, but 
we don't know 
how many at this time. 
We're also hearing 
that a cargo plane 
may have crashed 
in the city itself 
possibly related 
to the freezing cold. 
Tokyo and now Rio are the first catastrophic weather events 
since the launch of Dutch Boy. Stay tuned after the break 
when we're joined by 
our reporter, Sally Jones. 
Oh, God. 
Page 40/54
Hey, Max! 
Where's your daddy? 
Oh... 
Uh, you know what, 
he got so caught 
up in all the excitement, I-I... I recruited you for this position. I know everything about you. 
Your brother, 
your mother's death, 
your father's death, everything. Why'd you lie to me? 
Hmm? 
Why'd you insist 
on making this trip? 
Tell me what's wrong. 
Maybe I can help you. 
Maybe I can't. 
All right, look. 
I've gotta tell you something, come here. 
We are 90 minutes away 
from a global storm 
we won't recover from. 
And I need 
the President's kill codes. 
Come again? 
We gotta shut 
Dutch Boy down now. 
You're serious. 
You said you hired me 
because you believed in me, right? All right, well, I need you 
to believe in me now. 
Well, we've gotta brief 
the President. 
Get to Cape Canaveral. 
No, no, no, no. 
W-We can't do that, sir. 
Why not? 
I believe he's the one 
who initiated it. 
United we stand. 
United, we can. 
Page 41/54
Four more years! 
You better be goddamn 
sure of yourself 
making accusations like that. 
With all due respect, we don't have time to argue about this. Palma and I go way back. 
Why would he do that? 
That's insane. 
Yeah, well, he's doin' it. 
What's your proof? 
Yeah, I got proof. 
Dozens of files, right? 
Project Zeus. It's all there. 
Well, we can't get the 
kill codes from the President. Why not? 
'Cause the President 
is the kill codes. 
Biometrics. Ten fingerprints, 
two retina scans. 
Well, what do we do? 
I'll have to reason with him. 
We'll have to reason with him. Satellites going critical 
over Florida. 
Go to replacement sat now. 
Station self-destruct 
sequence initiated. 
Station self-destruct 
sequence initiated. 
Phase one commencing now. 
Great. Shut that down! 
I can't, I'm locked out. 
We built in back door overrides. I'm trying them! 
If we lose the station, we won't be able to control 
the satellites. 
Self-destruct? 
Why would you build 
that into the station? 
In case it fell to Earth. 
Where's Duncan? 
Page 42/54

He's the only one with 
enough programming expertise 
to override the commands. 
Duncan. 
That's the fuel tanks. 
They're the first to go. 
Then section by section 
until it can't handle retrieval. Okay, everybody 
get to the shuttles! 
Evacuate! 
Come on, we gotta hurry! 
Go, go, go! 
Jake. What are you 
still doing here? 
That felt good. 
I wanted to do that 
since I first met you. 
Have you gone mad? 
Yeah, pretty much. 
The virus? 
You're the only one who 
could've put it in the system. The only one who could've 
sealed off the back door. 
The only one who could've 
helped them pulled this off. 
I need the overrides for the 
self-destruct to the station, now! I mean, what for? 
I'm not gonna be here 
when it blows. 
But you will. 
Come on, man. 
Why did you do it? 
Well, you know what us 
lowly scientists get paid? 
Take that times a thousand. 
What difference is it gonna make? If you don't stop, there's not gonna be a planet to spend it on. Please. We're gonna 
keep all the best bits. 
Aren't you a little bit curious Page 43/54

to watch the world... 
burn? 
No. 'Cause millions 
of people are gonna die. 
One of them's my daughter. 
Oh, shit. 
Holding room for the President down on the left. 
We'll confront him there. 
Project Zeus. 
Did Cheng tell you anything else? Cheng? 
This president knows that hope is not a plan. 
This president knows... 
that despite how far we've come... there is much more work ahead. Working to save our planet... 
is my first priority as vice president. This is but a stepping stone 
for the success... 
and greatness that can and 
will be the future of our society. Excuse me. 
That's why I'm here tonight 
with the Speaker of the House... the senate pro tempore, 
and President Palma's whole cabinet. We all stand united to support... Palma doesn't leave the building. - Yes, sir. 
- Let's go. 
Where have you been? 
Come here, come here. 
It's not the President, all right? It's Dekkom. 
Dekkom? 
H-How do you know? 
Because he just tried to kill me. That's how I know. 
Look, the sim shows Orlando 
is the next city to be hit. 
Here? 
Why would he do that? 
Page 44/54
Because Dekkom wants Palma 
trapped here, all right? 
And everyone else who's 
next in line for the presidency. Are we still stealing the codes? The President is the kill codes, all right? They're biometric. 
If Palma dies, Dutch Boy 
can't be stopped. 
Sure, kidnap the President. That sounds like the reasonable move. Well, it's the only move we've got. Unless you wanna steal his 
fingers and his eyes. 
Huh? 
We go now. 
You get us a car. 
I'll get us a president. 
All right, good. 
The program did not gain 
immense international support... Gunman spotted. 
POTUS is compromised. 
Evac to secure location: Alpha. Get him out! Get him out! 
Go, go, go, go, go! 
Secret Service! 
Get back! Get back! 
You got a 20 on the shooters? 
From mezzanine by exit 212. 
Two men with automatics. 
- I'm on it. You get POTUS. 
- You two... 
Secure this entrance. 
No one come down this hallway. Nobody gets through! 
Hard room, Lammy. 
- Got it! 
- You two... 
Clear the emergency exit now! 
I'm sorry, Mr. President. 
You need to come with me. 
This exit is off limits! 
Please remain calm. 
Page 45/54
Seriously? 
A self-driving cab? 
Dana jacked it remotely. 
It was all I could get. 
What the hell's 
going on here, Lawson? 
Please, please, sir. Look, 
I'll explain everything in the car. Please, sir! 
We don't have much time! 
Keep moving! 
Get to the shuttles! 
Keep going! 
Quick! 
Time to geostorm: 55 minutes. 
Sir, I can barely hear you. 
The storm is causing 
too much static. 
The Secret Service will be 
homing in on the beacon 
on the President's holoframe. 
You gotta get to him 
before they do. 
Under no circumstances can he 
make it out of Orlando. 
Our man on the 
space station did his job. 
- Now you do yours. 
- Copy that. Got it. 
- Dekkom? 
- It's the perfect weapon, sir. All right? Dekkom is trying 
to change the map of the world. Then what? Blame it on 
a computer glitch? 
Yeah, that and a dead president. He'll take office 
after wiping out 
everyone in the 
line of succession. 
Dear God. 
- Get to cover, under the bridge! - Sir. 
You are implicating the 
Page 46/54
Secretary of State in this. 
You realize you're committing... - treason? 
- Treason. 
Oh, yeah, I kidnapped the President, I've stolen state secrets. 
Anything I'm forgetting, honey? Honey? 
Guilty. 
It took years for 
Dekkom to plan this, sir. 
President's schedule always 
changes last minute. 
This is the one day and date 
he could be sure wouldn't move. Having my brother and I 
leave the investigation 
was a setup from the start. 
Think about it. 
He hired us to fail. 
Get down! 
All right, it says we're 
back in the clear. 
We've got four minutes to 91. 
Just gotta take care 
of a little problem, first. 
Hold on! 
Woo! 
Marry her. 
No. We're fine here. 
A lightning storm in 
Orlando has caused 
a horrific explosion at the DNC. There's no official word on the whereabouts of the President... I don't know... 
I don't know. 
I just can't get in touch with Jake. We have reports now on 
explosions on the space station. Honey, the Orlando storm 
is getting really close 
to your dad's place. 
I-I can't get through to him. 
Page 47/54
Has he texted you? Or... 
He's not there. 
He's there. 
On a major issue 
on the space station. 
Attention all crews. 
Now loading final shuttle. 
Please board the designated 
evacuation shuttle immediately. Shuttle launch sequence initiating. Jake. 
- I'm not comin'. 
- What? 
When my brother 
gets those kill codes, 
someone has to be here 
to execute the program. 
No. We need to go. 
We haven't heard 
from him in hours. 
I trust him. 
You know the reboot 
has to be done manually. 
Then I stay. 
I'm the commander. 
No. 
I'm the only one my brother 
would trust with the codes, so. I need your holoframe. 
You have to insert it manually at the core of the mainframe. 
You can find it, yes? 
- Yes. 
- Good. 
Goodbye, Ute. 
Auf Wiedersehen, Jake. 
Pull over here. 
The President's beacon shows 
him heading right towards us. 
You really wanna 
drive back into that? 
Yeah, right after it passes, 
I'll be the sole survivor... 
ready to be sworn in as the 
Page 48/54
next President of the United States. Here they come. 
Fire. 
You thought the President was 
the only one who could be tracked? - How the hell did you? 
- How? 
'Cause I'm the goddamn President of the United States of America. You're done, Leonard. 
He's all yours. 
Wait, wait, wait a minute. 
I've given you an opportunity, Mr. President. 
You should take it. 
An opportunity? 
Let him go. 
It's genocide, Leonard! 
You say genocide, 
I say preemptive strike. 
You've lost your mind! 
Tomorrow, the sun will rise, 
all our enemies will be gone. 
Wiped away as if 
by the hand of God! 
Why would you do this? 
Because no one else would. 
I'm turning the clock 
back to 1945... 
when America was 
a shining city on a hill... 
not just a bank 
disguised as a country. 
By playing God? 
What the hell is Dutch Boy 
if not playing God? 
Ask Max, he knows. 
Science is all about playing God. Sometimes, 
God doesn't play so nice. 
Yeah, well, you know what 
my brother would say? 
What? 
Get him outta here. 
Page 49/54
Let's go, Lawson! 
That's my fianc. 
Get the President 
to cover. Hurry! 
Mr. President. 
We got the kill codes. 
You'll have to hurry. 
Station-controlled shut down. 
What about the crew? 
Safe. 
But Jake decided to stay. 
To reboot the satellites. 
Your brother's waitin' for you. Come on. 
Virtual conference initiating. Hey. 
Jake. 
Jake, it was Dekkom. 
Well, I did say 
I might be right. 
Mr. President. 
How's Hannah? 
Oh, she's good, she's safe. 
Atlanta wasn't hit. 
Thank God. 
Identity verified. 
Shut down protocol 
transfer initiating. 
It's gonna take 
60 seconds to upload. 
Well, how long 
till the self-destruct? 
Eight minutes. 
Give or take. 
Mr. Lawson... 
we thank you for your sacrifice. Wait. What the hell's goin' on? You've done your part, Max. 
Jake, what is goin' on? 
Now it's time for me to do mine. No, no, no. 
The kill codes don't stop 
the self-destruct, do they? 
Do they?! 
Page 50/54
No... 
only the geostorm. 
The station's self-destruct 
can't be reversed. 
Come on, come on, 
there must be a way, huh? 
Come on, it's all my fault. 
I'm the one who put you up there. Hey, it's okay. 
I wanted to go. 
It was my choice. 
God knows... 
I haven't always 
made the right ones. 
You know, you were right, 
little brother. 
I was supposed to look after you. But you looked after me. 
Can you forgive me? 
Yeah, always. 
Look after my little girl. 
Stay in her life. 
I will. 
Should've done this 
a long time ago, huh? 
Yeah. 
You're a good man, Jake. 
I'll see you, kiddo. 
Transfer complete. 
Time to geostorm: 
Five minutes, 51 seconds. 
Warning: 
has terminated. 
We don't know 
what's happening up there. 
We just know 
the station has suffered 
a devastating accident 
of some kind. 
We're being told now 
it is beyond repair or salvation. Honey. 
He's coming back. 
Page 51/54

He promised me. 
We will keep you updated 
with any new developments. 
Self-destruct 
entering phase four. 
Code invalid. 
Code invalid. 
Need a hand? 
Wrong door. 
What are you doing here? 
I told you I live here. 
Time to geostorm: 
One minute, 40 seconds. 
Uploading kill codes. 
Satellite shut down in process. When the last satellite 
cycles down, let me know. 
I'll manually reboot 
the entire system. 
- That should flush out the virus. - Okay. 
Five to go. 
Three. 
- Come on, baby. 
- Two. 
And one. 
Manual reboot activated. 
Status: 
The net is back up. 
The virus is gone. 
Transferring control 
of the net back to NASA. 
Jake! 
I've got you! 
Warning: 
entering final stage. 
Best seat in the house. 
Ute... 
Are you a believer in 
the Hail Mary? 
Follow me. 
We gotta get to the satellite. Page 52/54

I've got you. 
We gotta get away 
as far as we can 
before the final detonation. 
Dock releasing. 
And it appears we have lost 
the space station. 
A tragic ending for the 
two heroes still on board. 
Hey, Max, take a look. 
Picking up exhaust flares. 
And they're pulsing. 
In a mayday pattern. 
See if we could turn 
one of the shuttles around. 
Hopefully, someone sees us. 
Fingers crossed. 
Hernandez, you son of a bitch! Thank the Mexican. 
Yes! Come here. Yes! 
A miracle indeed. 
The shuttle you see 
is bringing home 
all the ISS crew members 
who remained on the station. 
Hi, Jake. I'm Sarah, 
Max's fiance. 
Well, welcome to the family. 
Well done, well done. 
Both of you. 
Sorry I doubted you, 
Mr. President. 
Yeah, well, 
you were wrong, Jake. 
Again. 
Well, how many times 
do I have to tell you? 
Never listen to me. 
God, it's good to have you back. Good to be back. 
It's a nice place 
you got here, Jake. 
Thank you. 
So, when you heading back up? 
Page 53/54
- In a week. 
- Yeah? 
Yeah, a lot of work left. 
But I'll be back. 
I know. 
- This sucks. 
- Yeah, seriously, this is so boring. You know what? 
I can't do this for another second. Why'd you make us 
do this in the first place? 
I don't know. 
I was tryin' to relive a moment. Moment? W-What moment? 
We never went fishing with Dad. You made that whole story up. 
Yeah, but that was 
a good story though, huh? 
You gotta admit that. 
It had a moral and everything. Moral? What moral? 
You can't undo the past. 
All you can do 
is face what's ahead. 
NASA maintained the 
satellites while 
we rebuilt the space station. 
We made it safer, 
made it stronger. 
It belongs to all of us now. 
One planet, one people. 
And as long as we remember 
that we share one future... 
we will survive.
