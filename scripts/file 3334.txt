Hi, moms. Stephanie here.

Welcome back to another

"Italian Odyssey" episode

of A Pinch of m*rder, your one-stop shop

for hot home tips and cold case flips.

I'm really thrilled with

the recent surge in viewers,

even if most of you are just tuning in

to see if I die.

Um, still on

the romantic island of Capri,

uh, frankly wishing I knew

even un poco italiano right about now,

'cause it might help with the police.

In hindsight, you know,

Babbel would've been a good choice.

By the way, use code word

"Hi, moms" for 20% off at Babbel.

Thanks, guys.

Um, anyway,

since I'm under house arrest now,

a lot of you have been asking

why I would put myself

in this situation in the first place.

Which is pretty rich, 'cause, you know,

you were all singing

a different tune a few days ago.

But I want to be clear.

I did not k*ll Emily's husband.

Jesus!

Okay, um...

for those of you

who are just joining us...

let me fill you in on how we got here.

A few days ago, I was running late for,

uh, my reading at the Book Nook,

and I was packing Miles up for camp,

and I was pretty flustered

'cause my Smooch is gonna be gone

for a few weeks and...

Mom, are you kidding me?!

You monogrammed my camp shirts.

Everyone's gonna laugh at me.

Well, this is way cooler than a name tag.

I'll bet the other kids

are gonna be jealous.

Don't be mad, Smooch.

I don't want to fight

in our last few moments together.

You don't care about embarrassing me?

You monogram my shirts,

you call me Smooch,

and the kids at school said that your

stupid show got that creepy guy k*lled.

Okay.

Miles. Miles.

You're right. I'm sorry, okay?

You have a mother that listens

and who doesn't do that show anymore.

Will you grab your swimsuit, 'cause

I have to be at the reading by 3:00, okay?

Everyone knows you're obsessed

with Nicky's mom.

Why'd you have to write a book about it?

The other kids tease me, and they say

you tried to Single White Female her.

Okay, she ensnared me for...

Your friends have seen

Single White Female?

That's a very adult film.

God, you're a stalker!

I don't want

any phone calls about you biting.

Remember, if you can't be smart, be funny,

and if you can't be funny, be pretty.

Okay, this is dramatic.

I know you're lashing out

because you're worried about

being away for an entire month.

I need a restraining order.

That's very big boy legal language.

Oh, come on. I think that, yes,

this time apart might be healthy...

- For the both of us, I know.

- Okay.

Stephanie Smothers,

are you helicopter parenting again?

- No, Darren, I'm not.

- Yes, Darren, she is.

I've got this.

Young lady, please don't get pregnant.

Young man, don't get anyone pregnant.

- Thanks, Darren.

- You're welcome.

Geez, Dad, cringy.

Aho! That's Lakota for "hello."

Sounds more like cultural appropriation.

Super. I don't really get you yet,

but I will, okay?

Campers, let's hop on the bus.

- Okay. Bye-bye.

- Do you want to...

- Yeah.

- I love you, too.

Mm-hmm.

- Okay.

- Best of luck.

Skin cancer is real.

Please wear sunscreen.

Call me anytime!

Ooh. No calls in or out. Camp rule.

- Even better.

- That's cool.

Go to your assigned bus!

We're gonna have the best time

of your lives!

No crying.

It'll make your eyes red, and we don't

want people to think you're smoking pot.

Although maybe we do.

It might be good for your brand.

- What's wrong with my brand?

- You haven't posted a video in months,

and you have a book coming out.

It hasn't been months.

It's been two months and three weeks.

Look, I know you went through

quite a shock,

but it's time to spring back.

The moms of the world miss you.

I wrote a book.

You did, so let's get you to your reading

and sell a shitload of those,

Stephanie Smothers.

Okay. All right, all right.

Why'd she take her channel down?

Was it tanking?

No, no, no, no. The numbers were good.

- Mm.

- Oh, too much pressure.

Brilliant strategy:

disappear from the Internet

right before you release a book.

Look, I tried to help,

but there's only so much I can do.

She's-she's tragic.

This picture is tragic.

So, I'm lobbying for

a continuation of the tour,

but it's a chicken-or-the-egg problem.

You need to sell more books

to justify the tour,

but you sell more books on tour.

Is the world stupid or am I a genius?

- Ben! Hi! You made it!

- Hey.

Hey, uh, listen,

so something happened today,

- something you need to know about, so...

- Oh, well, look.

I know you didn't want to read the book in

advance, which is totally, totally fine,

but, uh, you know, you're in it a lot,

- and I think I did, like, a good job of...

- O-Okay, St-Stephanie, listen.

yeah, like, painting

a kind of nuanced portrait...

- Stephanie, Stephanie, Stephanie.

- Yeah.

- Sorry to pull you away.

- Oh, my God!

- Just...

- Everyone,

please help me welcome full-time mom,

part-time cold case sleuth

and breakout true crime writer

Stephanie Smothers.

Yeah.

Hi.

Hi, everybody. Uh, thanks for coming.

As most of you know,

the case of the McLanden sisters,

of what Emily, aka Hope McLanden,

did to her sister Faith

was the biggest thing

that happened in Warfield since the police

busted that meth lab

that was running out of the senior center.

Um, so I wrote this book

because, uh, the k*ller was

a mom at our school

and a good friend of mine,

and in a way, we were all her victims.

"I think about her all the time,

the faceless blonde I thought I knew,

no photos, no past, a ghost.

Was she a glamorous PR executive

"or a cold-blooded k*ller?"

I'm sorry, the reading's started.

"I think about her husband Sean,

broken..."

You-you can't go in there.

"and her son Nicky

growing up without a mother."

Hey.

"I think about the small role

that I played in that...

sad... destiny."

Boo.

Is that...?

The cold-blooded k*ller.

Emily.

Holy sh*t.

Everyone, this is Emily,

the real-life faceless blonde.

Except apparently I do have a face.

And you're here. How are you here?

Did you break out of prison?

No, I'm out on appeal.

Our legal system is so f*cked.

Baby, I want to talk about

the important stuff.

Why isn't your book selling?

- It's selling.

- Mm, it's not.

I feel like... I feel like you

left out all the good stuff.

Remind me, what happened

with your brother again?

I tried to tell you. I tried.

Oh, hi.

Hi. Lovely to see you, Detective.

Hmm.

You'll be getting a subpoena soon.

I have these excellent new attorneys,

and they found possible

evidence tampering in my case.

Hello, Darren.

Terrible shoes.

Sorry I hit you with my car.

Oh, sh*t. Forgot about that.

Emily, why are you here?

You came for vengeance

in a suburban bookstore?

Stephanie, please. You're my best friend.

I mean, you lit my f*cking life on fire,

but you saved me.

You gave me a clean slate.

That's why I'm gonna spend

the rest of my life

trying to find ways to thank you.

That's the most terrifying thing

she's said yet.

Okay, that's complete bullshit.

It's true.

Thanks to you, I'm getting married.

How did that happen?

Oh, you know, the good old-fashioned way.

- Bathroom sex?

- No one knows me like you do.

Which is why I, um...

which is why I came

to ask you something.

Uh, Stephanie Smothers, will you, uh...

Oh. Will you be my maid of honor?

Oh, she's definitely f*cking with you.

It's a trick.

She's gonna get you alone and k*ll you.

Poison you or s*ab you.

She's gonna make it look like a suicide.

- I'm aware of that.

- Holy f*ck.

Is it maybe just a little bit possible

that I've changed?

No.

Stephanie, baby, please, come on.

Don't do this. I hate when we fight.

- Come... No, no, no.

- Get away from me.

I-I was the best thing

that ever happened to you.

We both know it.

You-you stopped apologizing.

You f*cked my husband.

He was such a crotch rot.

Thank you for that, by the way.

You wrote a book based on me,

and you built an entirely new life.

Like, why am I having to beg you?

- You owe me.

- The f*ck I do.

Mm, you do.

Okay, let's agree to disagree.

You need me.

You're gonna watch your sales

and your followers soar

as you maid-of-honor the sh*t

out of the woman

who tried to m*rder you

at the wedding of the decade.

Did I mention it was in Capri?

Capri?

Yes, she is in.

We're all in. Thank you.

You can't just come in here

and bulldoze me, Emily.

I'm not as nice as I used to be.

Oh, sweetie, you were never nice.

You were just afraid to be mean.

Okay, then I'm less afraid.

Perfect, then prove it.

And if I do try to m*rder you,

it'll make an amazing sequel.

Okay, I'll see you 9:00 a.m. Wednesday

on my fianc's private plane.

Oh, and if you don't come,

I'm gonna have to sue you into oblivion

for using my name and likeness

without my express written consent.

Don't try me, Bubba.

Love you so much.

- Can she sue me?

- Plausibly.

Yeah, lawsuits can be a real k*ller.

You shouldn't risk it. Just go to Capri.

Shut up, Darren.

You know, Emily is right.

The book needs a boost.

- And that sequel thing...

- The sequel where I'm m*rder*d?

- Uh...

- Hi. Are you gonna start

doing your show again

now that you can follow

the faceless blonde on another adventure?

Follow? I...

She's the one who can't leave me alone.

It doesn't matter.

Oh, yeah, yeah, totally.

So please sign it, "To Bernice,"

and can you date the signature

just in case you don't make it back?

I don't think we need to...

to do that, no.

What is Emily up to? This is so crazy.

And crazy sells books!

Do you think Hunter S. Thompson

would turn down this opportunity?

Hunter S. Thompson was addicted to cocaine

and did not have a ten-year-old son.

I get it. I'm sorry.

It's just the boxed wine talking.

You know what? Take care of yourself.

Don't worry about true crime.

Write a cookbook.

I hit up all my sources.

No one knows anything about

this fianc of hers.

Summerville said that, this morning,

a team of high-powered lawyers showed up,

and an hour later,

Emily walked out of prison.

I went down to the courthouse,

and I checked the court records.

There's no indication of who hired them.

She's definitely up to something.

She's just gonna be up to it

in the most gorgeous place on Earth.

Yeah, but what does she want

to do to me there?

I mean, she wants me there for a reason.

I don't think it's to be a maid of honor.

Maybe she really did change in prison?

I mean,

marrying somebody with enough money

to have a private jet

and get you out of jail?

I mean, that could definitely

normal you the f*ck out.

No, no, no. I don't buy it.

Well, since you're too busy building

a m*rder board in your head

to check your feed...

Holy sh*t, 42,000 likes?

Yeah, and that's just one of the many

videos of your showdown at your reading.

Stephanie?

You'll forgive me

if I'm a little paranoid.

God.

Got to figure out what she's up to.

So?

Are you gonna go?

You don't own me

I'm not just one of your many toys

You don't own me

Don't say I can't go with other boys

And don't tell me what to do

Don't tell me what to say...

This is nice.

Your tits are nice.

Come on. We're late.

Sorry, Vicky had to pick up some stuff.

- That's the toiletries.

- Yes, ma'am.

Uh-huh. Okay, yeah.

You brought your f*cking assistant

to my wedding?

She's my book agent.

And she's an insurance policy.

Oh.

'Cause I won't k*ll you both?

You're cute.

Hi, moms.

Stephanie here, on the way

to the faceless blonde's Capri wedding.

I think I'm probably

gonna take a long nap.

I'm just gonna curl up,

and I'll see you guys...

Oh, perfect.

Ma'am, no filming on board.

It violates the passengers' privacy.

Oh, sorry.

I-I didn't realize

there would be so many people.

Thought my carbon footprint

would be a little higher.

Makes me feel more glamorous.

You got it.

All gone.

Oh, my God, this flight is full of A-list.

Who the hell is Emily marrying?

I don't know, but I want one.

Listen, I know how this sounds,

but murdering her sister

really upped Emily's game.

Do you know how that sounds?

This kind of glamour and intrigue is

exactly why we're here,

so we should be live streaming.

They won't let me use my phone.

Oh, then start secretly banking stuff,

and use this into-the-lion's-den scenario

as a way to get you another book deal.

Time to get eaten by the lion.

Mm-hmm.

Hey, are you friends with Emily's fianc?

The toilet's clogged,

and my seat won't recline... 3A.

I don't work here, but...

No photography.

As I believe we discussed.

Oh, sure, but, you know,

how much privacy

does leaded crystal really need?

Okay. It's going in my pocket.

You're so funny.

Looks like you could use this.

It's 10:00 a.m.

Not in Capri.

Jesus Christ.

This again? I'm not gonna poison you.

It's not my style.

You have the duration of this flight

to chill the f*ck out.

I want you g*dd*mn sparkling when we land.

Do you hear me?

This is really f*cking weird, man.

Mm, yeah, I know.

Just go with it.

You excited for my bachelorette party?

Oh, yeah. These guys seem awesome.

Yeah, they're kind of the worst.

They're his family's friends.

Oh, God, wait till you meet

the c**t-in-law.

Oopsie.

Hmm. I missed you.

Want to get out of here?

Where? The luggage compartment?

Come on, baby girl.

Wow. Classy.

Did you get me a stripper? Is it you?

Oh, you wish.

It's his family's style.

They swing money around

like a baseball bat.

- Sure.

- Lucky me.

Who's the lucky guy?

- DV?

- What, are you writing a book?

His name's Dante Versano.

Old money, but, you know,

cute enough to f*ck eyes open.

Total alpha male, like me.

Not a little snatch like Sean.

Do you know Sean never took Nicky

to visit me in jail, not once?

I haven't seen my kid in five years.

Maybe he thought it was dangerous.

It's jail.

The bad guys are already locked up.

Wait, I'm sorry.

Are you defending him?

'Cause he wasn't exactly a dream date

for you, either, husband-fucker.

Good one. You got me.

Oh, how'd you meet Dante?

I moved to Rome for a minute

when I was in my 20s.

I was totally broke but in heaven.

It was all so big and dangerous

and cunty and chic.

Rome, not my job.

My job was just at a dive bar,

but that's where I met Dante.

He was just... oh, he was gorgeous

and... and so sweet.

And we struck up a real connection,

and he taught me Italian.

You know? In all the ways.

Everyone was talking about us,

even the local press.

I was calling myself Olivia back then.

Bathroom, 20 seconds.

Knock twice.

You know, obviously

all that attention spooked me, so...

I had to leave town, and...

yeah, I just, I don't know,

wrote it off as a, as a tryst.

I thought he forgot about it.

This guy, I mean, he could have...

he could have anyone, but alas.

So you reconnected after all these years,

told him your real name...

your new real name...

and he took you back

even though you were in jail.

Yeah, I mean, I do kind of owe you.

He saw me on the news, thanks to you.

Tracked me down,

and we picked up like no time was lost.

Who knows? Play your cards right,

I might end up dead again

and you can f*ck this one, too.

Aw, you having fun?

I mean, this is why you brought me, right?

Keep 'em coming.

Oh, lighten up.

I am busting your b*lls.

You need to get laid.

Jesus, I get laid plenty.

Oh. Do you?

Do tell.

Look who started getting nasty

after I went to the slammer.

And look who's willing to do

whatever it takes not to go back.

You think I'm not really in love

or you think no one could love me?

That's not what I said, but...

it's telling.

Why am I here?

You think I invited you to get revenge?

For stealing my life

and taking my kid away from me?

You think I want to make you pay?

I don't know. Do you?

I don't think so.

- Morning, babe.

- Oh, I missed you.

Miss you so much.

Oh, I missed you more. Let's go.

- How was the trip?

- Let's go. So good.

- Oh, no, no, you have to meet her first.

- Oh. Who?

- Hi.

- Oh. Oh, this must be the maid of honor.

- Ah.

- What a lovely creature.

Oh. Yes, I'm Stephanie.

Oh, I told you he lays it on thick.

Does he have a brother?

Why? Are you into f*cking brothers?

Sadly, I'm an only child.

Oh, that's too bad.

That's just a... we've got a...

She's so funny.

- She's funny, huh?

- How is the monster-in-law?

- Very excited for the wedding.

- Uh-huh.

She said she has a surprise for you.

It's your day.

- I won't let anything ruin it, baby.

- Okay.

Can somebody help me

with my f*cking bags?!

Okay.

I should just jump in one of these cars?

as*h*le!

What the f*ck are you doing?

Excuse me. I didn't recognize you.

I'm sorry. I will move immediately.

Stupid f*ck.

I'm so sorry, ladies.

I-I hope that didn't cause you

too much distress.

We're fine. Thank you.

No.

Well, welcome to Italy.

Who is this guy?

For God's sake. Nicky!

Can you cut it out with the drone, please?

You're gonna give me a brain aneurysm

over here or something.

I can put it on stealth mode.

- Well, why do you have to run it at all?

- I'm looking for Mom.

You don't need a drone

to find your mom, okay?

Just follow the trail of destruction.

Oh. Hey, Nicky, Nicky!

Mom!

My baby!

Oh, look how big you are.

You got so big and red.

Oh, my God. This is my boy.

- Hey, what's up?

- This is Nicky.

- I hate that I missed a moment.

- Me, too.

Your being in prison

gave me street cred at school,

and my friends loved reading your letters.

Yeah, and they got you expelled,

didn't they?

- Three schools in two years.

- We're just gonna

have to find him a school

without a stick up its a*s, huh, Bubba?

Stephanie?

Hello, sir.

What are you...

Oh, God, I'm so sorry. I forgot.

- Stephanie's coming.

- Right.

Hey, do you remember Stephanie, baby?

Yeah, Dad f*cked her.

- Mm! Mm.

- Where did you learn

- language like that, sir?

- Jesus.

Nicky, I just want to say I'm so sorry

about everything that happened.

Oh, no, don't-don't... don't be.

I mean, you weren't an as*h*le

like my dad or anything.

as*h*le dad.

- Yep.

- Yep.

And Miles is pretty cool, too.

I know Miles misses you a lot.

Me, too.

I mean, things just got f*cked, so...

- Jesus Christ.

- Okay.

- Oh, wow.

- You know, I try with the swearing,

but what's the f*cking point these days?

- Can you not be day drunk around my kid?

- Day drunk?

Yeah, it might help

if you sober up a little.

You're judging me, are you?

We're all here because of you

and your f*cking wedding or whatever...

My love, Dante, this is my baby mama Sean.

- Oh, yeah. Hey, it's the one.

- Uh-huh, yeah.

Yeah, yeah.

Hi. It means a great deal

that you're here.

Oh. I mean, the courts ordered me

to drag my son across an ocean,

so you must be paying your lawyers

an awful amount, because we're here.

Yeah.

I'm still glad that you're here

to celebrate our marriage.

- Well, "celebrate" is...

- Oh, yeah.

quite the strong word,

because I would rather shave my b*lls

with a rusty knife

than be at this wedding.

- Oh, let me do that for you.

- Yeah?

- Please.

- Yeah.

But you know what?

Here we are.

Anyway, it's your funeral, pal.

I'm off to the pool.

I'm gonna go find somebody

I haven't f*cked.

- Bye.

- Hey, we're gonna go upstairs.

I got to get ready for the lunch.

You must always give the audience

what they came for.

- Yes.

- Take notes.

Bubby, it's okay.

Come on, come on, come on.

- It is not okay. It's not okay.

- It's okay.

Yeah, I don't think you have to worry

about Emily k*lling you

because they're all gonna

k*ll each other first.

The toilet's clogged.

That needs to stop happening.

Oh. For you, friend.

Wonderful.

There she is.

Fancy meeting you here.

You know, I still can't believe

that you came to this.

- Oh, I couldn't miss out on all the fun.

- Mm-hmm.

- How are you holding up?

- I'm good.

As long as they keep plying me

with enough booze

to k*ll a small show pony, I'll be fine.

Great.

I am curious, though.

What did she say to you

to convince you to come to this farce?

Oh, um, a little emotional blackmail,

a potential lawsuit,

sort of dangling my livelihood

over my head.

- Mm.

- You know, just girlfriend stuff.

Well, here's to murderous girlfriends

and murderous exes,

and of course congratulations

for all your success.

Thanks.

Whoa.

We think this is for real?

They seem happy.

No.

Well, Emily has a very short list

of people that she cares about:

Nicky and Emily.

End of list.

You and I, we don't even make that cut.

Especially not that

Italian Stallion over there.

Well, my mom always said

holding a grudge was like

drinking poison and waiting

for the other person to die.

Same old Stephanie.

Softball advice

with a side of zucchini muffins,

which if I remember correctly,

were some of

the most delicious things

that I've ever had in my mouth.

That took a weird turn, Sean.

- Come on.

- You still make those, though, right?

Yeah, I... yes, I still enjoy baking.

And you're phenomenal at it.

And you match that

with the whole crime solving thing,

and... amazing.

I read your book, by the way.

I think I came to the conclusion that, um,

the only thing

that you and I had in common

was that we were both obsessed with Emily.

Obsession? Sean.

Seriously, Stephanie, listen to me.

If a grudge is self-inflicted poison,

then the person who invited you

to this wedding

is the most poisoned person

that I have ever met.

She doesn't let go.

And you are the biggest grudge

of her life.

That so?

Don't trust her for a minute.

Anyhoos, if we're not going to be f*cking,

then I am off to cement my reputation

as the drunken malcontent of an ex.

Wish me luck.

Hi, moms. Stephanie here.

Uh, all the way in Capri,

still safe and sound so far.

Check out this place, huh?

Good thing they put up all the flowers.

Otherwise, these ancient ruins

would be real disappointing.

- Give me the phone now.

- Whoa!

Jesus Christ!

What's the problem?

If Signor Bartolo sees this

he will crush the phone...

and throw the woman off the cliff.

It's all good. Go. Go! Now!

What is that?

Why do they have g*ns?

Because that makes k*lling efficient.

Can you put that thing away?

It's go... I didn't...

- I wasn't doing anything.

- Just don't let them...

He already saw you. Uh, Matteo saw you.

- Just-just do what he says, okay?

- Who...

What? Okay, all right.

The families are on a truce.

Hey, look at me.

- Stop that.

- We agreed with the rules.

No pictures of the Bartolos at this event.

She didn't understand. She...

Miss America, delete everything you have

on your phone, okay?

- Right now.

- Matteo, Matteo, Matteo, Matteo, Matteo.

Calm down, everyone, okay?

Stephanie is a visitor.

- She didn't know that. Yeah.

- Oh, yes.

I didn't know.

She didn't know. She's a visitor.

- Yeah.

- Yes. And whose fault is that?

Huh?

You're the one

who continues to bring

f*cking Americans into our business.

Please stay calm. I'll handle her.

I'll handle this.

Okay, baby.

Baby, baby. I'll-I'll deal with him.

I'll deal with him.

Don't worry, baby. Don't worry.

First of all...

we're not doing business.

There won't be a single photo

of a Bartolo.

I won't allow it.

I'm going for a walk.

I'm going with him. See you later.

Yeah, I got you.

So hot, right?

Dante's in the Mob?

The Bartolos and Versanos

are business rivals.

- Everybody here's in the Mob?

- Stop saying "Mob"

or you're gonna get us both whacked.

Look at your face.

Yeah, but seriously, don't say it.

'Cause they won't whack me,

but, you know, they might whack you, so...

Come on.

Close your mouth. Shut the f*ck up.

Let's get a drink.

These are real.

They're not... they're not fake.

I swear.

- Mama.

- Oh.

You look amazing.

No amount of fashion can rescue

this marriage from disaster.

- Oh, lovely.

- Mama.

Mama Portia, good to see you.

This is Stephanie. Stephanie Smothers,

- this is Portia Versano.

- Yeah.

Hi. It's nice to meet you.

You look beautiful.

Oh, coming from you,

that means very little.

Let's eat.

God, Mama.

I'm in love with her.

Everyone!

Before we begin, I have a surprise for

the charming woman who has kidnapped

my Dante's heart.

- I hate surprises.

- I don't know what it is.

- Tell me what it is.

- I don't know, my love. Honestly.

I was truly upset

when Dante told me that Emily had

no one to stand by her side at the wedding

except for a relative stranger.

Oh, I'm not a stranger. She...

Oh, poor Olivia...

Oh, I apologize. Emily.

- Oh.

- And so, my dear Emily,

this is my wedding gift to you.

The gift of your own true family.

Your dear, dear mother Margaret.

Wave, wave.

Baby, uh...

- You f*cking c**t.

- Mama...

I'm so happy I came.

- Ow.

- Oh, just come on, walk.

See, now?

I said I didn't want to be in Italy.

- I want to be home with Bruce.

- Bruce is dead, honey.

We keep talking about this

over and over again.

- I know.

- Come on.

Oh! Monkey face!

Oh.

Oh, my gosh, I haven't seen you

since you were a baby.

But you prob... oh, you probably

don't remember me.

It's your Auntie Linda.

Oh.

I delivered you and your sister.

- Yeah, uh, so my mom told us.

- Mm-hmm.

Yeah. I thought she made you up.

I didn't make her up.

She ushered you all in, from Hell.

Now, Margaret, be nice.

They came out of your womb,

for goodness' sake.

Look what a gorgeous young woman you've

- grown up to be.

- Mm.

I have to tell you,

I tried to track you down forever,

but it's like you just disappeared

off the face of the earth.

But now look at us.

- I'm here at your wedding!

- Yeah.

Come, say hi to your mother.

Margaret, look who's here.

- It's your daughter.

- Yeah.

Faith?

No, honey, Faith is dead. It's Hope.

Hope?

Hello, Mother. You look different.

- I had work done.

- Huh.

Is that your son?

Yeah. Okay, yeah.

- You don't need to... You can just...

- Are you really my grandma?

Yeah, this is her. Yeah.

Oh. Oh.

Demon spawn.

- I'm sorry, what?

- Child of Satan.

It's alive.

Arsonist. m*rder*r.

You crazy old witch,

you ruined my childhood.

I'm not gonna let you ruin his.

- Okay?

- Linda, where is Bruce?

No, you stay away from me.

Everybody, listen.

When she started bleeding,

I wanted them to sterilize her,

but they wouldn't do it, would they? No.

They didn't understand

that there is evil inside her,

and evil is the only thing

that can come out.

Margaret. It's okay, everybody.

It's just a bit of jet lag.

Now, Margaret, nobody likes to hear you

go all fire and brimstone.

Let's go back to the hotel,

and we'll get you a Gibson.

- Thank you.

- Yes, come...

You know, Linda, I know what you did.

Yeah, I saw the ashes.

I mean, who burns a baby?

Right?

Oh.

Uh, sorry.

She'll, uh, she'll be right as rain

after a couple Gibsons and a-a nap.

Thank you so much.

My-my Bubba. Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.

- Are you okay?

- Your mom's a big fat d*ck.

My mom, my mom...

What's so funny?

I mean, what's not funny?

You know, Emily tried to play out

some revenge fantasy

by getting us to come to this bollocks,

and then she gets outplayed

by her future mother-in-law.

I mean,

I couldn't write it better myself.

You couldn't write

a grocery list yourself.

Oh. How original.

I mean, I thought you might have

gone wittier with your stint in prison,

but I guess you were too busy

finger-banging your cellmates.

I mean, what's next,

some sort of withering put-down

about the size of my p*nis?

Oh, God, no. No, no.

I actually thought it was a belly button.

Honestly, for, like, a year straight.

Mm, a belly button.

Well, in compared

to your cavernous vag*na, sure.

You know, sometimes

I thought I was f*cking

a wind sock in a rainstorm.

You're a f*cking psychopath!

Your entire family are psychopaths.

And what's more, you're marrying

some sort of budget mafioso.

No court in the world's

gonna turn me down.

What the f*ck are you talking about?

Oh, I didn't tell you?

I'm petitioning for full custody of Nicky.

Oh, sh*t.

What, you don't let me see

my kid for five years,

and then you think you're gonna

take him away from me forever?

No. No.

Sean, do you want to, um,

have the conversation somewhere el...

You ruined my f*cking life!

First they thought I was a m*rder*r,

and then they thought I was

some sort of pathetic loser

because I couldn't keep

some Internet-famous housewife happy.

I'm a literary pariah,

and all because I stuck my d*ck

into the both of you.

Enough! Shut the f*ck up!

Shut the f*ck up.

That's enough.

With all respect,

I think it's time for you to go.

With all due respect, f*ck you.

And suck my d*ck.

Wow.

What a family

you're marrying into, figlio mio.

Of all the people

you could have married,

- you had to choose this one.

- -Can you shut her the f*ck up?

Is there anybody who wants dessert?

I guess I'll go talk to her.

What's going on?

What a f*cking mess.

Do you know what I'd do to Sean

if I wasn't so close to being free?

Drown him in a lake?

Come on, it's a joke.

You know, this is all your fault.

If you would've just let me disappear

after my sister died,

I could've collected that insurance money,

taken Nicky away.

I wouldn't have had to deal

with any of this sh*t.

Sure. But how would you have

gotten him away from Sean?

You know, back in, uh, back in the day,

this place was run

by this dude named Tiberius.

He was the emperor.

And he became known for this...

this charming little thing

called the Leap of Tiberius.

Basically, he just invited people here

to be an entertaining diversion,

to amuse him.

But if they didn't amuse him, he...

he threw them off the f*cking cliff.

Huh.

Maybe that's why I brought you here.

To be my entertaining diversion, you know,

with your whole mommy crime hour and your,

"Oh, no, what's Emily

gonna do to me next?"

All that pearl clutching of yours.

But I'm not feeling entertained.

Or amused.

You know, if you toss me off a cliff,

you'll never see Nicky again.

Huh.

I'm not gonna throw you off a cliff, baby.

You're my maid of honor. I need you.

Sean, on the other hand...

Okay.

I'm going back to this event from Hell.

I'll see you later

at my bachelorette party.

Oh, I'm a little jet laggy,

- so I'm probably just gonna skip it.

- No, no, no.

Go back to the hotel, take a nap.

I'd skip this thing if I could.

And wear a bathing suit.

If you stand me up,

I will toss you off the f*cking cliff.

Come on, Steph.

Stephanie.

Stephanie.

Come on!

f*ck!

Stupid f*cking d*ck again!

Hello?

I don't need room service, thank you.

Unless you're Dante's mom.

Then come on in.

The f*ck?

I don't want to talk to you.

Get out of here. Ow.

Why would you do that?

f*ck.

Hi, moms.

Stephanie here. Still alive. So far.

I'm just heading to the pool

for the bachelorette party.

Hope I'm not the first person there.

You're late.

You remember Emily.

Hi, Stephanie fans.

Do your fans have a label?

The Smotherettes?

The Smother Me To Deaths?

It's a branding opportunity.

You need to be on this sh*t.

No one else is coming?

- No one else was invited.

- Oh.

This way, we have the place

all to ourselves.

Oh, how about the Steph Infections?

Catchy, layered. Love. Vote on it, ladies.

We don't need to vote. I don't think we...

- Yeah, we do.

- Oh, they're voting. Oh.

Wow. Well, I'm gonna sign off.

If I die, show this video to the police!

- Ah! Oh, my God!

- Oh, my God, she's hilarious.

She did it!

Oh, but seriously.

We're making a martini with ice.

I told you, Stephanie,

I'm a changed woman.

A little watering down never hurt anyone.

Other than your sister Faith.

Oh, sh*t!

Are you for real right now?

What?

After all I've done for you?

Look at all this.

This is all for you, baby.

Your numbers just went through the roof.

You can thank me for this.

How'd we get the place to ourselves?

I rented it out.

I'm so sick of everyone else.

Ugh.

Ah, just like old times, you know?

You, me and a couple super dry martinis.

To old friends, new beginnings.

And not getting poisoned.

Mm.

How long?

Two minutes, 37 seconds.

- Best one yet.

- That's it?

No, that was your best one.

Come on, Smothers.

Ugh. No.

Kate Winslet, she could do it

for like seven minutes

when she was preparing for, um,

The One of Wat...

The Way... The Way of Water.

- Mm. Mm-hmm.

- The Avatar thing.

I saw a whole thing on YouTube.

She's amazing.

Yeah, well, she also k*lled Jack, so...

I know, right?

Girl, move over.

- Totally. Cold-blooded m*rder.

- There is room.

- There is room.

- Mm-hmm.

What is going on with Sean?

- He's so mean now. He's so mean and drunk.

- Yeah.

Yeah, I'm not worried about him.

Totally.

No. Wait, what?

That's very ominous. Say more things.

Come on, you love it.

You do. Crime's your kink.

No. No.

I don't, um...

I stopped all that. I was... lousy at it.

You were not. I watched all your stuff

in the computer lab.

Uh, listen.

- The-the ice cream truck guy who was...

- Super fan.

I am a super fan.

No, no, no.

You're genuinely good at it, though.

You are.

The-the guy who was laundering money.

- Yeah.

- And the, and the-the meditation mommy

who was locking her nanny

in the basement.

It's so f*cked up.

She was a disgrace to moms.

And the one... that creep, the swim coach.

The guy who was filming the-the kids

- in the locker room. f*ck.

- Oh, yeah, yeah, the...

- "The Speedo Pedo."

- Yeah.

Yeah, that was, that was a real mess.

I know. He was a f*cking perv.

Good riddance.

Yeah. Yeah.

No, I didn't do it.

I'm explaining to everyone out there

that I didn't do it.

I'm just trying to figure out the truth.

You ruined my f*cking life.

We can figure this out, okay?

Don't.

What? What's up?

What are you doing?

Oh, there's more.

There is very specifically

no more.

- The guy is dead, so...

- No. No, no, no.

No, I'm supposed to believe

that-that Super Mommy

feels bad for a pedophile?

- I don't buy that.

- No, I was the one who found

the photo cache, and...

he shot himself right in front of me,

so it's not a great memory.

Okay.

And the cops, um, they weren't s-sure

if the evidence was planted on his comp...

I don't know. I don't know.

You think he was innocent.

If he wasn't guilty, it's too late now.

Well, I don't know.

I don't know about that.

People don't come back from the dead.

Except you.

'Cause you-you caught me, as*h*le.

I wish you didn't, but you did

because your instincts are f*cking great.

If you think he was guilty, he was guilty.

Ugh, low-self-esteem Stephanie

is such a boner k*ller.

Can you just go back to being cute? Oh.

You do have terrible instincts in men.

- There you go.

- Thank you.

- You're welcome.

- Thank you.

No, no. You're the one who married Sean.

Mm. Ugh.

Please. Ugh, I just threw up in my mouth.

I hate it. Don't even talk about it.

- I hate it.

- And Dante's very, uh...

very sexy, very rich, very all the things.

Mm. You know.

But?

We've all seen The Godfather.

You know?

It doesn't work out great

for Diane Keaton.

Hmm.

Well, Diane Keaton

didn't write her ending.

I write mine.

Dad!

I know it's past curfew,

and I'm sorry I stayed out so late.

I lost my key, okay?

I'm-I'm sorry.

Hey, Nicky.

Your dad's probably asleep.

He was, uh, pretty tired when I saw him.

He's probably passed out drunk again.

Um... tell you what.

Why don't you go to the front desk,

and we'll have the housekeeper

let us in, okay?

I'll wait here in case your dad comes out.

- Okay?

- Okay.

So, the maid opened the door...

and there he was.

Just the way you all saw him.

I had just finished my clay mask,

which is step three in my nightly regimen,

when I heard Stephanie screaming.

That was the housekeeper. I don't scream.

Well, I tell you, I just came running.

Mind you, I barely knew him.

A tragic accident.

We hate it when such things

happen on the island.

Never good for tourism.

This is truly a nightmare.

Darling, we must postpone the wedding.

- Mom, I must get married.

- No, but it's not possible...

Mom, I cannot change the wedding date.

That's not even possible.

Signora McLanden,

I'm very sorry for your loss.

Thank you, Detective.

Despite everything, Sean was a good man.

I'll let you all get some sleep.

Good night.

Alright, let's go.

Not to be callous,

but this solves a lot of problems for you.

Wow, that was callous.

And yeah.

I guess it does.

Excuse me.

Hi. Um, sorry.

Just... How can you be so sure

that this was an accident?

He was drunk when we all saw him last,

but drunk people generally don't just

bleed out of their eyes, nose and mouth.

I mean, just doesn't that seem odd to you?

I know you haven't had time

to run a toxicology,

much less an autopsy.

American women

and your true crime obsession.

Thank you, signora, for your concern,

but we have dealt with cases

like this many times.

- This was simply a tragic accident.

- Tragic accident. I heard you.

There are a lot of people at this wedding

who have reason to want Sean dead.

Some more than others.

The Versanos are fine,

upstanding people, signora.

Neither they nor anyone they would invite

to this island would ever cause harm.

So I suggest you get some sleep

and get ready for the big day tomorrow.

Hmm?

Hi.

- Where have you been?

- I'm sorry.

I found the cutest little restaurant

and had the cutest little

three bottles of wine.

You look upset.

Sean's dead.

I think Emily might have k*lled him.

Oh, my God.

- Fantastic!

- Jesus! Vicky!

Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

You know, it's just

the three bottles of wine

and the 15 years of trying to find

a hit g*dd*mn book talking.

Are you sure it was Emily?

No. I mean, she had every reason to,

and now she has some kind of, like,

diplomatic immunity or something,

'cause all the cops here

are terrified of her new Mafia family.

Wait, Mafia?

Emily is marrying into the Mob?

You would know all this

if you were here doing your job.

I'm sorry, but yes!

That's amazing.

I'm sorry.

Okay. New plan.

Do not post anything on social media,

'cause that's what k*lled the first book.

Everybody already knew that story.

Good night, Vicky.

Oh, honey, you're in shock! You need me!

Jesus.

I brought you a cornetto.

I don't know.

I've just never understood biscotti.

It's visually dull. It tastes like chalk.

Absolutely

sorry excuse for a pastry.

Why are you following me?

I'm sorry. Do I know you?

I guess, 'cause you were at my reading,

and then you were outside my wine bar,

and now you're in Italy.

It's crazy. Are you a stalker?

Do I need Mace? 'Cause I have Mace.

I didn't think you could see me.

I am so bad at observe and report.

- It's, like, insane.

- Sorry, um...

Observe and report?

Are... are you a cop?

Agent Irene Walker.

- FBI.

- You're FBI?

- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

- Really?

Dressed like that?

I'm undercover.

Okay. Um, and why are you following me?

Do you know this woman?

That... that's Emily's Aunt Linda.

That's the, um...

She's at the Dress Barn.

That's right around the corner

from the Book Nook.

Well, yeah, this was taken

the same day as your reading.

Linda was in Warfield?

Uh, and who's-who's that?

Possible accomplice.

Right.

Wait, that's Emily.

That's Emily's tattoo.

I... I thought they just met.

Wh... Sorry. Why are you following Linda?

Um, I didn't say that I w...

I said too much.

- I... Give me my phone back. No.

- No, you...

Give me my phone back. I'm not saying it...

You are following me...

Stephanie.

Hi.

Hey.

Good morning.

I see you're making friends.

Well, the power of the Internet.

You know?

She's, um, a big fan of my show.

- "Hi, moms."

- That's the show I do.

Oh, my goodness, Stephanie.

It seems like you're

an international superstar.

Well, you know, the moms are everywhere.

So true. Everyone has one.

Have so much fun on the rest of your trip.

- Thank... Yes, you, too. Absolutely.

- Yeah.

Uh, wait, wait.

Uh, do you want me to take

your picture with her?

Yeah, I would. Of course I would.

- It would be weird if you didn't.

- It would be so weird

- if I didn't want that, so I do.

- Yeah. Yeah, of course.

Um, you can take it on my phone.

- Well, open your camera for him.

- Yeah.

Don't just hand him your unlocked phone

- like a crazy person.

- Right.

Let's be safe, ladies.

- Here you go.

- Let's see. Cheers.

Let's do it. All right.

I wish.

All right. All right.

Three, two, one.

Three, two, one, and three, two, one.

Aw, beautiful.

Thank you. Amazing.

Yeah, have...

Have a good day.

You, too, big-big guy. You're a big guy.

Okay, um, Stephanie, I'll see you around.

Or I'll see you... I'll-I'll be wa...

- I'll be watching your videos or...

- Okay.

- I'll wa... be watching online.

- On the Internet. Okay. Yep.

Must be hard being so popular, right?

Price of fame.

- Yeah.

- Yeah.

Um...

I should probably find Emily, you know?

I'm sure she needs something.

- Big day and all.

- Right.

Maid of honor never rests, right?

I'll just...

Just gonna... squeeze past you here.

Okay.

Maid of honor never rests.

- Ben?

- Hello. Hello?

Can you run a background check

on someone for me?

- Linda McLanden?

- McLanden?

Related to Emily?

Uh, it's her aunt. Yeah.

Uh, can you look her up on the FBI system?

Yeah, I could, uh,

hit up my boy Jim in the New York office.

- But what's up?

- I don't know,

but I need to.

Okay, thanks.

You're the best. Sorry to wake you.

Ah, come on, I wasn't asleep.

- Of course you weren't.

- Hey, Steph,

it's nice to hear you back in the game.

I'm not back in the game.

Everyone else but me is just incompetent.

Okay, bye.

Oh! Oh! Stephanie.

My goodness, you gave me such a fright.

I'm so sorry.

- How are you, sweetie?

- Oh, I'm good.

- I'm just here to check on Emily.

- Oh, don't.

I wouldn't bother with that.

- She is in a real mood.

- Oh.

Threw both me and her dressmaker out.

I think she's taking

Sean's death pretty hard.

Sure. It would be weird if she didn't.

Yeah, so I think it's best

if we just give her

all the space she needs

- before the wedding, you know.

- Oh.

We all process the happiest day

of our life differently.

- Oh.

- Don't we?

- Yeah, we sure do.

- Yeah.

It's so great

that you're here for her now.

So great that you're here for her, too.

So I'll see you at the altar.

I will see you at the altar.

- Not if I see you first.

- Oh.

Well...

time to get beautiful.

As if it's possible for you

to be any more beautiful.

Oh, you're so sweet.

You look lovely, Emily.

Do I?

I, Dante,

take you, Emily, as my wife...

until death do us part.

Until death do us part.

In the name of the Father...

I now pronounce you husband and wife.

Clap.

Clap. Who got married?

Oh, my God.

Um, Mama, can I, um...

can I go play with my drone?

- You okay?

- Yeah, yeah.

- Okay.

- Thank you. I love you.

I love you.

Okay.

Right.

Yep.

Thank you. Thanks for being here to share

this new beginning with us both.

I'd like to make a-a toast

to someone who changed my life.

When my father died,

I was very young.

My mother Portia stepped up,

- protected me.

- Aw.

Taught me how to run a family business.

So, I wouldn't be who I am today

without your love and sacrifices.

- Aw.

- Yeah. Really.

You taught me how to be a man.

So it's in your honor...

yeah, it's in your honor that I do this.

This is my prenup.

And this...

is the fire of love.

What the f*ck are you doing?

Oh. That's fire.

Some have questioned about

bringing an American into our fold.

Let no one doubt how far I'll go for love.

To peace.

Peace between those I love,

but even more than that...

Peace.

Peace...

between the Bartolos and the Versanos.

Peace.

Cheers.

I am in Hell.

This is Hell...

and I'm being punished for my sins.

My lovely Emily

has informed me that, um,

Stephanie Smothers,

her maid of honor and, um, dear friend,

will make a toast as well.

Oh.

- Stephanie.

- Whoo!

Oh, it's a nightmare. Hello!

I'm Stephanie. I am the maid of honor.

So I have a speech that I will say now.

It's difficult to follow

someone burning their prenup.

Kind of a d*ck move.

Really set me up to fail. Just kidding.

What can I say about Emily?

I met Emily because our sons were friends

and motherhood is a powerful bond.

This creature just comes

screaming out of your body,

rips you in half really.

But marriage, you know,

when does marriage not work out?

Uh, in my case...

m*rder-suicide, and in Emily's,

you know, just the classic laundry list:

extortion, identity fraud,

fratricide, prison.

But you two are gonna be great.

I've got a feeling.

Did you guys know that, uh,

married couples cannot be

compelled to testify

against each other in court?

So, congratulations.

Let's kick this off with a bang!

Oh.

- Assholes.

- Thank you, Stephanie.

That was beautiful.

My pleasure.

Oh, Lord have mercy.

I cannot believe

he burned the prenup.

That's who Dante is.

He loves grand gestures.

Let's hope nothing happens to him.

Another martini, signora?

Why not, Alessandro?

- No ice.

- Never.

Your martini, signora. No ice.

Thank you.

Are you

f*cking drunk? Put down the g*n.

Put down the g*n!

Put down the g*n!

Put down the g*n!

Help!

Help! Help! Help!

We need help! We need an ambulance!

- Are you okay? What happened?

- Dante!

Dante's in there!

What are you doing here?

Go there! Get him out!

What do you know about this?

What do you know about this?!

Nothing! No, he was here five minutes ago!

I-I... Stephanie, what did you see?

Um, uh, he was arguing with someone,

and I couldn't see anything,

and then they started sh**ting him,

and they just kept sh**ting him,

- then it exploded!

- Someone shot my son?

- Wait, who was he fighting with?

- I don't know.

- You didn't see?

- No, I couldn't.

- You didn't see anything?

- No.

- Nothing?

- No!

No.

You tricked him

into giving you everything.

And then this happens?

One hour later?

- Coincidence?

- No, no, no, no.

She was with me this entire time

watching the fireworks.

She couldn't have done this, I swear.

You don't say that.

I loved him so much. Don't say that.

And excuse me,

but any number of people here

would have reasons to k*ll him.

Isn't half this place a-a rival g*ng?

I would never k*ll Dante! I...

We drank to our truce.

I made a vow.

The Bartolos never back down

on their word.

So... so...

who k*lled my Dante?!

And that's how

we got here, moms.

Uh, me under house arrest,

Sean's dead, Dante's dead.

Emily's acting... creepy.

I mean, creepier than normal.

I don't know why anybody would think

I would want to k*ll Dante.

Just...

Yes, thank you for the suggestion.

I've actually checked.

I can't climb down off the balcony.

I...

Yes, I know.

Before you say it, I...

Hey, hey, hey, listen to me.

Miles was expelled from camp.

He's... he's what?

Expelled.

Excommunicated from

the Tribe of Minnetonka.

And yes, those are the words

that camp counselor Val used.

That woman is a cultural moron.

What happened?

He took a ski boat joyriding.

He doesn't know anything about boats.

How could he even...

- He hot-wired it.

- Great, yeah.

g*dd*mn Grand Theft Auto, I swear to God.

Some kids were making fun of your show,

and then

they dared him to steal the boat.

Perfect. This is great.

I'm in Capri, and my son's a felon,

and I'm under arrest.

- This-this is perfect.

- Okay, stop that.

I'm on my way to pick him up right now.

No, okay. Just tell me...

Wait, Stephanie,

did you say you're under arrest?

Stephanie? Stephanie?

Did you find a...

What is she doing here?

I'm here to help in whatever way I can.

- Uh-huh, I'll bet you are.

- Our investigation is ongoing.

Until it's finished, I'm going to need

your passport and your phone.

No, my-my, uh, kid

just got expelled from camp,

so I-I can't be offline.

Of course, yes.

We noticed that these murders

have increased

your subscriber numbers significantly.

Just heartless and cold

to profit off this kind of tragedy.

When did you get so invested, Aunt Linda?

Wh... When you ruined

my niece's life for the second time.

Are you an idiot?

Are you not following

what's going on here?

Your phone, please.

And your passport.

Emily knows I didn't do this.

I've never even held a g*n.

Well, one time.

That was different. They were blanks.

You leave her alone.

Opportunists like you aren't gonna

take advantage of her again.

She made me come here.

Don't even bother.

From what I understand,

you've always been jealous of Emily.

You probably have some sick,

twisted crush on her.

Shame on you!

Your passport.

You will be hearing from my lawyers

as soon as I figure out

how to get a lawyer.

First you will need someone

willing to represent

the woman accused of k*lling

the head of Familia Versano.

Leave us.

I'd like Stephanie alone.

Hon, you don't have to do this.

No, I want to.

Signor Lucchese, please.

I'd hate to have to involve

my new mother-in-law and family.

You may go now.

We'll... be right outside.

Please be careful.

Thanks.

- Take this.

- Mm.

Corpse Bride, are you for real?

Is she for real?

The moral condemnations

and her folksy little sayings?

I know you two know each other.

I don't know if you're working together.

What is the game here?

This isn't a game for me, Stephanie.

All I ever wanted was

someone who was mine.

But you took that from me.

Time and time again.

And you tell me I don't get to feel pain.

What are you talking about?

What-what are you doing?

I had to tell

Detective Lucchese everything.

I'm sorry. I couldn't keep lying.

That has never been

a problem for you before.

The key to the shackles

of deceit is truth.

And what truth is that exactly?

The night Sean died,

you were late to the pool.

I wasn't late. You were early.

I thought you were doing it to protect me

'cause he was so awful.

But you were just using me.

For your sick revenge against poor Sean.

I didn't k*ll Sean.

You know I didn't k*ll Sean.

I didn't think you would do it again,

but then you k*lled my Dante.

What is happening?

Is this why you brought me to the wedding?

What are you doing?

Stephanie, please stop.

Jesus Christ.

Stop.

You hurt me, but I'm trying to help you.

Just tell the police everything.

They already know.

You can confess,

they'll make a deal,

and you can see your son again.

I'm doing this for you.

You told me once you loved me,

and I take that kind of declaration

very seriously.

I never s... I never said I loved you.

Who are you?

You broke my heart, Stephanie.

You're not Emily.

Oh, you sound crazy.

You're not Faith.

I saw Faith's body at the morgue.

- You can't be Faith.

- No, stop.

Stop. You're scaring me.

You're scaring me now,

and I don't like to be scared.

The police are right outside.

I know.

Emily!

Emily!

I know who you are.

You think I don't know who you are?!

I f*cking know who you are!

Signora Smothers,

you will remain under house arrest

for your own safety,

in the event the Versanos overreact.

Oh, she tried to k*ll me.

Get the f*ck off me!

What have you done?!

Don't let her get away with it!

You think I don't know what's happening?!

- I f*cking know what's happening!

- Don't!

f*cking psycho!

What have you done? What have you done?!

Who are you?

You work for the Mafia?

You're here to k*ll me?

I am to say "Irene sent me."

- Irene?

- Yeah.

Oh, God.

Uh, are you FBI, too?

No. She paid me money.

- And screw the police.

- Yeah.

They arrest my husband. And for what?

He doesn't steal those chickens.

Just borrows.

Got it.

She will meet you here.

Great. Um, what's the plan

to get me out of here?

'Cause the cops are right outside.

I don't know.

She only paid me to deliver the note.

Okay.

Where's your cart?

In the hall next to the police.

Um, grab your cart,

and-and I'll get inside,

and you can just roll me past.

Okay. Mm-hmm.

- Okay.

- Why not?

Okay, um, so I need to hide,

and this is see-through.

This is my cart.

You can hide in it. Look.

Debatable.

Um, do you have one

that is not see-through?

Wow, um...

uh, do you understand English?

Of course I do.

I'm talking to you right now.

So true.

Um... okay.

I need a cart that you can't see through

so I can hide.

All of this for ten euro.

What are you looking at?

Go clean something.

Maybe I'll go steal me a nice chicken.

There's a room I need

to find with an old lady in silk pajamas.

Fake hair? Drinks all day?

Yeah.

Come with me.

Speak English!

No one can understand what you're saying.

Bruce!

Bruce!

The television is broken.

Hello.

Hello, Margaret.

Oh.

You're Hope's friend, aren't you?

That insurance agent.

I'm still waiting on that check.

Uh, right.

Uh, the... the check's coming.

Oh, yeah, the check is on the way.

Um...

Oh, no, don't...

I-I wanted to ask you about

Hope and Faith's triplet, Charity.

The one who didn't survive.

She's here.

I saw her.

Just creeping around

in the shadows in a bad wig.

But I saw her.

I saw her.

And I just know

that that's my little angel.

Why does everyone think she died?

Because she did die.

And Linda sent her soul to Hell.

Oh. Oh, oh, no. No, thank you.

- Have a look.

- Oh, it's...

That's really cool.

You know, Linda delivered the triplets.

Hope and Faith first, and...

and then the third baby

came out dead.

Cord wrapped around her neck.

The other two were holding it.

They strangled my Charity in the womb.

Their own sister. Can you imagine?

Then she took that poor little pure body

and cremated it

before I even had a chance to see her.

You know, before I could

even call a priest

to bless her poor departed soul,

she was gone.

Linda stole the baby.

But now

God has brought Charity back to me.

He went down into Hell,

and he brought her back.

You saw her.

And Charity will visit

God's wrath on Linda

for not giving her a Christian burial.

She is the hammer of the Almighty!

Boop.

Hmm. They're gonna punish Hope, too.

Yeah, you'll see.

You'll see.

Uh, I need your phone.

Your, uh, "telephone-o."

I know what a telephone is.

Okay, it's an "emergencia."

Stop speaking Italian!

- I know what...

- Oh, my God.

Grazie! Grazie!

Please! It's mine!

That's my telephone!

All my secrets are in there!

Move.

Find her.

sh*t.

No, I know that they're Capri bells,

but that little

jingling noise is gonna

drive me up a f*cking wall,

- so do you have anything more silent?

- Vicky. Vicky.

Yes.

Vicky. Oh, my God.

Ben!

Stephanie, where are you?

- I've been calling.

- I'm under arrest.

Or I-I was.

Or I... well, I escaped, basically.

The Mob is sort of after me, so...

The FBI is aware

of your situation

and prepared to get you out of there.

Oh, thank God. Okay.

Now, look, Linda McLanden

is extremely dangerous.

She's connected

to several unexplained deaths,

all of them men she's conned.

Now, the FBI, they got somebody out there.

Yeah, uh, Agent Irene Walker.

Not their finest.

Well, she's aware of your situation.

She's gonna get you to a safe house

Interpol has set up on the island.

She'll keep you safe

until we can get you out of there.

No, I-I'm going to meet her right now.

Great. I'll let Interpol know. Oh.

- Call me when you're in the house.

- I will. I will. I will. I will. I will.

Stephanie!

Hey. I'm here.

- You see her?

- Oh, holy sh*t,

this woman's gonna get me k*lled.

Okay, if I don't die,

- I'll talk to you later.

- Steph, what is she...

Oh, my God, cute sweater.

Did you buy that here?

Could you be drawing

more attention to yourself?

Oh, sorry. I'm just so glad you're alive.

Me, too.

Um, Linda is working

with Emily's dead sister Char...

well, uh, she... Charity's not dead.

She's pretending to be Emily,

and they're trying to frame me,

- and so now the Mob is after me.

- Hey, it is okay. It is ok...

- We need to keep a low profile.

- Listen. Hey.

- You're in good hands.

- Okay.

Okay? Let's get to the safe house.

You can tell me all about it.

- Okay.

- I've got your back...

Did you bite your tongue?

Oh, I hate when that happens.

Are you okay?

Knife! Knife!

Knife! Knife!

m*rder*r! m*rder*r!

Oh,

you f*cking b*tch. No!

m*rder*r!

I didn't do anything!

I didn't do anything...

Are you serious?

Ay.

Linda, why has no one come

to fix the television?

I don't know. It's f*cking Italy!

That's all I'm hearing.

It's driving me crazy.

I thought maybe Bruce

could fix it or Hope's friend,

but no, they're gone.

Wait, was Stephanie just here?

Listen.

Popeye sounds like he's speaking Italian.

Margaret!

Focus that gin-pickled brain of yours.

I need to know: Was Stephanie just here?

I just said she was.

Did you talk to her?

Yeah, there's something off

about that girl,

and it's not just because

she's a terrible insurance agent.

- Margaret, what... Shut up!

- Is she 12?

Did you talk to her?

What did you say to her?

What did you say?

Well, I told her everything.

- What do you mean?

- All about Charity.

Yeah.

She knows what you did,

and she's gonna tell the whole world,

and then so will I,

and then you are going

to rot in Hell, Linda.

That's unfortunate, Margaret.

God knows what you did to Charity,

and he will punish you.

sh*t.

You should thank me.

I gave Charity a much better life

than she would've had with you.

And unlike your girls,

she never ran away from me.

Kids are valuable in my line of work, sis.

Everyone trusts kids.

And there's nothing

like working with family.

Right?

Gosh darn it.

Who's there?

Mrs. Versano, hi.

Um...

Uh, this is a really nice... basement.

It's a little spinny, but, um...

Look, I think there's been...

a huge mistake.

- Okay?

- Yes.

You k*lled my only son.

I didn't. I swear to God, I didn't.

I didn't even know him.

Why would I k*ll him?

That's what I'm here to find out.

Um, what's that?

Whatever that is, I think, um,

we don't need it, you know?

We can just talk.

Sodium thiopental.

Okay, truth serum is not...

I-I sort of work with law enforcement,

and that's not gonna do anything

other than get me

really f*cking high, so...

Okay!

My compliments to the chef.

Yes.

It works quickly.

You said it, sister.

- I used it on my husband once.

- No way.

Yeah, to find out who he was f*cking.

But there were so many names.

He wouldn't stop.

Do you want to know who I'm f*cking?

It's this guy named nobody.

Nada.

- Niente.

- Let's stick to the subject.

Okay. Okay.

So I was seeing this guy in the city,

and then when I didn't put him

in the acknowledgements for my book,

he just broke it off.

Can you believe that?

Why did you k*ll my son?!

I didn't.

It was Emily's triplet, Charity.

She's been here the whole time.

Can you believe that?

I think she k*lled Sean, too.

And an FBI agent. Mm.

A really stupid one.

Hey, I read your book.

Tabloid garbage.

I know the triplet is dead.

Oh, my God.

Everyone's a critic.

No, no, no.

Charity was dead, but she wasn't.

She was, um, she was the opposite of dead.

She was undead. Not like a zombie.

She was just, um,

she was just, like, alive.

She probably k*lled Emily.

- Aw.

- This jumble of words makes no sense!

What aren't you telling me?

You're holding something back.

Please don't make me say.

Tell me.

Tell me.

Okay.

I knew I would be the best PTA president,

so I stuffed the ballot box with my name,

but it shouldn't be a popularity contest,

and Stacy's had it out for me...

No, we're talking about Olivia!

Emily.

Hope McLanden.

Whatever f*cking name she uses.

I did it.

I k*lled him.

I knew you k*lled my Dante.

No.

Not Dante.

No.

Dante was so handsome.

I would've licked ice cream off his face.

No, I k*lled the gym teacher.

I mean, I didn't k*ll him,

but he k*lled himself because of me.

If I'm being honest,

I've k*lled so many men.

I don't know what to do. They die.

They die if I love them.

They die if I don't love them.

I can't do anything.

I can't keep people alive.

I can't even solve crimes anymore.

I just want it to stop.

Enough!

I know you had an arrangement

with Emily to k*ll my Dante.

Oh.

Was it for the money?

Money?

Or... or...

do you just have some sick obsession

with that awful woman

who brought you into my life?

I am not obsessed with her.

I don't know why

everybody keeps saying that.

No.

No, I wouldn't

take money from Emily.

She's so... she's so sort of...

twisty and confusing.

It's like she's always sort of

very serious, and then she'll laugh.

You know that thing? I don't know.

I don't think she knows

what she's doing now

'cause she's not the one doing it.

'Cause she's probably dead.

Keep up, sister.

It's unbelievable.

She is useless.

Did you see that

black dress she was wearing?

I was like, you...

it was just doing a lot, you know?

When she walked in the room,

she was carrying a parasol.

- Girl, we are inside.

- She's crazy.

k*ll her.

And make sure the body is never found.

What'd she say?

Oh. Yeah. Okay.

Plastic sheeting makes sense.

That's smart, you know?

Makes cleanup a breeze.

But she really mumbled that last part,

so maybe you want

to double-check what she said,

'cause you might have

misheard her, you know?

I-I mean, up to you guys,

but that's sort of the thing about m*rder.

No takesies backsies.

What's happening?

Oh!

I'm fine!

I just tipped over.

What's going on?

I can't see what's happening.

All righty.

- You good? You good?

- Oh, of course it's you.

You are so obsessed with me!

Stop! I need space.

You're being really clingy.

Did you know Charity's alive?

She's k*lling everybody

you ever loved, girl.

I'm aware.

Oh, thank you.

Are you okay?

I know you're here 'cause you need me,

'cause I'm so smart and I'm so pretty.

'Cause Emily loves Stephanie!

Glad to have you back.

You enjoying that truth serum?

Oh. Wow!

- Let's get out of here.

- Okay.

- Come on.

- No. No. No!

- You could be Charity. No.

- We have to go.

Oh. You could be Charity.

- Prove that you're Emily. No.

- Stephanie, Stephanie.

Say something only Emily would know.

- Prove you're Emily!

- We do not have time for this.

Prove it!

Brother-fucker, I told you

we do not have time for me

to detail the basement sex

you had with your half brother

who may or may not be

the father of your child.

I pray to God every day

that Miles doesn't see

a commercial for 23andMe.

All right, all right! We get it!

This isn't how you talk

to somebody you're in love with.

Why are we still standing here? Let's go.

Let's go.

How did you do that?

Prison, b*tch.

Come on. Come on.

- Oh, my God.

- Let's go.

- Why did they bring me to the ocean?

- Yeah, no, let's walk.

Yeah, face forward. Come on.

Come on, come on, come on, come on.

Oh, all right.

I think we need to

pull over or I'm gonna puke on your head.

Oh, God. Okay. No, no, no. Don't do that.

Don't-don't do that.

- Oh, God.

- You done?

It's not like we have the Mob after us.

I mean...

the good news is

I'm not high anymore, mostly.

Where the hell have you been?

I'm very glad Charity didn't k*ll you.

Oh, yeah, no, no.

There was no chance of that.

She, uh, likes me too much.

What does that mean?

Uh, I'm gonna need to ease in to this one.

That night after I, uh, I left you

at the pool, Aunt Linda was in my room.

Turns out I come from

a long line of con artists,

and Aunt Linda was tired of the hustle.

She wanted a way out, and she saw

my situation as her retirement plan.

She showed up

to blackmail me and Dante for $20 million.

Blackmail you for what?

Uh...

well, I guess it's not really

a secret to keep

now that he's dead.

Um...

when Dante and I first met,

you know, he was just another customer,

wanted a sympathetic ear.

Then he kept coming back, you know?

He'd tell me stories,

and we became friends.

And one day, he told me about

his great love,

the one that he could never be with.

The one his mom might even k*ll him over

if she ever found out.

You know, because of his last name.

Bartolo.

Matteo?

Yeah.

Holy sh*t.

Yeah, I make a pretty cute beard.

You know, they needed someone flashy

to draw eyes away from them,

so, you know, there I was.

Bathroom, 20 seconds.

Knock twice.

They've been together

for 15 years, nobody knew?

Yeah. Yeah, it was just this, you know,

small, beautiful thing

in a really f*cked-up world.

So he reads you're in jail,

reconnects with you, and...

'cause... 'cause you're his way out.

I was the only person he ever told.

So you cut a deal,

his lawyers get you out of jail,

and he and Matteo... mm.

Yeah, they can be together

without triggering a Mob w*r.

And obviously Aunt Linda

didn't give a sh*t about any of that.

The McLandens only care about money.

So you told her to f*ck off, obviously.

But why did she k*ll Sean

before you'd even turned her down?

Yeah, I, uh...

yeah, I wondered the same thing

until Charity showed up

in my room the next day.

I-I honestly,

I couldn't believe it, you know?

There she was...

this person that I thought was dead

or, you know, didn't exist

was just standing in front of me

like a, like a creepy

Victorian ghost child.

Linda told me

that I have two sisters

but that they didn't want me,

and I knew it wasn't true.

No, that... We didn't know.

Do you know that I had no friends

and that she schooled me by myself

and raised me by myself

and I only had them?

All 'cause Linda needed my help

with her work,

ever since I was little.

And I didn't want to do it, but I had to.

- Oh.

- So I did.

But they would help me

so I wasn't so alone.

They did a good job.

Linda k*lled so many people.

Those poor, poor men.

And I hated it.

Um, Charity.

Until I didn't.

- What can I do for you now?

- Nothing.

I just want to see you.

I always knew that you would be my savior.

That both of my sisters would be my savior

and I might save you, too.

But then I heard that you k*lled her.

Why did you k*ll Faith?

- Why did you do that?

- Charity, y-you-you need to go.

Why did you take Faith from me?

I would've kept her.

Y-You're gonna destroy everything.

- I have a plan. I'm gonna fix everything.

- You-you don't need to fix anything.

I'm gonna fix everything. I forgive you.

- I forgive you.

- Okay.

I won't let you go ever again.

Yeah, I love you, too.

Okay. Need to make sure...

Oh, g*dd*mn it.

that we're together always.

Don't worry.

I saved you from Sean,

and tonight I'll save you from Dante, too.

Do you know I know the moment

you k*lled our sister?

I woke up screaming

because that water was so cold.

I could feel her pain.

But I could also feel yours.

Because...

I'm not your sister, I'm you.

And you're me.

And we're just one.

We don't need Dante or Sean or Stephanie.

We don't need a woman or a man.

We just need each other.

I'm only ever gonna make you feel good.

So good.

So good because it makes me feel good.

Do you want to see what I mean?

Blink if that's okay.

Yay. We're gonna love this.

We can feel so good...

at the same time.

Do you love it?

We're gonna have this forever.

Always.

So...

Charity's a sister-fucker?

You couldn't wait to say that, could you?

I mean, what was I gonna do, not say it?

- To you of all people?

- Well, I mean, you know,

that might be the definition of too soon.

Are you okay, by the way?

Sorry. That was really dark.

- Oh.

- We kind of skipped over that.

Thank you for your concern. Yeah.

- It happens.

- Well...

Eh, it never f*cking happens.

Okay, so she locked you up, and you've

just been there this entire time?

Yeah, you know, she-she drugged me,

put up a "do not disturb" sign,

and then she went through with my wedding.

Honestly, the thing

that's most upsetting to me

in all of this is that...

is that Dante died

thinking that that was me.

You know, that I'm the one

that k*lled him.

Anyway, for some reason, she didn't

show up to drug me this morning, so...

Yeah, 'cause she was k*lling an FBI agent

and framing me for it.

So what do we do now?

We get Nicky

and we get the f*ck out of here.

That's your plan?

Yeah.

Your suggestion is to just keep running

forever with a ten-year-old son?

I know you brought me here

for revenge or as bait

or you want to f*cking k*ll me

or something,

but now the Mafia

and the actual FBI want my head.

I didn't have to be part of this.

I shouldn't be here.

You could've just left me alone!

Why am I part of this?!

Why the f*ck am I here?!

Baby, you think the whole time

that everybody wants to k*ll you?

I don't want to k*ll you.

All these people want my head.

You know, and if my plan didn't work out,

which, you know, obviously,

there was a very good chance

that it didn't,

I knew that if something happened to me...

I'd need to figure it out.

You're my knight

in shining f*cking armor, Stephanie.

That's why you're here.

That's nice.

Well, it's true.

So, yeah, yeah, you know,

I don't have a better plan.

I'm all out.

But you, you always do.

You're ten steps ahead of everyone,

so what do you got?

'Cause I am not in the mood

to k*ll another sister.

Oh, someone should stitch that

on a pillow.

Okay. sh*t, let me just think.

Just give me a second.

Hey, why are you... Where's your phone?

Why are you live right now?

What are you talking about?

Hello, mothers.

Emily here.

I'm sure you're all expecting Stephanie,

but as some of you may have heard,

she's running from what she's done,

and I need to find her now.

So if any of you happen to see her,

please tell her.

Stephanie, you're like family to me.

And I need my sister back.

I can still feel you.

Can you feel me?

Aw, sister-fucker.

I must go now, but first,

say hi, angel.

My sweet boy, say hi. Say hello.

Okay, now I'm in the mood

to k*ll a sister.

He's so sleepy.

He told me that

being away from me felt like

falling off a cliff into oblivion.

He's such a sweet boy.

Okay.

Time to cut out

this rebellious streak of his.

We have somewhere to be.

We hope you'll meet us there.

Tiberius.

- Here, take this.

- Okay.

Come on, let's go.

And play it cool. That b*tch is crazy.

Hi.

This is really f*cked up, Linda.

Oh, he'll never remember any of this.

Charity really learned a lot from that

lovely pharmacist we had our time with.

Her knowledge of chemicals

really changed the game for me.

dr*gs make life so much easier,

don't you think?

You know I'm gonna k*ll both of you

for f*cking with my kid, right?

I hate to tell you, Emily,

but Nicky couldn't tell the difference

between his real mother and

her dead sister, even before the dr*gs.

Children are so adaptable.

And they make perfect props

for con artists.

I mean, who wouldn't trust a woman

with an adorable child in tow?

Isn't that what you've been

your whole life, Charity?

No.

Just a little prop?

To make your fake mother money?

Oh, yeah, poor Charity.

She really missed out

on a charmed life with old Margaret.

She could've grown up

in a f*cking nuthouse

with a drug addict

and a m*rder*r as her siblings.

Oh, eat a c*ck, Linda.

What do you want?

Seriously.

How do you think the two of you

get out of this?

The FBI's onto you.

One of their agents

just got m*rder*d by your daughter.

Charity, what the f*ck?

Oh, yeah.

Yeah, and...

Dante's dead, so are-are you

gonna blackmail a corpse?

No, my blackmailing days are over.

They died with Dante.

And blackmail's such a Band-Aid

on bigger problems anyway.

The long-term solutions are the best ones.

And the Versanos have so much more money

than $20 million.

Oh, the...

I'm sorry, that's, uh, that's it?

That's your plan?

You're gonna steal from the Mob?

No, I don't have to, darling.

Charity married Dante.

And everybody thinks she's you, Emily.

She's part of the family.

His powerful widow Emily.

She'll take his place at the top,

take care of her dear Aunt Linda

and her beloved Nicky,

and we'll all live happily ever after.

Yeah, except, uh, Portia f*cking hates me,

and she'll never give you

that sort of power, so...

Well, you'd be amazed what a changed

person you've been since Dante died.

A totally different woman.

Mm.

Whom Portia has become quite fond of.

Well, other than the fact

that your insanely jealous

maid of honor was the one

who k*lled her son.

But when you bring her Stephanie's body

to prove yourself to the family,

then all will be forgiven.

Not bad, huh?

- It's pretty perfect, Linda...

- Mm-hmm.

except for one thing.

Emily has to die, Charity.

No, no, Stephanie, only you do.

Right. Just after Emily.

- Goodbye, my dear niece.

- No.

- Only Stephanie.

- What?

No, Hope doesn't die.

Charity, what the f*ck?

Only Stephanie. Hope stays alive.

Yeah, and how does that work, nutjob?

It does. Hope stays alive with me because

we are one.

No, she's right. Emily can't die.

It's true.

Charity and I are meant

to be together always.

Hey, f*ck off and stay out of this,

both of you!

Charity, do not get weird on me, not now.

I'm not letting you k*ll my soulmate.

Jesus Christ, you only just met her!

And there can't be two of you.

It doesn't make any sense.

- There's only one of us.

- You're gonna...

You're gonna blow the whole thing.

Get... No! f*ck!

- Jesus!

- Go. Go.

How is this f*cking happening?!

Are you kidding me?!

Why is this happening?!

I will k*ll all three of you if I have to!

g*dd*mn it!

This plan is foolproof.

You think it was easy to come up with it

after psycho f*ck over here k*lled Dante?

No, but I did it!

And it's a great plan!

And it's gonna happen right now!

Stealth mode, b*tch!

No! Charity, give me the g*n!

No! Charity!

Oh, sh*t!

She'll be okay.

But not you.

No, no, no.

Charity, no.

Stephanie... Stephanie doesn't die, okay?

She has to.

Because she took you away from me

and she'll do it again.

And when she hurts you, she hurts me.

She hurt me, too.

No, Stephanie doesn't hurt people, okay?

You and I, we-we-we... we do.

It's what the McLandens do... Margaret,

Linda, my father, Faith, all of us.

That's-that's why we...

It's why we belong together.

It's why we deserve each other, you know?

Come here. I missed you.

Come here.

Oh, Charity, you k*lled so many people.

I did it all for you.

You shouldn't have done that.

That-that wasn't right.

You know, we can't let Stephanie

pay for that, can we?

No, we can't.

I mean, I can't,

and-and you and I, we're one, right?

So, together we can fix this.

You know, maybe you can

do something for me, for us.

For us.

To make it better.

Okay.

I would do anything for us.

And with us today

is Stephanie Smothers,

whose book Dying for Love:

A k*ller in Capri is number one

on The New York Times Best Seller list.

It's the follow-up to her first book

The Faceless Blonde,

which has also seen

quite a boost in sales.

It's a pleasure to be here.

Emily Nelson...

or Hope McLanden, I should say...

quite a fascinating character study.

Yeah. Um, Emily lived a life

stranger than fiction.

I'm just glad that she's back

in custody where she belongs,

and I'm glad I could help

bring her to justice.

Again.

Right. Again.

We'll have more later

on the arrest

and extradition of Emily Nelson

for the bizarre murders

of her ex-husband, new husband,

aunt, mother, and FBI agent Irene Walker

while on the island of Capri.

Prosecution attorneys say Ms. Nelson

has made a complete confession.

Stephanie, you were also recently proven

to have been right

about the suspect you identified

in what turned out to be

an international child pornography ring.

I've got to know, how do you go

from shortbread recipes to crime solving?

Um, I think you'll find I'm a woman

who's full of surprises, Jake.

How else could I have ended up

on your wonderful program?

Oh, honey, you are

really crushing this interview.

Aw, thank you. You're getting soft on me.

No math on an empty stomach, guys.

God, my mom's such a dork.

No way, man. Your mom's a badass.

Totally.

Stephanie, you look great on television.

Ms. Nelson's lawyers

have abandoned her appeal

in the case of the m*rder

of her father Stanley and sister Faith.

If convicted, she will be

serving multiple life sentences.

And we'll be right back.

Jake Tapper could get it.

- Hello?

- Hey, it's your friend in hiding.

Yeah, I know. How are you?

Oh, I'm... you know, I'm okay.

Better now that sister-fucker's locked up.

Uh, I have something to ask you.

Uh, you know, just a...

simple favor for old times' sake.

Anything.

He's never gonna have

a decent childhood with me, so...

promise me you'll raise Nicky

so he doesn't grow up like I did.

You know, until I see him again.

Yeah, I promise.

Um, see you around?

Yeah.

I'll be keeping an eye on you.

I'm always hiding in plain sight,

brother-fucker.

Will you be normal for once?

Just say goodbye.

I'll talk to you later.

I know what you did...

Hope.

You don't get to be my age

as a woman in this business

without knowing everything.

Deep in my heart, I knew...

you would never have hurt my Dante.

I will keep your secret.

He was...

He was such a good friend to me.

I-I really...

I really loved him.

I... I did.

Mm. We all did.

But my son is still dead because of you.

However, I consider you

to be part of the family now.

And I expect a lot from family.

So...

because of this, I have...

a simple favor...

to ask of you.

How simple?
