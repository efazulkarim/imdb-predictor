[Neurolink powers up]

- He is alive?
- [chief technician] He is.

Just.

The Rue Kali was exhausted by the jump.

But we were able to force a little more
energy out of the ungrateful b*tch

to heal the admiral.

- [switch clicks]
- [Neurolink powers up]

[Neurolink hums]

He had no brain function
for quite a while.

We don't know how bad the damage was.

We'll know what's left of him
when we bring him out of the chrysalis.

[ominous music plays]

[liquid gurgles]

[cable whirs]

[machine beeps]

[breathes heavily]

[gasps for air]

His airways are clear.

- He's breathing on his own.
- [Noble coughs]

Admiral.

Admiral, it's me.

Cassius?

[Cassius] Yes.

Where am I?

You're aboard your ship, sir.

The King's Gaze.

When we heard your ship was down,
we had the Kali jump us here to Gondival.

We have been holding in orbit
for your recovery, sir.

And thank the old gods,
our prayers have been answered.

Cassius, listen to me.

She's on Veldt.

Who?

Who is?

[coughs]

[inhales deeply]

The Scargiver.

She's on Veldt.

Set course for Veldt.

[Cassius] Yes, Admiral.

It will be done.

[dramatic choral music plays]

[electricity crackles]

[somber music plays]

- [uraki bellows]

[female singer vocalizes]

[uraki bellows]

I'm Hagen.

This is Den.

We welcome you to our humble village.

You must be tired and hungry.

And thirsty.

Well, we have prepared food
and drink for you in the Longhouse.

Come on. You'll see what great hosts
my people can be.

Let's bring these urakis to the stable.

They've come back.

Well, how do they look?

Strong, like warriors, I guess.

- How many of them?
- Six.

- With Kora and Gunnar.
- [Aris] Six.

It won't matter how strong they are,
will it?

[transmitter burrs rhythmically]

- [knobs click]
- [frequency tunes]

You can't be here.

[radio buzzes]

[radio warbles]

[frequency tunes]

Commander Cassius.

Soldier. All is as it should be, I trust.

Yes, sir. All is on target.

Nothing out of the ordinary?

- No, sir.
- [Cassius] Very well.

Ensure that the harvest
is brought in as planned,

and ready for our arrival
in five days' time.

[gasps]

Five days?

[tense music plays]

[foreboding music plays]

[scanner beeps]

[FLIR trills]

They have gone into the Longhouse.

Set up a transmitter.

See if you can find some firewood.

Understood.

This spot should do nicely.

Move out.

[scanner beeps]

[foreboding music continues]

Come. [clears throat]

Now, please eat.
You must all be very hungry.

Okay.

Our villagers have prepared
a bounty of food and drink

to show their fealty
and gratitude at your arrival.

But where is everyone?

[hesitates] How would you feel?

The lot of you, if you were not capable
of standing to protect your own home?

[Hagen] Mmm-hmm.

If you had to ask others
to lay down their lives for you.

[Milius] They should see there's no shame
in our being here.

To swallow their pride to ask for help,

that is bravery itself.

- Thank you.
- Yes.

And as it happens,
nobody need lay down their lives.

A defense won't be necessary.

- Admiral Noble's dead.
- [Hagen] What?

- He's dead?
- Really?

[laughs]

You need to say it again.
He doesn't believe it.

- [Hagen exclaims happily]
- He's dead.

[laughter]

You do not believe that they will return?

[Kora] I don't.

It's Imperial protocol
in the event of an admiral's death

to return to the Motherworld at once.

Then we owe you
an even deeper debt of gratitude...

[Aris] You're wrong.

I just received word.

[sighs] They'll be here in five days.

Is that true?

- [Den] Five days?
- Yes.

I thought you said
that you k*lled Admiral Noble.

I did k*ll him. His body was smashed
on the rocks. He is dead.

It's against protocol to come without
an admiral to command the ship, right?

That is true.

But death is not always deterrent enough
for the designs of the Motherworld.

They must be more in need of this grain
than we could have known.

- Hagen?
- Yes.

Call your villagers. Let me talk to them.

Okay.

- [villagers murmur]
- [somber music plays]

Dark days lie ahead of us all.

When the time comes...

we may all have to stand together,

in battle, as brothers.

To succeed,

there must be trust between us.

In time, we will teach you how to fight.

But first, you must show us your strength.

The way of the land.

If we do not act quickly,
the destruction of your village...

is all but assured.

Now, how long does it take
to bring in your crop?

Half a cycle around Mara.

No, it must be done in three days' time.

- What?
- It can't be done.

[villagers murmur]

[Titus] We need
every man and woman who's able.

The grain is our most powerful w*apon.

Without it,

they are liable to blow us
out of existence from orbit.

If we bring it in fast,

we can use it,
both as a bartering tool and shield.

I thought you said
they wouldn't negotiate.

[Kora] Admiral Noble wouldn't have.

But whoever the second in command is
just might be willing to make a trade.

That's right.

Now rest well.

The work begins at dawn.

[Hagen] You heard the man.

Dawn.

[villagers murmur]

[somber music plays]

You think they'll learn
to trust one another?

They're frightened...

of outsiders, the battle to come,
for their lives.

Trust? I don't know.

I just hope they all have the courage
to stand and fight, if it comes to it.

I had no idea
what it would be like to fight.

How much it would scare me.

- You are afraid to die.
- [chuckles]

[chuckles] That's okay. Everyone is.

I didn't even think about dying
in the moment.

If you would've asked me before
how I feel,

I would have said I'd be petrified.

And I was scared.

The most afraid I've ever been in my life.

What was it you were so afraid of?

If it wasn't death?

It was you.

It was losing you.

[Kora breathes heavily]

[Kora moans]

[Gunnar pants]

[both chuckle]

What Noble said...

about you being the most wanted criminal
in the known universe.

[Gunnar scoffs]

You don't become that
simply by running away.

[Kora sighs]

You remember how I told you
I was raised by Balisarius?

[Gunnar] Mmm-hmm.

Regent of the Imperium?

And how I was the bodyguard
to the Princess Issa?

Yes.

And that you were a decorated warrior.

Friend of the royal family.

What happened to them?

Under the healing influence
of his daughter,

the King had begun to see
many things in a different light.

[bell tolls]

[Kora] Word had reached him
that his most celebrated general

would fall without honor.

[King] What have you done?!

[Kora] And that his main weapons
were slaughter and cruelty.

So the King knew
he must not let him retain his command.

He should have destroyed Balisarius
and then me along with him.

But the King loved him,

and even through his rage,
saw him as a son.

[ominous choral music plays]

[music builds]

And so for his sins,
he was made a senator.

But for all his ferociousness
on the b*ttlefield,

there was nothing compared
to his skill and cunning as a politician.

[sinister music plays]

[Senate applauds]

[Senate cheers]

Because that is what it means
to be a true soldier of the Realm!

[Kora] And in the echoing
marble halls of the Senate

did he find his true calling.

[Senate cheers]

[Balisarius]
But still I would give my life...

No, no, no, I would give my f*cking soul

to protect our home from the darkness
that creeps towards us, my friends!

[indistinct chatter]

Ah, daughter, the news is dire.

I've learned that
the King plans to abdicate

and pass the kingdom onto the princess.

He also plans to disband
the Empire and execute the generals.

He said that, um,

Issa had looked into his eyes
and forgiven him,

but that now, you must make things right.

If what you say is true,
Issa will rule with wisdom and reason.

Yes.

That all may be true,

but when the cleansing begins,
you and I will be the first ones to go.

We can't allow that, can we?

The Realm is more than you
or I or some little girl.

And it will not be sacrificed
on the guilt of a spineless king

who, instead of ruling
in this blood-stained chamber,

would hide behind
the innocence of a child.

What can we do? It is the King's wish.

[Balisarius] The King is just a man.

Every general and half of the Senate
have their places because of me.

Listen, Arthelais, you are my family.

And when I am Regent Militarium,
you won't be the servant to the princess.

You will take her place.

[foreboding music plays]

[sighs]

[dramatic music plays]

[royal dropship whooshes]

[Kora] It was the dedication
of what would be

the last Dreadnought class battleship.

A symbolic end to an age of expansion.

In accordance with tradition,
the King would dedicate every ship,

but not this time.

This would be
the princess's first royal duty.

Her first official act.

The ship would be named Peacemaker
and bear her royal seal.

Make no mistake.

I was the loyal daughter
of my adopted father.

I could not betray him or defy him.

He had told me the princess must die.

And die she would.

[haunting choral music plays]

My father said he would not stand by

and watch this child
dismantle the w*r machine

we sacrificed so much for.

I had faith
that Balisarius would protect me

and the Empire he so loved.

[Guard of Honor] Attention!

[solemn adagio plays]

[King] Strange.

Something's wrong.

[door closes]

Balisarius.

Where is the Kali?
Why aren't the furnaces lit?

Balisarius, I am talking to you.

Answer me, man!

- Issa, run! Issa!

You bastard.

What are you waiting for, child? Do it!

[King whimpers]

- Do it.
- No.

- No, no.
- [Balisarius] Do it. k*ll her.

[exhales heavily]

- k*ll her!
- No!

Don't.

Seize her!

[Kora grunts]

There she is, gentlemen.

The assassin of the royal family.

An off-worlder.

[Kora cries out]

A cancer of ethnic impurities.

[shouts] m*rder*r.

- [senator] m*rder*r!
- [general] m*rder*r!

[Kora yells]

[breathes heavily]

[Kora] I fought my way to the shuttle.

And I've been living life
as an outlaw ever since.

I thought about letting them k*ll me
or just not fighting.

But somehow, the last words of the child...

Her forgiveness.

I felt the only way to honor her
was to run.

And try to be, I don't know...

more than a w*apon.

More than a w*apon.

It's what we're all trying to be.

It's what you are.

[Hagen] Good morning!

- [bell clangs]
- [Sam] Morning!

This is the wake-up call.
Wake up, everyone.

People, get up.

It's time to work.

Come on, you lazy people! Wake up!

- [groans]
- We don't have much time!

[Gunnar] Sorry, we're late.

Look who's here.

[Hagen] Gunnar.
Maybe you want to say a few words?

[Gunnar] Of course.

Sure. We have a few people here
who probably have never harvested grain...

Don't say anything.

- ...made sheaves...
- I can't say good morning?

...worked a scythe.

But we will welcome them.

And through our work together,
win favor with the spirit of soil

and guarantee the future abundance
of these sacred fields.

You all know your jobs.

Don't be afraid to personally approach
our guests and put them to work.

Let's get started!

- [villager 1] Yeah!
- [villager 2] Yeah!

Here you go.

Commander, I have
the chief medical technician.

Put him through.

- [hologram buzzes]
- [Noble] Release me!

[chief technician]
You should come down here.

[Noble] This is treason.
I command this ship.

By the old gods, I'll have each
and every one of you court marshalled!

I swear it! Every one of you will die!
I need none of you!

[chief technician] Come down here now.

On my way.

[Noble] I'll m*rder
every one of you myself!

[chief technician]
Admiral, you're not ready for this.

[Noble] I am still commander of this ship!

Why do you stand there
staring at me? Cowards!

- This is treachery!
- Welcome back, sir.

Are you ready to resume your command?

Yes, of course I am.
Now tell these idiots to release me.

[chief technician]
Sir, as I've already told you,

there are protocols before you can
be cleared to resume command.

Tests that need to be conducted
to see if you are mentally and...

- [chief technician groans]
- [sinister music plays]

Let me help you with your evaluation.
[grunts loudly]

[chief technician] Lord Admiral, please!

Unhook him!

How far are we from Veldt?

A few days, sir.

The Kali is still recovering
from our jump to you.

Admiral, my apologies
for the scar that was left

by this incompetent medical team.

I'm sure it can be removed.

No.

No, leave it.

She gave it to me.

When I deliver her to Balisarius

and her body is displayed
in the rotunda of the Senate,

I shall bare my chest.

And it will stand as a symbol

that it is I who brought to justice
the Scargiver,

as it is I that stands before my people
as a savior.

[comms signal beeps]

How's the harvest been going?
Any protests from the villagers?

[Aris] No, sir.

All is to schedule.

I've not seen Faunus or Marcus
during your reports.

They've been busy
driving the villagers, sir.

Getting that extra bit of work
out of them.

Very well.

[Aris] I believe it was your phrase, sir,

"Every child screaming,

every mother crying."

[Cassius] That is one of mine.

Yet I cannot take authorship.

I believe it originates
with our Regent Balisarius himself,

during his time as a fighting man.

And it is my honor to quote him.

And now mine.

The work has continued around the clock.

We should have
all the grain milled into flour

just in time for your arrival.

Excellent, Private.

And if the villagers
have held up their end,

maybe some mercy's in order.

These dogs deserve nothing but our boot.

Is that right?

We'll see...

when the job is done.

For the slain King.

For the slain King.

[Noble] Well, it's clear that what
the Hawkshaws are reporting is true.

That Marcus and Faunus
and the rest of their men are dead.

The Scargiver's among them.

And it seems our young private
has chosen a side.

What should we do, sir?

We wait for more information
from the Hawkshaws.

We let them think we know nothing.

Yes, sir.

[Gunnar] But here's the deal.

Once we finish the western fields,
we only need to mill the grain into flour.

[Tarak] Ten fields, we're halfway there.

[Gunnar] Well, yes, but...

[Tarak] Kind woman with silver hair...

- What was her name?
- [Kora] Hervor.

- Why?
- No reason.

- Listen.
- [Tarak] How many fields do we need...

- Listen.
- ...to get done tomorrow night?

[conversation stops]

I've never been one
for making confessions.

[Gunnar] Mmm.

Now we know what each of us must do.

You're all here because I want you to know
who the hell you're fighting with.

Everyone must share the truth.

I'll go first.

Sarawu.

[somber music plays]

The Regent Balisarius had sent me

and my ship as a show of force

to hover above the parliament of Sarawu,

so the choice of whether or not to vote
for independence from the Realm

would be obvious.

But the brave people of that world
defiantly voted for freedom,

and in answer, I was ordered
to open fire on the capitol.

I refused, and my ship was shot down.

Crawling from the wreckage,

we fought the forces of the Motherworld
till our g*ns were dry.

I knew my men would fight with me
to the death.

So I struck a deal.

My men's lives
for the surrender of my own.

I begged for mercy from the Regent
to spare them.

But mercy is not known
to the Regent Balisarius.

To punish me, my men were ex*cuted
before my eyes.

[crackling]

[somber music continues]

[g*n powers up]

[Titus yells]

The decision to defy Balisarius
had been mine alone.

Not a day passes that I don't think
of those men that died for me.

How my surrender betrayed their courage
and condemned them to their fate.

[somber music continues]

Never again.

I'll never surrender.

You should understand that today
before you choose to follow me tomorrow.

[somber music fades]

I've, uh, never fought in a battle
like the one that's coming.

But I was raised in a place
that was much like this.

My childhood made me understand that

the land is not the growing of the food
but the cultivation of the tribe itself.

When the ships appeared in the sky
above my world,

I looked to my tr*bal elders
for how we would respond.

They said, "What can we do
against the might of the Motherworld?"

They cowered
against the might of the Realm,

submitting and giving them everything
because they were too scared to fight.

Those who were too weak
or too old to work were k*lled.

The rest of us were scattered
to labor camps all over the universe.

Families torn apart.

It was as if my people never existed.

[ships approach]

[tense music plays]

[expl*si*n]

[tense music continues]

[expl*si*n]

[g*nf*re]

[music swells]

[Milius] My camp was liberated
by the Resistance.

And I found a new family
who showed me another way.

So when the time comes...

I'll give my life to protect this village
if need be.

To stand and die for a place to call home.

What more honorable end
could one ever hope for?

I had a life before.

[quavering] Long before...

[chuckles]

It seems.

[tense music plays]

We were a little fishing village.

The Imperium troops
slaughtered everything and everyone.

[melancholy music plays]

[lid thuds loudly]

We were a peaceful people.

But we hadn't always been.

Once, long ago...

we were a people of w*r.

I had never k*lled before,

never spilled blood,

until I spilled my own.

- My pain became rage.
- [gauntlet whirs]

[gauntlet clicks]

- And my rage became revenge.
- [gauntlet powers up]

But the bloodlust of my ancestors
still lived in those ancient gauntlets.

My blood awakened them.

They showed me how to fight.

And I was reborn.

But since that day,

I've been a creature of revenge.

And yes...

Yes, I will k*ll them.

None of us get to choose our parents.

And mine happened to be a king and queen.

My father, the King,

insisted on presenting our terms
to the armies of the Motherworld himself.

And their answer was to return his body
with the promise of invasion.

My mother told me then,
"A boy doesn't become a man

until his father dies."

"Then a prince becomes a king."

- [bennu screeches softly]
- That was the last time I cried.

Soon after,
their ships darkened our skies.

And my mother, for honor's sake,
she would not run.

[somber music plays]

[female singer vocalizes]

I wanted to stay to protect her,

but the Queen knew to preserve
the bloodline and the throne.

[distant explosions]

[somber music continues]

I lost my mother...

and my world that day.

I was smuggled off-planet,

hidden in a refugee transport
headed for a near bright star.

I ran for... for duty's sake,

for the preservation of a kingdom
and a bloodline that no longer exists.

I was robbed of my opportunity
to die defending them.

But no more.

When we finish here,

that is where I'll go.

Home.

To atone for my mistake
of misplaced honor.

[Titus] Kora.

We haven't heard from you.
What is your story?

I am a w*r orphan.

The discipline
of a military life suited me.

I served on a ship
very much like the King's Gaze.

Never having a family,
I believed I had found one.

That is until I arrived here on Veldt.

This place taught me what a home
and family could really be.

Anything else you'd like to add?

Hm?

No.

Sure?

How's the spring water?

[Tarak] What?

[Kora] For several days now,

Titus pretends to drink,

because he doesn't want us to know
how much he cares about the coming battle.

[cork opens]

[Kora scoffs]

It really is water.

[Milius chuckles]

Old stories can be hard to give up.

Yes, they can.

[Gunnar] Friends...

I can only say...

thank you for coming to this village,

and giving us hope.

Thank you.

Water.

Really, Titus?

And that's General Titus.

- Of course.
- To you.

- [punches]
- [Tarak groans, chuckles]

- [jolly folk music plays]
- [children giggle]

No, no, no.

Okay. Teach me.

Okay.

[Gunnar] Sorry.

[both grunt]

["From Far" plays]

[they chatter]

- [festive folk music plays]
- [all cheer]

[Den] I've still got it.

This is how we party.

- Thank you. Thanks.
- Enjoy yourselves.

I'm gonna get a drink first.

I noticed you were good doing the harvest.

I come from a world
that was much like this.

What became of it?

The very thing we came to prevent.

[bell clangs]

Everyone, if I could just...

I wanted to welcome our new friends.

I want to give you
these small gifts I've made.

I know you all come from places

much richer and more sophisticated
than here,

so I hope my gifts don't insult you
with their simplicity.

But I've made them with gratitude.

When I first saw
you all ride into our village,

I felt like General Titus
was like the mountains themselves.

Strong and unmoving.

Thank you.

[Sam] Tarak.

Your spirit is untamable...

[chuckles]

...but your nobility is undeniable.

Like the snow elk.

Thank you. Thank you.

[Sam] Our own Den, who I include

because he is
as the land beneath our feet,

rising to defend us.

Young Milius...

who shines as the sun upon our faces,

warming us and bringing us comfort,

steadfast and true.

Thank you.

[Sam] Nemesis.

Fierce as a storm
with its flashes of lightning,

but with its life-giving rain.

That is the source of life.

The storm is the mother of us all.

Thank you.

[Sam] Gunnar.

You are our heart.

You give us hope.

[Gunnar chuckles]

It's beautiful. Thank you.

[Kora kisses]

Look at this.

And Kora.

You are our guardian wolf
with bared teeth.

You stand between us and annihilation.

The strength of all of us together.

- I promise it's safe.

[Aris chuckles]

- [Aris howls]
- [Sam chuckles]

This is...

What was your world like?

More moons.

I wish you could've seen it.

It was beautiful.

Is it not beautiful here?

Yeah.

It is.

[Sam sighs]

If we survive,

when all of this is over...

will you stay?

Here, with me?

[chuckles]

If you'll have me, I'll stay.

[sentimental music plays]

[Hawkshaw] Oh no. Disgusting.

They're pressing their mouths together.

[growls]

- f*cking hell.
- [scanner beeps]

Oy! Get ready to transmit.

One moment.

Now.

[transmitter beeps]

It's ready.

- [frequency tunes]

Online.

Ah. Good.

[sighs]

[creatures chitter]

[bell tolls]

[Tarak chuckles]

- [bell tolls loudly]
- [grunts]

[villagers murmur]

[Titus] All right.

Today, we begin the preparation
for our defense.

We start by moving the grain
into the village,

so that they can't sh**t us from orbit
without risking its destruction.

Gather and account
for every hunting r*fle.

Every knife.

Every round of amm*nit*on in the village.

[uplifting music plays]

We'll need to dig defensive positions
to give us the element of surprise.

All right.

Astrid. Let's see what you got.

[Astrid] Mmm-hmm.

Wait.

Tuck your elbow.

Keep both eyes open.

[g*n powers up]

[Tarak] Okay. Today we're going to learn
the basics of attack and defense.

We have turned your harvesting tools
into weapons.

- So, what we're going to try and do is...
- [bolo blade slashes]

that.

Yeah.

[g*n powers up]

[Gunnar chuckles]

[Titus] Like a professional.

[grunts]

[Tarak] Great.

- Really good.
- [grunts]

We've got a natural.

[blunderbuss powers up]

[Kora] All right.

Hold on.

Oy! Prepare to transmit.

Right. Come on.

[ominous music plays]

[officer] Commander Cassius,

as we're coming around
the outer moons of the Mara system,

we're receiving an unscheduled
transmission from our Hawkshaws on Veldt.

[frequency tunes]

Transmitting.

[Cassius] What is so urgent
that it couldn't wait

till your normal report?

We're coming around Mara now.

We should be in low orbit
in less than a day.

Sir, the village has an asset.
We just discovered...

[Hawkshaw 1 screams]

What the f*ck are you doing?
We're on the same side.

- [Hawkshaw 2 grunts, yells]
- [bone cracks]

[screams]

[hologram glitches]

- It just went dead.

[switch clicks]

[dropship rumbles]

[dropship engine stops]

[system powers down]

[machinery beeps, powers down]

[suspenseful music builds]

[gasps, exhales]

Hello, James.

[Jimmy] You know, the last person
who called me that

was the old commander
of the Mechanicas Militarium

as he died in my arms.

Oh, I'm sorry.

It's all right. I like the way it sounds.

It makes me feel
something other than hopelessness.

You see...

I was given memories of a world
I will never see,

loyalty to a king I cannot serve

and love for a child I could not save.

But the sound of that name as you say it

lets me feel, even in the smallest way...

why I exist at all.

Is that why you saved Sam?

I'm not certain.

I know only that the thought of her
being hurt or destroyed

opened a part of me that had been closed.

[ethereal music plays]

You're choosing a side, James.

You and I are alike,
designed to k*ll for them.

Understand, their nightmare
is you and I fighting together.

Not because we are ordered or commanded,

but to defend something we love.

Let me show you something.

- How long?
- Yesterday.

This is the transmitter they were using.

I'm certain they were
in communication with the King's Gaze.

By now, they know everything.

You must know you cannot win.

Probably, right?

At least I'll die on the side of honor.

Is there still such a thing?

What do you feel, James?

[sighs]

How much do we think they know?

[Titus growls]

We would have to assume
they know everything.

Then it won't be enough
to fight defensively.

- We have to bring the fight to them.
- [Gunnar] Mm-hm.

How well do you know the Dreadnought?

What are you thinking?

[Aris] We've got
a ton of munitions for these.

And this. We found a rocket launcher.

Armor-piercing high-expl*sive detonators.

[expl*sive clicks]

- We've got some comms.
- [Kora] Good.

And the uniforms of the dead soldiers?

[Gunnar] Here.

The blood won't come out easy,
but we can try.

[Kora] No. We can use it. Leave it.

Do you have more?

[Gunnar] Sure.

[expl*sive clicks, beeps]

[breathes heavily]

[expl*sive trills, beeps]

[exhales nervously]

All set. [grunts]

[King's Gaze rumbles overhead]

[dramatic music plays]

Dreadnought.

Finish it! Finish up! Finish up! Come on!

Quick, quick, quick!

Finish your work! Find your positions!

Cover it up!

[villagers grunt]

[bell tolls]

[Cassius] These are the new formations.

It's the grain.

Look, they piled it against a building
so we can't destroy them.

And there and there, they've stacked it
as cover to sh**t from.

[Cassius] Clever.

[Noble] Hmm.

Certainly not the plans of a farmer.

It seems General Titus hasn't
drunk away his wits just yet.

Look here.

Thermal imaging shows clusters of people
in the Longhouse

at the top of the village.

No doubt they're women and children.

Hmm. Good. We'll do our best to forestall
a pitched battle in the village.

While I negotiate,
we'll dispatch the Krypteia.

Hmm. We'll capture the women and children.

Then we'll see
how motivated they are to fight.

[boarding ramp whirs, thuds]

[Noble] No village welcome, no?

Where's my warm embrace? [scoffs]

I was never given that cup of ale,
you know.

Arthelais.

Tell me what we're trying to achieve here.

The same thing as the last time we met.

I k*ll you.

Yes.

What an honor it was.

A scar. From the Scargiver herself.

[Kora] No blood
need be spilled here today.

I will offer you one chance
to avoid slaughter.

You do understand
what the Regent Balisarius will give me

when I bring you to your knees before him?

A seat in the Senate is what you seek,
I would imagine.

It's what I deserve.

If so, take the grain you need
to feed your men

on your voyage back to the Motherworld.

No more and no less.

You leave the villagers unharmed.

Report to Balisarius that the warriors
you sought evaded capture.

And I should take nothing, yes?

Nothing at all?

You take your lives.

This is your choice.

Disgrace and relegation,
or your head cleaved from your shoulders.

Your ship serving as your tomb.

Your families
and all of the Motherworld to know

that you were slaughtered
by the peasants of Veldt.

I've been tasked
with bringing honor to the Motherworld.

I intend to see
that task through to its end.

What amuses me most about all of this?

You think you have any power
with which to negotiate? You do not.

You think I don't know
you're hiding your women and children?

As you stand there talking to me,
your plan is already failing.

Well, unless of course a different
arrangement could be made, perhaps.

I could take the grain you offered.

I could do as you asked
and leave the villagers their lives.

There would be one cost
to this concession, however.

And that cost is you.

Of course every member of your band would
be greatly treasured by the Imperium,

but there is no denying
the one most sought after

by the Honorable Regent is you.

Arthelais herself.

[exclaims, inhales deeply]

So herein lies your choice.

Arthelais, surrender to me.

And I'll permit the villagers to live.

However, if you refuse,

those this village holds most dear,

the elderly, the children,

currently sheltered up in that Longhouse,

will be slaughtered by my men
on their way now.

Has enough blood not been spilt
in that beautiful building already?

Are you truly prepared to allow
this to continue in your name?

It's time, Arthelais.

What?

Kora.

Kora, what are you doing?

[Noble] I thought so.

Why don't you say goodbye to your friend?

Your father awaits you.

[Gunnar] Kora, look at me.

Huh?

- [Kora sniffles]
- What's happening, huh?

[Kora, softly] I'm sorry.

I won't allow this place to die for me.

I know what I'm doing.

He's lying to you.

- Just let me go. Just let me go!
- [Gunnar] No!

[tense music plays]

[guardian g*n powers up]

No. No.

No!

[bell tolls]

- [grunts]
- [uraki bellows]

Come on.

Why did you stop me?

He'd have said anything
to have you surrender without a fight,

but his words are worthless.

We won't let you
sacrifice yourself to a lie.

Now, come on!

[both grunt]

Let's go.

There's a wound.

There is a situation in the engine room.

He said a woman has infiltrated the ship.

[Noble] Arthelais.

Arthelais is aboard this ship.

That is impossible.

[Noble] No, it's her.

She's come to us.

It's perfect.

Alert all sectors.
I want her captured at once.

And Cassius?

You may fire on the village.

Sir, the grain.

There's no need for the grain now.

The Scargiver has come to us.

Plus, I'd rather our men starve

than risk exposing ourselves
to more of Titus' dirty tricks.

But we have men on the ground.

Yes. A few less mouths to feed.

Now hold the second wave
and fire on that f*cking village.

You heard me.

Destroy it.

You heard the Admiral. Charge the cannons.

Main g*n.

Charge the cannons.

You will be weapons free once we notify
the second wave to stand down.

Yes, sir.

The second wave

The Admiral has decided
to vaporize the village

with our big g*ns here on the King's Gaze.

[general 2] Guess the rumors of
taking the fugitives alive were just that.

Move out!

Go, go, go, go, go!

Are you hit? Are you okay? Come on.

Wait. Okay.

Hey. Stay with me.

Stay with me. Stay with me. Stay with me.

[tearfully]
Why can't I have this one thing?

[sobs]

- Stay with me. Please.
- No. It's okay.

Look at what you've done.

You saved us.

All of us.

Hey.

[Kora sobs]

I love you.

Please.

Please.

I know what you are.

And I love you.

Please.

[squadron passes overhead]

[dramatic music plays]

Look!

Form up on me!

Yes, Commander. On you.

Target those dropships!

Yes, Commander. On you.

[Devra] Black Mountain Squadron,
take those fighters.

[Kora] Look, it's Devra Bloodaxe,
and the entire rebel fleet.

It's really over. It's...

No. [sobs]

No.

[wails]

[mournful music plays]

I love you.

I love you.

[sobs]

[Hagen] From other worlds
they came to fight for us.

[mournful music continues]

To die for us.

May they find their peace.

We honor them now in the only way we can.

By remembering their names...

when next we bring in the harvest.

A season from now, a hundred seasons.

And by carrying on.

By carrying on.

[mournful music continues]

All of you, honor the fallen.

You honor my brother and his bravery.

Do not speak of me
when you speak of honor and bravery.

I've lied to you.

To all of you.

Titus.

I know, child.

I know.

You know that I'm Arthelais?

Adopted daughter of the Regent Balisarius?

And the assassin of the Princess Issa?

I know your name. Yes.

But you were not her assassin...

for the princess is still alive.

You thought she could be k*lled so easily?

No. She's more than death.

What am I to do?

You have a reason now, do you not?

To find her and to fight?

If you do choose to fight,

I will stand with you.

All of us.

And I as well.

[uplifting music plays]

[Kora cries]

[Jimmy] If I could be of use...

I, too, have this.

You wish to fight with us, robot?
Help find this lost princess?

If what you say is true,
and the princess lives,

I have no choice.

I serve the line of the slain King.
It is my honor to fight.

To find her and to fight.

[uplifting music continues]

To find her and to fight.

[sinister music plays]

[guard] Sire, we've discovered...

[Balisarius] Shh! One moment.

I do love this part.

Come, you can tell me as we walk.

You've brought word
from Admiral Noble, I assume.

When can we expect his return?

Yes. Well, we felt you should know
as soon as we could confirm that

we have no contact with the Admiral
and fear the King's Gaze is lost.

Lost?

Destroyed, sire.

We were able to confirm that the ship
disintegrated upon impact with Veldt.

As far as we can surmise,
there may be no survivors.

Survivors?

No.

No, there will be no survivors.

She would have seen to that.

She, sire?
