[FILM REEL TICKING]

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

Whispered something

in your ear

It was a perverted

thing to say

But I said it anyway

Made you smile

and look away

Nothing's gonna

hurt you baby

As long as you're with me

you'll be just fine

Nothing's gonna

hurt you baby

Nothing's gonna take you

from my side

Nothing's gonna

hurt you baby

Nothing's gonna take you

from my side

Listen, I have been fixing

this stereo

since before you were born.

Okay. Move. Move.

Let me get back there before you

blow someone's eardrums.

These guys are coming.

On my way.

Oh, sh*t!

Mommy, you didn't change

the calendar yet?

Oh! Well, I was waiting for you

to help me. Ready?

- Mm-hmm.

- One, two, big jump!

Oh-ho-ho.

Go for it.

Perfect.

Your, ah, your ideas definitely

gave us a head-start but

you know,

it feels good to be..

kind of doing our own thing.

See anything?

No. Just proof you guys haven't

dusted in about ten years.

Mom says you have to

set the table.

Yeah, after this level.

Your sister will play for you.

Or do you want me to?

I'm coming!

Hey, Dag.

- You know how to play?

- Nope.

Ah!

Dinner bell!

- That should do it.

- What you don't want to..

You don't want to test it first?

No. We're good.

I suppose you're gonna

wanna gloat now.

No, I don't do this

for the recognition.

It's enough for me

that you know.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

I can hold my breath under water

for 30 seconds.

- No way.

- Are you kidding me?

But her goal

is an entire minute.

Then you can perform

underwater heists.

A minute,

which her teacher thinks

she's gonna be able to do

by this spring.

Are you guys staying over

till tomorrow, Ethan?

Oh, I wish. We actually

have to head out in a little bit

and get the lab ready

for tonight.

Uh, what's tonight.

Well, with the kind of

energy draw

that we need for the project,

the only safe place

that we can really do it

is at the A.I. lab

which is conveniently

empty tonight.

What about my swim lesson?

Can we have a moment?

- Ethan?

- Yeah, yeah, I'm coming.

Listen, I get why you're upset

but please try to understand

where I'm coming from here.

We were just looking forward

to having you home.

Okay. But I'm only an hour away.

It's not like I'm...

We haven't seen you in months.

Months.

Okay. Well, I can..

I'll try to be better

about that. It's just..

I mean, you know

how I get when I...

What about your Aunt Susan?

Who's gonna pick her up

tomorrow?

Ah, I don't know.

You guys gotta figure something

else out, I guess.

You need to get

your priorities straight.

That's exactly

what I'm doing, Dad.

Trust me, classes are over

on the 12th.

And then you guys have me

for the rest of spring break.

But tonight,

you've gotta let me go.

I mean, this is the first chance

we've really had

to test this thing out.

- Please.

- Okay.

Okay.

Yeah. I guess

you better go then.

Thank you for understanding.

Uh, I think

we're gonna head out.

- Don't go yet.

- Mom, thank you for dinner.

- You're welcome.

- Yeah, don't go, Ethan.

See you guys soon, okay?

- I'm sorry.

- You're welcome. It's okay.

We'll see you soon.

Oh, I'm so sorry.

No, it's my fault, too.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

[MUSIC CONTINUES]

Hey.

Let's do this.

Hey, tonight's the night,

huh, Lightman?

Keep walking.

Break a leg, b*tches.

- Where's the shunt motor?

- The other case.

Careful. Careful.

We call it ELI. Short for

Electromagnetic Induction.

Imagine a world where

your phone never dies

or appliances

come without plugs.

You know,

we have wireless internet

so, why not

wireless electricity.

Our method should have

wireless electricity

in every home within

a decade.

I mean, the same basic

principle we've built upon

has been around

for quite some time

but it's never been

successfully implemented

until tonight.

[BEEPING]

Here we go.

Signal's looking good.

Starting at 100 RPM.

Come on.

Should something be happening?

Just give it a second.

Come on.

Are you sure the bulb works?

Yes, I'm sure.

Give it a minute.

The signal's all over

the place.

Alright.

Do it..

Now!

- These readings are all wrong.

- What is going on?

Boosting the signal.

Come on. Come on.

Wait.

Do you hear that?

Come on.

Ethan, be careful.

Ethan!

Oh, sh*t!

Ethan, we've gotta go.

Sh*t! Sh*t!

[ALARM BLARING]

Blackout is campus-wide.

Please respond to building B.

[ALARM BLARING]

I hope we don't

get in trouble.

- What happened?

- I've no idea.

Okay.

Time to go.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

- You see anything?

- I think we're clear.

[MURMURING]

[INDISTINCT CHATTERING]

- Hey.

- Hey.

Can't take a break?

Well, um, not right now.

I have to figure this out.

Stop obsessing.

I'm not obsessed.

What are you doing?

Mean.

Well, figure it out later.

I want to figure it out now.

Let's do something fun.

Okay.

Let's make a tent.

- A tent?

- Yeah.

Alright.

[CHUCKLING]

[CELL PHONE RINGING]

What? One second.

Oh, weird.

- Hello?

- Ethan.

You gotta come home.

There was an accident.

- Yeah. Hold on.

- A truck..

I don't know, a truck crashed

right in front of Mom and Dad.

What.. What..

W... what do you mean?

Matt!

Okay!

Matt, come on.

I mean it!

I need caffeine.

Let's go!

Come on!

The bus is leaving.

Here we go.

I'm in gear.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

And, ah, if you have any

problems with it

just let me know.

- All good?

- Yeah.

Just a quarter-inch splitter.

- This came in for you today.

- Oh, thanks.

Oh, thanks.

[HONKING HORN]

- See ya!

- Bye, Matt!

See ya!

- Hey.

- What's this?

Nothin'.

Just a part for work.

- School good?

- Yup.

And will he help you

with your homework tonight?

Okay, make sure

you ask him, okay?

- Okay. Bye, Ms. Nash.

- Okay.

Okay. Bye, Becca.

I'll see you tomorrow.

Hey. Ready to go?

- Yeah.

- Alright.

Ah, can I talk to you

for a minute, Mr. Lightman...

- Ethan's fine.

- Okay.

I just wanted to talk to you

about Becca.

Uh, yeah.

What about Becca?

It's just that lately

she seems to be

having some trouble interacting

with the other children.

Look, I just want to help.

Oh, we don't need it.

But thank you.

Ethan!

Hey, Tom.

How're you doing?

I'm alright.

How've you been?

I haven't

seen you around much.

Yeah. They're keepin' me pretty

busy at the power plant.

Yeah.

You guys holdin' up okay?

Uh, yeah. You know, it's..

It's been a..

- It's been rough, but..

- Yeah.

I think we're hanging in there.

But, uh, I should probably

get back to them.

Sure, alright.

Hey.. Hey, listen.

When Karen died a while back,

everybody always said

"You'll get over it."

That's, that's the lie

that people will tell you.

But, uh, it gets better.

I promise.

Anyway, you guys need anything,

you, uh, just let me know, okay?

Yeah, we will.

- Alright, well, um..

- Yeah.

- Okay.

- Alright.

- I'll see you later.- Uh-huh.

Why was Ms. Nash sad?

What do you mean?

When you talked to her,

she looked sad.

That's 'cause I wasn't

very nice to her.

You should be nice.

I like her.

[SIGHING]

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

[SIGHING]

[DOOR SHUTS]

Matt!

Okay.

- Have a good day.

- You got it?

Don't forget your bag.

- Bye.

- See ya.

Okay.

Don't forget, um,

you've got to..

You've got to go to

your sister's swim practice.

I'm going to pick you both up

there later today, alright?

- Please don't forget.

- Okay.

Please don't touch

my leg next time.

Just say "Okay".

- Okay?

- Okay.

[BEEPING]

Come on.

- Ah, what's...

- This happened before.

I got it.

- There..

- Perfect. Alright.

Uh, you're all set.

- Thank you, sir.

- Yeah.

- Is everything okay, Ethan?

- Yeah. Sorry, just, um..

Why don't you head home?

Get some down time.

No, I'm fine really. I..

I need the hours,

so I'll stick around.

Are you serious?

It's not even noon yet.

Tuesdays are dead anyway.

Alright.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

[EXHALES]

Ugh..

[SIGHING]

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

[MUSIC CONTINUES]

Hey, Matt.

Milady.

How was school?

Good.

Ready?

Set.

[WHISTLING]

Come on, come on, come on..

Yes.

[CAWING]

[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

[DRAMATIC MUSIC]

[MUSIC CONTINUES]

Just come on,

come on, come on..

[WHIRRING]

[ELECTRICITY CRACKLING]

No!

Agh!

Okay.

[CELL PHONE VIBRATING]

Oh, sh*t! Oh, sh*t!

Guys, I am so, so sorry.

- How was swim practice?

- Good.

You know, I thought

we'd maybe switch it up tonight.

Maybe make something

for dinner, huh?

How's that sound?

- Can I help?

- Sure you can. Yeah.

[BIRDS CHATTERING]

[CHIMES RINGING]

That's not how Mom does it.

Okay. Well, then,

what's next?

Too much.

Hey, Matt, can you grab some

sodas from the garage, please?

I want a Doctor Pepper.

Did you hear that?

Then I looked back, and she was

still half the pool away.

What?

That's amazing.

My coach says

I might be part mermaid.

You never know. You could start

growing a tail or something.

Matt, I already apologized,

I don't know what else

you want me to say.

How about apologizing

for why you were late?

Becca, why don't you

give us a second?

You can finish your dinner

in front of the TV if you want.

Okay.

How can you go back to working

on that thing?

This is important to me, Matt.

I'm not just doing this

for me, Matt, okay?

Everyone's gonna want this

technology, okay.

This could really

change things for us.

It did change things. Okay?

- Mom and Dad are dead.

- It was an accident.

They wouldn't have been driving

if you didn't leave

to work on that machine.

Are you saying you,

you preferred

if I died, is that it?

No! You wouldn't have!

Okay, they died

because the truck

crashed right in front

of them.

If... if they'd left earlier,

or later, they'd have been fine.

- You can't know that, Matt!

- Yes, I can!

There's no possible way

you could have left

the exact same time

gone the exact same way,

and... and at the exact speed.

It's impossible. If you'd

stayed, we'd all be here.

- You don't know that.

- Yes, I do.

Alright, bath time, Bec.

Just wash up and then bed.

I'll meet you in your room to

tell you a story or something.

You mean your room.

Well, you can't sleep

on my floor forever, you know.

Tonight, I can though, right?

Yeah.

Okay, tonight you can.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

[MUSIC CONTINUES]

[WHIRRING]

[CLOCK TICKING]

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

Aw, jeez.

Hey, Marie.

I saw your light

and I thought

you and the kids might want

a little home cooking.

[CREAKING]

[CLOCK TICKING]

[CREAKING]

- Anytime.

- Ethan!

Okay. That's my cue.

Um, I gotta go.

- Goodnight.

- Thank you for this.

Goodnight.

What happened?

You okay?

Quit spying on me, Matt!

Are you spying on her?

Oh yeah, I was spying on her.

- I saw you, Matt!

- Okay.

Come out of there.

Let's go get ready for bed.

[CRICKETS CHIRPING]

"But still, others say

the queen kept it"

"to remind herself

of her son's wisdom."

"Still, he couldn't find

a real princess."

Come on.

Please.

Stupid!

Goddammit!

[GLASS SHATTERING]

Matt, I'm supposed to be the one

to change the calendar.

Don't look at me.

Well, somebody changed it.

Good morning.

Morning.

Excuse me.

Look, there's Tom.

Oh.

Hey.

More parts for your project?

I wanna see your project.

Yeah?

Okay.

So... imagine walking

in the house

and right away the phone

in your... in your pocket

starts charging.

Or, or powering a light bulb

without a socket.

That's what this machine does

or will be able to do.

It's wireless electricity.

- That's so cool.

- Yeah.

I know.

But how does it work?

Well, we gotta turn it on first.

Do you wanna do it?

Okay.

So just press those two buttons

at the same time.

- These two?

- Yeah. Just like that.

Good. Now this one.

Good. Now, there's one more.

Let me do this.

Um... press that yellow one

for me.

- This one?

- Um-hmm.

Okay, last bit.

Here we go.

Does it work?

Well, yeah.

It's not... it's gonna work.

Very, very soon.

Very, very soon.

[CELL PHONE RINGING]

I'm calling back later.

Alright. Well, I think

it's time for bed.

You can help me with this

tomorrow, though. I promise.

- Okay.

- Lots of work to be done.

Okay.

Hey, it's me again.

Um, I hope you're also

doing okay.

If there's anything you need,

please let me know.

I'm here for you, and you don't

have to go through this alone.

I'm here whenever you're ready.

[DRAMATIC MUSIC]

That was the play at my school

last year.

This year it's same.

You have to be

in grade four to do it.

Hi, Matt.

Hey... hey, Bec.

Who were you talking to?

Just Mom.

I'm telling her

about the school.

You were talking to Mom?

Maybe.

What do you mean?

Did you see something?

No. Just... playin' around.

Okay. Cool.

Don't... don't stay up

too late, okay?

I won't.

I'll tell you more later.

I love you too.

But when can I tell them?

Ethan!

- Hmm? Oh.

- It's like 7:
30!

What?

Oh. Did you eat anything yet?

No, I... I..

Okay, well,

there's not really time now.

Can you just, uh,

just go get dressed?

Is... is... is Becca awake?

I don't know. Can you just

check on her, please?

- Did you change this?

- Um-umm.

- Alright. Go, go, go, go.

- Bye.

Sorry

- Hi, Ms. Nash.

- Hi.

Good thing Ms. Nash loves me.

Are you alright?

You look kinda pale,

like you might be getting sick?

[SIGHING]

Okay.

Last night, I was

in Mom and Dad's room..

...and..

...I felt something weird.

And then I saw something.

Well, what?

What did... what'd you see?

I think I saw Mom and Dad.

And it... it wasn't just my

imagination or whatever, okay?

I know..

Weird things have

been happening in the house.

Like, last night,

I... I swear to God

there was somebody in my room.

And the date on Mom's calendar

keeps changing by itself.

How do you explain that?

Alright, Matt, Matt,

just stop it, okay?

[SCHOOL BELL RINGING]

You can't live in that house

and tell me you don't feel them.Mom and Dad are still here.

I... I think the minute

you turned on that machine..

Have you ever thought

it might be giving out

some sort of signal?

Yeah! I know it's..

I know it's giving out

a signal, alright?

I'm glad you didn't say any

of this in front of your sister.

You would have scared

the sh*t out of her.

Becca told me she was talking

to Mom last night..

...right after I saw them!

I think Mom and Dad

are trying to tell us something.

Don't you think

you should listen this time?

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

Just got to school, Matt.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

[SIGHING]

[MUSIC CONTINUES]

Weird.

Becca, did you move

Dad's toolbox?

No!

- See you later, Lightman.

- Oh, yeah. Peace.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

I wanna sleep in

my room tonight.

Okay.

So, what brought this on?

I'm not scared anymore.

They watch me while I sleep.

[DRAMATIC MUSIC]

Hey.

- What did you say to her?

- What?

Why'd you put that stuff

into her head about Mom and Dad?

What are you talking about?

She brought that up to me.

Matt, don't lie

to me, alright!

If you didn't say anything,

why is she

suddenly sleeping

in her own room?

Isn't that a good thing?

That she's deluded?

No, Matt, it's not!

Ethan, she's not deluded!

Jesus, when are you

gonna wake up and realize..

Mom and Dad don't like it

when you fight.

Ethan, don't be so hard

on your brother.

Sorry, Bec. Yeah, we'll try

to be more quiet, okay?

Just go back to bed.

[INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER]

...are amazing.

What would you expect to pay

for this fine piece

of exercise equipment?

Coming up after the break,

we got "Six In A Row."

[INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER]

Those who believe

in the holy spirit

shall find the path

of righteousness.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

It's Mom and Dad.

Let me down

let me down

Now do you believe us?

Let me down

[LAUGHING]

It's Mom and Dad.

Oh.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

[MUSIC CONTINUES]

[MUSIC CONTINUES]

[MUSIC CONTINUES]

Oh!

What happened?

Nothing.

Just dropped something.

It's really good to see you.

Sorry I haven't called.

It's just been nuts.

You know, I drive a mini-van now

and go to PTA meetings.

It's pretty ridiculous.

But, uh, I actually

I wanted to talk to you

about our machine..

...about ELI.

What about it?

Well, I figured since we

practically made it together

you're the only other person

that knows

the technology as well as I do.

You know, our focus was always

on trying to get enough power.

But I think we took for granted

that the signal actually worked.

Well, if you don't

have a signal

you don't have anything.

We... well,

I think it does work.

Just not on light bulbs.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

Like, when you feel a presence

or... or when someone says

they see a spirit

and they have

a physical reaction to it

like the hairs on their arm

pricking up

or on the back of their neck.

What if there is a scientific

explanation for that?

Like, a shift in the

electromagnetic energy levels?

Matt, Ethan told us not to turn

it on without his permission.

Well, Ethan's not here.

I'm in charge.

That's not how you do it.

[WHIRRING]

You know our consciousness

has a frequency

so, where does all

that energy go when we die?

I know this sounds crazy.

But, Hannah, there's...

there's stuff

going on in my house, okay?

Stuff that I cannot explain.

It all started

when I turned on the machine.

[WHIRRING]

Ethan, listen to me.

You have to talk

to someone about this.

Look, I came here to have

a serious discussion with you

not to be psychoanalyzed.

A serious discussion

about what, ghosts?

Yeah, this was a mistake.

I gotta get back anyway.

- Ethan.

- Bye, Hannah.

[DOG BARKING]

[BECCA AND MATT SCREAMING]

- In here! In here!

- Ethan, watch!

Go again. Go again.

[LAUGHING]

It's so cool!

This is awesome!

Do you see this?

Isn't this amazing?

I know that was

a lot of fun today

but... you guys

have to promise me

you're not gonna

turn on the machine

when I'm not here, alright?

Okay, I promise.

Alright. Goodnight.

- Ethan?

- Yeah?

I really want to see them.

Mom says the signal

needs to be stronger.

- Hey.

- Hey.

For now, we keep this

top secret.

We can't tell anybody

what we're up to, not even Dag.

Okay?

Yeah.

And I'll talk to Becca too.

I don't know how

this is gonna affect her

but... I've opened

some kind of door

whether I like it or not.

But if there's a chance

we can talk to Mom and Dad

we gotta try.

There's still a long way to go.

I can't really seem

to strengthen the signal.

Every time I try cranking up

the power, I trip the breaker.

Sh*t.

So, what are you gonna do?

[CAR APPROACHING]

[INTENSE MUSIC]

[DOOR CLOSES]

Welcome to my workshop.

I was half expecting

to find a DeLorean in here.

- I wish.

- How much is it pullin'?

Uh, a lot. A lot.

I just, I can't seem

to get enough juice

without blowing the breaker.

And I thought maybe

you'd have some..

...secret tricks

that you could show me.

[CHUCKLES]

Well, there's lots of ways

of nabbin' power

from your neighbor's houses

but, uh, it's pretty complicated

super illegal.

Right.

We could probably rig

somethin' up temporary.

- Yeah?

- Let's hit the basement.

[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

Hey, Bec.

Were you talking

to Mom and Dad again?

Yeah, I was just telling them

about my new friend..

...Alice.

They don't think

I should talk to her.

Really?

So, do Mom and Dad

actually talk to you?

Like, full conversations?

Kind of.

W... why don't,

why don't they talk to me?

You're not ready yet.

What does that mean?

- That's what Mom says.

- And Dad?

What does Dad say?

I don't know.

He just wants us to make

the machine work better.

[GRUNTS]

- That should do it.

- Alright.

You'll have access to most

of your house's power with this.

You're gonna wanna

re... replace it

with something more

permanent eventually

but should be fine

for now.

No. This is, this is perfect.

I knew you'd have something

up your sleeve.

Just remember, you wanna ramp

this thing up

you turn most of the things

off in your house.

Even a little bit

of an overdraw

it's enough to trip

the whole system.

You're gonna wanna make

a few adjustments

inside there too.

Make sure it can handle

the power, huh?

Yeah, I've definitely

got my work cut out for me

that's for sure.

Maybe some day you'll tell me

if this time machine of yours

actually works, huh?

[CHUCKLES] Well, I'll need a

few more gigawatts for that

but I'll let you know.

Well, I'll, uh, see you around.

I'll walk you out of here.

[INTENSE MUSIC]

[DOOR CREAKS]

[YAWNING]

Okay.

What do you think?

Modified the design,

made it a little bit simpler.

Bec, look!

What do you think?

Huh?

Does that mean

it'll work better?

Yeah, I hope so.

- That's the idea.

- Can we switch it back on now?

No, not yet.

Very soon, though.

[CELL PHONE DINGS]

I need extra help on cash.

Ah, here we go.

That's what we need.

One, two, three, four.

That's probably good, right?

- Mm-hmm.- Yes.

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

- Yo, yo!

- Hey.

[DOOR CLOSES]

What happened in here?

You forget to pay the bills?

Uh, new house rule.

Use as little power as possible.

[SCATTING]

Okay.

I'm not supposed to tell you

but..

...I think my Mom and Dad

might be back.

Yeah, right.

I'm serious.

- A... are they here right now?

- Yeah.

Where? Show me.

Well, the machine's not on.

- I think he's working on it.

- Convenient.

[DAG SCOFFS]

I'm telling the truth, Dag.

I swear to God.

- Mrs. Lightman?

- Shut... shut up!

[LAUGHS]

Come on. I'll show you

how to beat that level.

Becca!

Becca!

Show time!

I'm in the bath!

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

Where's Lulu?

I gave her to Alice.

Oh.

I don't think

I've met Alice yet, have I?

She's shy.

I'm her only friend.

Oh, okay.

Um... alright.

Well, goodnight.

Ethan?

Hmm?

Does the machine work?

Not yet.

But it will. I promise.

Oh, hello.

Dude, check this out.

- You know your hot neighbor?

- Yeah.

Yeah, she's changing

in her bedroom

and curtains are wide open.

What?

Where?

She... she was, she was

right there. Um..

- You idiot!

- What?

Dude... dude, I swear.

- Come on. She was..

- Yeah.

What? You were getting turned on

by a hat rack?

Dude, it was

a woman's rack, okay?

Yeah, right.

Whatever. I'm gonna go

take a leak.

Yeah, make sure

that's all you do.

Ha, ha. Very funny, a**hole.

Jesus! Tom! Tom.

Hey.

I need to know.

What's that machine of yours

really do?

Well, um..

...the technical term

is electromagnetic induction...

Ethan!

Do not lie to me.

[INTENSE MUSIC]

Your machine..

...has a radius beyond

this house.

I thought it was

some mental thing.

Leftover guilt from,

from having moved on.

What have you seen?

My wife.

[CROW CAWING]

[EXHALES]

She killed herself..

...right here in this house.

Truth is..

...I've always felt

like she was still here..

...watching me.

Turns out I was right.

She never left me.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

[MUSIC CONTINUES]

- Alright. Have a good one.

- Bye.

See ya.

Hey, Ethan, do you have a sec?

Oh, yeah.

She's doing a lot better

since we last spoke.

Good. Yeah, she told me

she made a new friend.

Someone named Alice.

Oh. Yeah, she's mentioned Alice

to me too.

I, I assumed

she was a relative.

Why's that?

Well, Becca said

that she lives with you.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

Hey, Jacob, uh..

...do you believe in ghosts?

I... do... not.

Hey, Bec, can you tell me

a little bit more about Alice?

Well, she's really nice.

She used to live where we live.

- You mean at our house?

- Yep.

Did she start visiting after

Ethan turned on the machine?

I think so.

She's always hiding on me,

though.

Why?

'Cause she's afraid of Henry.

That's why I gave her Lulu..

...to protect her.

Who's Henry?

I don't know.

I haven't met him yet.

[INTENSE MUSIC]

Hannah!

Hey, Bec!

Come here.

I missed you.

- Hey, what's up?

- I missed you.

Hey, Matt.

Can you please take that inside,

and Becca?

- Come on, Bec.

- I'll be in there in a second.

You're staying for dinner,

right?

It's up to you.

- Yeah.

- Yes!

Um, I need

to show you something.

I had Adnan send me the video.

After watching it a few times,

I noticed something.

Okay, that'd be my shadow.

Yours, and what's that?

[EERIE MUSIC]

So, it's always done this,

since day one.

More power seems to intensify

the signal.

Oh, God. Hannah, I think the

signal's reaching beyond the house.

And since I've realized that,

I... I've been too afraid

to turn it back on.

I mean, Tom saw his dead wife.

It's one thing

bringing my parents back

but I'm pretty sure

everyone else

would rather

their loved ones stay dead.

But what makes you so sure

you're interacting

with your parents?

I mean, what if the machine

isn't bringing

people back exactly

just amplifying the energy

that's already there?

We're not just encountering an echo,

if that's what you're saying.

I mean, Becca's had entire

conversations with my parents.

- And Alice.

- Alice?

You just gave me an idea.

Who's Alice?

Let's find out.

[INTENSE MUSIC]

Uh... hm.

Your parents bought

the house

from a family..

Oh. It's..

The Szerbiaks.

And they moved to Michigan,

I think.

And before the Szerbiaks

it was..

Hm.

It was Diane and Frank Evans?

Frank worked

at my father's practice.

Do you remember anyone

ever living there named Alice?

Where did you hear that name?

I haven't looked at these

in so long.

That's me, Jo-Jo Gold

and Alice.

Alice lived at your house

with Mr. and Mrs. Gifford.

She was their foster child.

[SIGHS]

One day..

...she disappeared.

The police looked for her.

We all did.

But she was never found.

There was never any evidence

to prove anything

but the police

were convinced

that Mr. Gifford

had done something to Alice.

This.

And I'm guessing that this

belongs to you, little lady.

- Thanks.

Alright, boys.

- Alright. Sounds good.

Heaven is closer now today

Um..

So, I just wanted to say

thank you.

[CHUCKLES]

Any time.

They echo what I fear

Twisting the bones

until they snap

- I'll see you at 8:00.

- Bye.

I scream but no one knows

You say I'm familiar

cold to touch

And then you turn and go

Feels like heaven

Feels like heaven

See how we planned

for saddened eyes

Oh! Ethan, wait, wait,

wait, wait. Wait.

And tears to pave the way

Oh, I couldn't believe

you'd go.

Bye. Bye, bye.

I'm gonna miss you so much.

Bye, Matt.

Becca, sweetheart.

- You be safe now.

- Okay. I will.

- Okay.

- Alright. Take care.

Bye.

Too close for comfort now

We can recall the harmony

That lingered

but turned sour

Alright.

Feels like heaven

This place is going to be

amazing for you guys.

Yeah, and only ten minutes

from school.

Feels like heaven

- Ethan, guess what.

- What?

Matt says there's a pool

two blocks away.

- Did he really tell you that?

- Um-hm.

After I told him

that was gonna be a surprise?

Are you serious?

Dude, come on.

But, yes,

I'm also a psychopath.

Have you guys checked

for secret rooms yet?

Matt..

Matt, no.

Too soon.

Dr. Phil says humor is

a healthy method for recovery.

- Is that show still on?

- Who's Dr. Phil?

Dr. Phil is...

She doesn't even know

who that is.

Can you get the door?
