LISA [ON VOICE MAIL]: Meg. Hey, it's Lisa.
I just talked to Dr. Lewis
and you're good to go,
so maybe you can
come in this afternoon.
Okay, bye.
Hey.
You look nervous.
Are you okay?
It's a job interview. I think
I'm supposed to be nervous.
Okay. Come on,
let's go get a coffee.
LISA:
This will be good.
We'll go to meetings in
the morning after our shifts end
and I'll be three floors up,
so if you need anything...
You know?
Thank you for this.
Don't thank me yet. You still
have to meet Dr. Lewis.
DR. LEWIS:
This job is not for everyone.
We've had three overnight
intake assistants
in the last
six months alone.
Because of the hours?
No, because it's a thankless,
solitary position.
The smell. You never get used
to the smell.
I was a cop. I'm totally
used to bad smells.
Lisa mentioned
that there were issues.
Yes. There were issues.
But I'm much better now.
- [BEEPS]
- [LOCK CLICKS]
Well, she assured me
that you could handle the job.
Is it something you think
you can handle?
I can handle it.

being here.

imaginations are running wild,
they're hearing things
go bump in the night.
Not me.
I believe when you die,
you die.
End of story.
Good.
COMPUTER:
Arrived at morgue.
At night,
you can't get in or out
without swiping
this card.
If you lose it, hospital
security has to let you in.
They will not be happy.
Most of the lights
are on a sensor.
The rest you have
to switch on manually.
There are a lot
of files that
need to be entered
into the system.
I hope you
don't mind data entry.
No, not at all.
Men's room is down there,
women's room is down there,
and down there to the left
is the incinerator room
for cremation.
COMPUTER:

DR. LEWIS: This intake
bay is for drop-offs only.
No drop-off, no access.
And you never leave the premises
while you're on duty.
No exceptions.
- [CHIMES]
- COMPUTER: Arrived at morgue.
Well, you bring the cadaver up
from the intake bay,
and take it into the receiving

the body and then close-ups
of each individual injury.

Rigor mortis makes a corpse
difficult to fingerprint.

Oh, I, uh...
I started a new job
last night. A night job.
That's great.
Doing what?
Overnight intake assistant
at the morgue.
It's better
than it sounds.
Yeah, I'm basically running the
place at night, all on my own.
Are you sure that's
a good idea, you know...
spending so much time alone
right now?
Actually, I do.
You know,
it keeps me from
going out at night
doing things I might regret
in the morning.
It worked for Lisa
and she thinks
it could work
for me, too.
- "Lisa"?
- My AA sponsor.
The nurse at the hospital.
She says it keeps her
out of trouble
working the night shift.
So, when a job opened up at
the morgue, she thought of me.
Yeah, still, too much time alone
is never good for anyone.
Says the guy who moved out.
You didn't give me
much of a choice.
That's not true, Andrew.

He is holing up with
his psycho ex-girlfriend.
[GRUNTS]
It seems like he should
be making some new friends.
Yeah, I think
he should probably pick
a better psycho

they found chloroform

It could have
been her pimp.
It might have been
a drug dealer.

Dr. Lewis

I was smart enough

can't breathe.
Are you hungry?
I can get us some take-out

You know, when that guy
attacked me tonight...
my first instinct
wasn't to run.
You know,
I wanted to defend myself,
to stop him.
I didn't freeze.
Why couldn't
I have done that
when there was a gun
pointed at my partner?
And then none of this
would have happened.

No, he's not talking.
We'll know more once

That's the plan.
I just know how you get

Okay, look, I appreciate
you coming here,
but I've got things covered.
Okay?
Is there something else?
I know this
isn't the right time...
but when I picked up my stuff,
there was something missing.
A bottle of Xanax.
And you're assuming
that I...
what, stole them from you?
- Did you?
- [SCOFFS]
It's a valid question.
You're not supposed
to be around

You misplace a bottle of pills

Why are you getting

I'm not getting defensive.
I'm getting pissed.
You know, it's as if
you're completely incapable
of giving me

I'm just a call away. Okay?

When I went to check

I mean,
I could have sworn it was her.
Meg, who is "her"?
What are you talking about?
I need to show you
something.
There.
What is that?
I don't know.
Well, I mean,
it looks like a shadow.
It's not a shadow.
Look,
when that guy broke in...
he kept talking
about the woman he killed...
Hannah Grace,
how she wasn't really dead.
I looked her up.
She died three months ago
during an exorcism.
You know I don't believe
in that kind of stuff, but...
...this, to me,
is not a shadow.
What is this?
Lisa, I didn't take any.
- Are you lying to me?
- No, okay?
You need to believe me
on this one.
I promise you,
I didn't take any.
I wanted to, but I didn't.
I've just had them in my bag
for comfort. I promise.
Meg, do you...?
Do you remember
when we were in meetings
and they started talking
about coping mechanisms?
Yeah.
An addict's brain
tries to find
new ways
to cope with stress.
Everything that has happened
to you today,
the stress
that it has caused,
your brain is desperate
to find a way to cope with it.
And it is going to do
anything it can
to convince you to use again.
My brain did not put a corpse
on the security footage.
Look, I don't know
what that thing is,
but what I do know
is you're jumping
to the least plausible
explanation.
And right now
you've got to focus.
So, don't see things
that aren't there.
- Here.
- No.
- Just take them.

Okay. Well, try me.
MEGAN: So, it's obviously
been a long night...
and I'm probably

She had a huge wound...
going down this side
of her abdomen
when you dropped her off.
Correct?
Yeah, I could have sworn
that she did.
So, where is it now?
And her arm was banged up
too, right?
Yeah. Have you checked
the admittance photos?
The camera broke down and when
I tried to scan her prints,
the scanner died too.
That's weird.
So, I had a friend
run her prints
at the police station.
And?
Hannah Grace,
she died three months ago

I'm sorry.
It's not my business.
I...
[SIGHS] I had a rough patch

I don't know, I guess
I thought I saw that in you.
I'm sure that there is

for all of this.
You just... Megan,
you've got to be careful
that you don't
drive yourself crazy here.
I know.
He's adorable.
I used to have
a drinking problem.
And I would get drunk...
and lie and cheat and...
people told me
that I was a dick sometimes.
All the time.
And then...
this guy shows up...
and he made me want
to be a better person.
So...
I quit drinking...
I quit lying...
and then I was finally
able to be honest

to be honest with myself.
If you ever want to talk,
I'm the guy.

our Lord, be gone!
You have to understand...
[SNIFFLES]
...I did what I did...
...to save the lives
of others.
But the demon
was too powerful.
It stayed.
The next day,
when we went to bury her...
...her body, it disappeared
from the mortuary.
[CRACKING]
Four people were dead.
We have to get her
to the incinerator.
The knife wasn't enough.
The only way to destroy
this thing is to burn her.
Anything else
just slows her down.
