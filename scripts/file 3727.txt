When you're looking 
at petawatts, 
at petawattage, you've gotta be really clear about how much 
power and how much... 
not only the logistics 
of it, but... 
you just stick to writing 
your books, honey, okay? 
- I know it's... 
- I'm done with you. 
- I'm very sorry. 
- We're very, very close. 
We've mixed up a couple of 
verbals, it's not quite there yet, but we are so close, 
i just know it, 
I can feel it in my bones. 
You just gotta think 
of all the possibilities 
that parallel worlds offer us. I mean, some worlds are gonna 
be extremely different to ours. There'll be universes 
where there's no life. 
There'll be universes 
where there'll be no earth, 
or no solar system. 
There'll be universes 
where there would be 
people just like us, 
and almost identical. 
You wouldn't be able 
to distinguish them from us. 
So, it's an amazing range 
of possibilities 
that are gonna offer 
all sorts of spinoffs, as well. The whole idea of traveling 
between the universes 
is pretty wonderful. 
There are people in Japan 
working on it, 
and in Russia, 
Page 2/29
of course the military 
are very interested. 
Darpa, the American organization that works with developing 
technology for the military 
are very keen, because sadly 
it can be used 
as some sort of weapon... 
- I'm home! 
- Hello. 
- Oh, mom, they're mine. 
- Thanks, darling. 
That's gross. 
- How was your run? 
- Oh, it was torture. 
I hate exercise. 
So, no French toast 
for you then, huh? 
- Hey? Huh? 
- What? 
Get out! 
Oh, no, no, no, no. 
You're in training, fatty. 
There are choices. 
- Choices. 
- Screw you. 
Huh? Come on. 
- Let's go, you two. 
- I'll have a shower first. 
- Lunch, usual spot? 
- Perfect. 
Let's go! 
Just... it'll be 
ready soon, I promise. 
Yeah, I know, 
it just... it takes time. 
Look... no, no, no, 
we're been logging all that. 
Yes. Yeah, I sent the report 
through last week. 
It's kind of not my department. Um, yeah, absolutely. 
Look, look, with all due 
respect, it's really not... 
Page 3/29
Dawkins, hi, yes... 
yes, I am absolutely aware 
we have passed the deadline, 
but we are so close. 
No, there's no 
positive results yet, 
but in theory we... 
no, I understand. 
Yes, a month. 
Thank you. 
I'll be in touch. 
- I hate them pushing me like that. - What, a month? 
- Yup. 
- Jesus. 
Well, luckily today 
i am wearing my special shirt. - Doesn't that need a wash? 
- Well, I would then wash out the mojo. All right, have you got 
the parameters set? 
Yeah, but can you 
double check them? 
I don't want to be blamed 
for any mistakes. 
Oh, shut up. 
All right, we'll aim 
for six second teleport. 
Roger that. 
Place the subject 
in the center, please. 
...Coils 
are fully charged. 
- Any sign of trouble, abort, okay? - Got it. 
We'll start at 50 petawatts. 
I'm going to 100. 
Okay, your side? 
Yup, all good. 
Okay. 
Going to 150. 
Slowly. 
Regg, take it offline. 
Bummer. 
Page 4/29
I almost blew 
the whole system today. 
Ouch. 
Dawkins is threatening 
to shut us down in a month. 
What? 
It's been five years... 
- And he could just shut it down. - But you're close, right? 
Yes, no, i think so. 
How close are the Japanese? 
Don't even talk 
to me about that. 
The money they have, 
the facilities they have, 
we're a tiny little outfit. 
- They're not there yet. 
- No, they're not, 
but the deadlines are stupid, 
breathing down our neck. 
- How are we supposed to get anything done? - Mm-hmm, I understand. 
My publisher always wants 
the book, like, yesterday. 
Why do I just wanna 
run away sometimes? 
Cause you're impatient. 
That's all. 
If I did, would you 
come with me? 
No. 
Well, that's me. 
I'm out. 
- You? 
- No, I'm fine. 
I'm gonna stay on. 
The night is young! 
- Ciao. 
- Ciao. 
Mmm. 
I'm so sorry I'm late. 
Do you think we could 
have some takeaway? 
No need. Your sister dropped by 
Page 5/29
with lasagna. 
- It's in the oven. 
- Lasagna? 
Why did she do that? 
Thought you needed fattening up. Oh, shut up. 
Okay. 
We're having an affair. 
What? 
You wouldn't dare. 
Why? 
Dad? 
Oh, give me an out. 
Yes, Jake? 
The Internet's not working. 
Read a book! 
So commercial teleportation 
is just around the next corner. There are teams 
in Japan working on it, 
and in Russia, 
but scientists have to be brave, and bold, and courageous, 
and take risks. 
I mean, that's what it's all... but scientists have to be brave, and bold, and courageous, 
and take risks. 
Okay, it's a final adjustment. Should be ready. 
I'm starting with 200 petawatts. Are you crazy? 
We could blow the grid. 
We don't have time 
to be cautious, regg, 
- just do it. 
- All right, but... 
I'm starting with 200 petawatts. Okay, taking it to 200. 
Holy shit. 
Oh, my god. 
Well, it should be in here. 
Where the hell is it? 
Uh... I'll check 
Page 6/29
the sensor data. 
It's just disappeared 
into thin air. 
Some would call that magic. 
Just think what we've done. 
Just... just think 
what we've done. 
We've... we've disassembled 
organic matter. 
Is it too soon to celebrate? 
Well, technically, 
we're only halfway there. 
Oh, my god, i need a drink. 
Matt? 
- Jane? 
- Matt? 
Just... our kids. 
What's wrong? 
I love them. 
Where are you? 
I love you, Jane. 
Matt? 
Matt! 
Hi, you've called Matt. 
I'm not here at the moment. 
Just leave a message, and I will call you back as soon as I can. Have a nice day. 
What the hell? 
Oh, my god. 
Oh, my god! 
Mom? 
Mom? 
- Mom! Mom, wake up! 
- Oh, god. 
...What are you doing? 
Sorry. I'll get 
some breakfast. 
It's fine. 
Don't worry about it. 
- We can do it. 
- Shush, I'll get some. 
It's all right. Let's have 
some eggs or something. 
Page 7/29
Mom, please, can you just stop? Do you guys wanna start 
with your homework? 
I need to speak to your mom. 
Jane? 
Jane? 
- Jane. 
- Oh. 
- Oh, oh, god, the kids! 
- It's all right. 
It's all right. 
They're downstairs. 
Jake phoned, i picked them up. Oh, Christ. 
Jane, I know that this is hard, you know, we all agreed that 
the kids should go back to school after three weeks 
to keep them busy. 
You need to do the same thing. I just don't think i can go on without him, Ruth, I really don't. He was always there for me, 
and I was just always 
wrapped up in my own work. 
Don't be so hard on yourself. 
The worst thing 
is that when he called me, 
ruthie, he said he loved me, 
he said he loved the kids, 
and I didn't get to say 
that I love you back. 
Oh, god. 
Jane. 
It'll be okay. 
With the other link 
the receiver. 
Then... 
...Jane. 
Yeah, listen, I've been running through the data on our last test. Yeah? 
What if the apple did make it 
to the receiver? 
Page 8/29

But... but it didn't. 
The chamber was empty. 
- Remember? 
- No our chamber was empty, regg. I'm not following. 
You've heard 
of tegmark's theory? 
What? Of parallel worlds? 
Oh, hey... 
what are you saying? 
I'll see you in ten. 
I've crosschecked the data, 
- you could be right. 
- I am right. 
I think we sent an apple 
to a parallel world. 
I don't know, I can't even 
begin to comprehend... 
and if we are right, 
there should be 
one of these chambers, 
and scientists studying 
everything that we're studying in that parallel world. 
Yeah, but you're assuming 
it's a level one, 
or a level three parallel world, in tegmark's theory, 
but if it's a level two world, then our laws of physics 
- may not even apply. 
- Listen, for our purposes, 
let's just assume 
it's a level one or three world. In which case, my question is, why haven't they sent 
something back? 
Um... 
maybe... maybe they've got 
the wrong frequency. 
Maybe? 
Maybe they haven't 
cracked it yet. 
Let's send them our parameters. Page 9/29

350 petawatts. 
Bi-shifted coils. 
that's it. 
No more. Just that. 
Just send that. 
We'll send it at 350. 
Okay, your side, regg? 
Ready. 
It's going well. 
- What now? 
- We wait. 
There is nothing like 
a late breakfast. 
Mine's a bit burnt. 
A bit? 
You're lucky. 
Well, as your dad used to say, extra flavor. 
- Regg? 
- -Guess what? 
Don't mess with me. 
Just come down here. 
Tell me. 
Well? 
I haven't touched it. 
Is this some kind of joke? 
No! 
No way. 
That's so funny. 
I wonder what 
their world is like. 
Maybe they're more 
advanced than us. 
Well, not likely. 
We made the first move. 
The real question is... 
i mean, who are they? 
Well, they're humanoid, 
at least. 
There must be a better way 
of communicating. 
Let's us this. 
This thing's an antique. You sure they're gonna know how to use it? 
Page 10/29
Shut up. 
Get it in there. 
Oh, my god. 
Oh, my god. 
Plug it in. 
Oh! 
Our lab. 
It's them. 
- Whoa! 
- Are they chambers? 
Here is our data collection. 
Oh wait, hang on, here we go. 
It's, um... 
whoa! 
I'm Jane Chandler. 
- Holy shit. 
- Congratulations. 
We have been working on this 
for a long time, and... 
- thanks for sending us the... - that's... that's you. 
Parameters. 
Hi. What? 
What are you doing here? 
Um, I've got... 
I've gotta go. Bye. 
I mean, tegmark's right. 
It is a parallel world. 
And... so everyone over there 
is the same as here? 
Everyone. 
Everything slightly different. And there's another version 
of me over there right now? 
Oh, heaven help us. 
Oh, my god. 
So... so what 
do we do now? 
Uh, well, what can we do 
from an ethical perspective? 
Well, it would be great to 
find out more about their world. Maybe, you know, maybe they have medical breakthroughs that we don't. 
Page 11/29
Maybe they've got 
cures for cancer. Maybe... 
I wonder what their 
computer systems are like. 
We could go across. 
No, no way, that's way 
too dangerous. 
What? Look, 
the apple was fine. 
The camera went across, 
came back. 
Files were completely intact. 
That's completely different. 
It's an apple. 
How is it different? 
Well, if any of the parameters fluctuate even by a micron 
during the process, 
then our DNA will disassemble 
and it won't... 
it won't be pretty. 
Yeah, you're right. 
This is too dangerous. 
If something were 
to happen to me... 
would you... would you be able to look after the kids? 
Jane, you're gonna be fine. 
It's just the worst case 
scenario. 
Well, of course, I would 
look after your kids. 
They're family, and I love them. And I love you, too, okay? 
No. 
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
You're supposed to be dead. 
No. No, no. 
I'm... I'm alive. 
And I'm fine. 
I'm going crazy. 
I'm going crazy. 
And the kids are fine, too. 
We don't have kids. 
Page 12/29
Hold on a minute. 
All right. 
You... you know 
about my job, 
and the work that we're 
trying to achieve at the lab? 
Right? 
It worked. 
Now, you just said 
that... that I died, 
but in my world, 
where I come from, 
you died in a car accident 
just about a mile from here. 
That's the way you died. 
- We have kids? 
- We've got two. 
Can you take me there? 
Can you take me there? 
I can try. 
Oh, my god, no. 
No, no, no, no, no. 
Oh, Jesus. 
What have you done? 
- Oh. 
- Will you just cool it? 
Cool it? 
Are you mad? 
You can't just go dragging 
people across the dimensions. 
Oh, can't I? Who's research 
project is this, anyway? 
Oh, oh, wow. 
I mean, there are so many 
things to consider here. 
There are ethics. 
The quantum physics. 
I am well aware 
of what's at stake. 
Oh, my god. 
How are you going to explain 
that your husband 
is back from the dead? 
It's all fixable, regg. 
Page 13/29

Fixable? 
What about your kids? 
I mean, what are 
they gonna think? 
They want their 
father back, regg. 
I'm okay. 
Jane. 
I'm home! 
Oh! 
- Oh, hello. 
- What a surprise. 
Hi. Oh, look, ruthie... 
you look tired. 
- Thanks. 
- You okay? 
Sorry. 
- Yeah? 
- You know what? Why don't you... why don't you have 
an early night 
because I thought I might 
take the kids to the movies. 
- Sweet, yes. 
- -Yes. 
- Oh, okay. 
- Yeah? 
But don't... 
but just leave it all... 
just walk away, 
cause I can do it, 
and I'm so thankful. 
- I love you. 
- I love you, too. 
- You good? 
- Yes, I'm good. 
- Beautiful. 
- I love you. 
- You, too. 
- -Bye-bye. 
- Bye. See ya. 
- -Thank you. 
- Bye, I love you. 
- -Geez, that was a bit sudden, mom. Page 14/29

Oh, yes, yeah. 
It was. 
Um... 
Sammy, can you put that down? 
Yeah, just... 
I need to tell you something. 
You know... I've told you 
a little bit about my work. 
Right? How we're working 
to teleport things 
much like in... 
"Star Trek." 
We just could 
make things disappear, 
but not reappear. 
Anyway, this is 
our world, right? 
This is our universe. 
Scientists believe 
that at the same time 
this world is existing, 
other worlds are existing, 
and scientists call them 
parallel worlds, okay? 
Now, some of them 
that they believe 
are vastly different from ours, but here's the really 
important thing, 
is some of those universes, 
some of those worlds, 
are really similar. 
And... and... 
that's it. 
That's it, that's... 
that's what we discovered. 
We figured out where 
the apple went. 
And it went to a world 
that was really similar to ours. And I know this, 
because I went there. 
And when I went there, 
i found dad. 
Page 15/29
What do you mean 
you found dad, mom? 
Well, it's just like an 
identical version of your dad, because in his world, 
you see, dad didn't die. 
You're being serious 
about this, right? 
Would I joke about 
something like this? 
Would I put you through it? 
Where is he now? 
Is... is he here now? 
Well, he's down 
the road in a car. 
That's why, you know, 
i had to get rid of Ruth, 
but nobody can know this, Sam. - Down the road? 
- Yeah, wait, Sam, wait! 
Where is he, mom? 
I... I don't know. 
I... I left him here. 
Dad? 
I made some tea. 
And some sugar? 
Oh, I don't take it. 
Oh. 
You okay, Jake? 
Yeah, I'm... 
I'm fine. 
Look, can we just 
hang on for a second? 
I mean, if you're here, 
doesn't that mean that the... 
the other Sam and the other me in the other world... 
aren't they missing their dad? Oh, where I come from there 
is no you and Samantha. 
But mom, I thought you said 
everything was identical. 
Similar. 
Not identical. 
Page 16/29
Well, what about the other mom? Isn't she missing you? 
Isn't she? 
Look, I know this 
is gonna sound weird, 
but in dad's world, I died 
in a car accident, not dad. 
- What. 
- What? 
It's okay, Sam, 
I'm... I'm... 
listen, you know, I think that's probably enough questions for now. - It's been a big couple of days. - Yeah. 
I'm tired. 
Do you wanna lie down? 
Cause you could... 
the bedroom... 
the second room on the right. 
The most important thing 
is that we don't tell anyone 
that dad's back. 
Just don't want 
to lose him again. 
Yeah, no worries, mom. 
- Hey. 
- Hey. 
How are you feeling? 
I'm okay. 
I've missed you. 
Feels like a dream. 
Oh, to wake up and you be gone. I'm never gonna leave you. 
Promise me. 
I promise. 
How are the eggs? 
- Good. 
- They're perfect. 
I'm home. 
- Oh. 
- -Madame. 
Ooh, thank you. 
Jesus, you scared me. 
Page 17/29
Oh, my god. 
Sorry. Didn't want 
to disturb you. 
Well, you know, you could try 
knocking next time. 
It's so beautiful here. 
It's nothing like my world. 
Are you happy? 
You're the best thing 
that ever happened to me. 
- That really hurt! 
- Sorry. 
The other Jane 
used to like that. 
Well, I'm not the other Jane. 
- Come here. 
- Oh, my god. 
Mmm. 
What's that? 
Well, that's self defense. 
Self defense against what? 
Well, my world is violent. 
How's it work? 
Fires a charge. 
What, like a taser? 
...Careful. 
It's got quite a kick. 
Hmm. 
All he does is play video games. I can hear through my wall. 
He says, "oh, mom, 
I'm studying." 
And, yet, I can hear it 
through my wall late at night. You don't have to study 
when you already know it. 
Oh, "you don't have to study 
when you already know it." 
- I do the work at school. 
- Said every fail ever. 
He's got apps that are right, 
but that, you know. 
- Grandma, hi. 
- Jake. 
Page 18/29
How are you, my darling? 
- I'm good. 
- How's your mother? 
Hi, mom. 
- What have you got? 
- What happened to your lip? 
Oh, I, um, I bit it in my sleep. Listen, I'm just passing, 
brought you... 
I'm very sorry, but mom, 
look, I'd ask you in, 
but we're not... 
we're going out. 
- Samantha. 
- Hi, grandma. 
Have you got a guest here? 
Why would you ask that? 
There are four plates out. 
That's mine, um, i... 
i had an extra serving. 
Yeah... 
well, I won't keep you. 
Look, thank you so much, mom. 
- Call me if you need anything. - I will, absolutely. 
I'm sorry. 
- Bye. 
- -Bye, grandma. 
Where is he? 
Hey! 
Hey, you! 
Matt? 
Matt, it is you. 
Hey, you're supposed to be dead. Insurance scam, right? 
Hey, wow, so, um, 
how much did you get? 
Let me guess, um, 
you got a million. 
You got a million, right? 
Where's he gone? 
I've no idea. 
Hey! Hey! 
Hey, I'll do you a favor. 
Page 19/29
A favor? 
Yeah, favor, if you 
do one for me. 
I'll keep your secret. 
All you have to do is break me off a little slice. 
Hey, don't you 
walk away from me! 
Matt! Matt! 
Let's talk about this. 
Matt. 
- Hey. 
- Hey, that's it? 
Hey? You disappeared for half the afternoon, and it's just "hey"? Where the hell have you been? 
I just wanted to look around. 
You can't just go 
looking around. 
What if somebody sees you? 
What are we gonna say? 
- How do we explain it? 
- Okay. 
It's different here. 
I just kept walking. 
I won't leave you again. 
You just had me worried. I just... please don't do that again. 
You must be so happy. 
What? 
Your family. 
What were you doing 
in Samantha's room? 
Seeing my daughter 
lying there was... 
Extraordinary. 
She's beautiful. 
Yeah, she is. 
This is all really 
new to me, Jane. 
I'm sorry if I upset you. 
Hey, stranger. 
Hi. 
So, what are we gonna 
Page 20/29
tell Dawkins? 
Nothing. 
But it's a huge breakthrough. 
And they're about 
to cut our funding. 
We have to tell them something. We'll hold off another week. 
Okay. 
So, how's Matt? 
He's fine. 
That good, huh? 
Good afternoon. 
Did you drive past here 
earlier today? 
Uh, yes, yes, I did. 
Did you see anything suspicious? According to witness reports, 
it appears the victim 
suffered severe burns... 
- hey! 
- Oh, hi. 
Uh, the police stopped me 
on the way home. 
What? 
Someone's been murdered 
at the park. 
Murder? 
You didn't notice anything, did you? No, I walked along the river. 
You okay? 
Yes, it's just in our 
backyard, that's all. 
- Hey! 
- Hey. 
Huh? What is that? 
- What is that? 
- It's really nothing. 
- And even when i... 
- what is this? 
...Why did you do that? 
I didn't... 
this is my work for school. 
Just give it back to me. 
You need to give it back. 
Page 21/29

- Okay, that's stupid. 
- What's going on? 
- It's stupid. Look. 
- What? 
It's insulting. 
Okay? That's what it is. 
...Oh, I'm so sorry. 
Oh, shh, sweetheart. 
It's all right. 
He just needs... 
he just needs a little bit 
more time to settle in. 
That's all he... 
mom, he's weird. 
Stupid. 
We just need a bit more time 
to get used to him. 
- He doesn't have children. 
- Mom. 
You don't even know him. 
Matt, will you open the door? 
We need to talk. 
Matt. 
Matt. 
Are you in there? 
Can you... 
can you open the door, please? We need to talk. 
"Can you open the door, please? We need to talk." 
Matt, can you open the door? 
We need to talk. 
"Matt, can you open the door, 
we need to talk." 
- You really frightened the kids. - I didn't mean to. 
I overreacted. 
I'm so sorry. 
I don't know. 
Maybe... maybe it's my fault. 
Maybe I'm just expecting 
too much of you. 
Should I send the kids to 
grandma's for a couple of days or... Page 22/29

do you need time? 
I'm fine with that. 
Are you happy here, 
you know, with me? 
Do you mean do I want 
to go back? 
No, no, I didn't... 
i didn't say... say that. 
Are you threatening me, Jane? 
No, no. 
No, I'm not. 
I wouldn't do that. 
Okay. 
I don't wanna go back. 
Yeah, okay. 
Where are we going? 
We're gonna go to auntie Ruth's. Matt? 
I hope Samantha can forgive me. Well, uh, you know, 
you scared them, so... 
where you headed? 
After I drop the kids off, 
I'll be going to the lab. 
Will regg be there? 
Yeah, he's my assistant. 
He's more than that. 
What? 
Matt? 
I think you're right. 
I think it was a mistake 
to bring him here. 
Okay, uh, what are you gonna do? I want to go back to his world. I wanna look into his life. 
He's not leaving, regg. 
He's made it very clear. 
He is not going anywhere. 
I need to go back. 
I'll boot it up. 
Thank you. 
I've been doing a few 
experiments at home, 
and I've been building 
Page 23/29
some more equipment, 
- and I think I've found... 
- regg... 
- just later. 
- Yeah, sure. 
You ready? 
Ready. 
Hello? 
Matt, what are you doing here? Where's Jane? 
Can i... can i... 
can I help you with something? Oh, oh, please, just don't 
touch any of the equipment, 
it's, um, it's very sensitive. Can i... can I get you 
a drink, or something? 
Uh, and they're 
touch screens, so... 
please, don't touch. 
What are you doing? No! 
Action parameter on. 
The fox modulator is on. 
Okay. 
Do you realize what you've done? All right. 
What's going on? 
Why isn't it working? 
It should be working. 
It should be working. 
Why isn't it working? 
- Where you heading? 
- I'm going to the lab. 
Oh, no, you bastard! 
Oh, god. 
Hey you, you're finally back. 
Did you miss me? 
Regg? How... how... 
how did you get here? 
Um, in my car, like normal. 
I'm feeling much better, 
thanks for asking. 
Hey, how come you haven't 
been answering your phone? 
Page 24/29
I've called you, like, 20 times. Did Matt confiscate 
your phone again? 
Why aren't you wearing 
your uniform? 
I like it. 
What? Regg! 
Okay. 
I almost... I almost got it 
working last night. 
- What? 
- I tried a few tests. 
I couldn't get the petawatts 
to stabilize, but I'm so close. Wait! What? 
You have one of these 
machines at your house? 
Yeah, like we discussed. 
You gotta take me there. 
My place? 
Sorry about the mess inside. 
It's been a crazy week. 
Tell me about it. 
So, this is what you wanted 
to talk to me about. 
- You've been busy. 
- It's all here. 
Just a few teething 
problems though. 
What are you doing? 
Do you have a screwdriver? 
Why? 
Cause I know how 
to make it work. 
Right, that's... 
should do it. 
This is exciting. 
Yeah. 
What? We're testing now? 
Yeah. 
Are you crazy? 
Possibly. 
I need you to push the slider 
to 350 petawatts. 
Page 25/29
Whoa! We could blow 
the entire grid! 
You've heard of tegmark's 
theory of parallel worlds? 
- Yeah. 
- I've proven it. 
What? 
You've done this before? 
Yes. 
Well, I'm coming with you. 
350 petawatts. 
It's a parallel world. 
Yeah. 
Oh, it feels like 
a really bad hangover. 
Yeah. 
Oh, this is amazing. 
Trust me, you'll get used to it. - We need a car, regg. 
- Where are we going? 
I've gotta get to my place. 
Come on. 
What are you doing? 
Seizing my initiative. 
What? 
Oh, my god. 
- I need you to stay here. 
- Sure. 
- What's that for? 
- It's just a precaution. 
When you're looking 
at petawatts, at petawattage, 
you've gotta be really clear about how much power... the logistics of it... you just stick 
to writing your books, honey. 
- Okay? I'm done with you. 
- -I'm very sorry. 
We're very, very close. 
We've mixed up in a couple of 
verbals, it's not quite there yet, but we are so close, 
i just know it, 
I can feel it in my bones. 
Page 26/29
Regg is nearly there. 
- What happened? 
- We're in the wrong world. 
What? 
Go! 
You changed the parameters? 
Yeah, yeah, i... 
well, I think we're good to go. This is kind of exhilarating. 
Listen, regg... 
There's something i... 
i have to tell you. 
Your Jane is dead. 
My Jane? 
What? 
I'm from a different 
world to yours. 
What do you mean dead? 
How? 
I think it was Matt. 
I think he's killed her. 
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
Police, open up! 
He's got my kids. 
I have to get home. 
- Regg, I have to go, i... 
- just go. Go now! 
- I'll wait for you. 
- No, I'm staying here. 
- What? Here? 
- Just go! 
What the hell is this? 
Surprise. 
Yes? 
Hello. 
Who is this? 
Jane asked me to call you. 
- I'm her new assistant. 
- What happened to regg? 
You won't be seeing him again. What do you want exactly? 
She wants me 
to pick up the kids. 
Are they with you? 
Page 27/29
No, probably at Ruth's. 
Do you want the number? 
Actually, i need the address. 
Oh, god. 
Oh, regg. 
Oh, god. 
Ruth! 
Anybody home? 
Jake, Ruth? 
Ruth? 
Samantha? 
- This is Ruth. 
- Oh, god, Ruth! 
- Jane? 
- Thank god. 
- Are you okay? 
- Yeah, listen are the kids with you? Yes, we're heading 
to your home now. 
Jane? 
Listen, I've gotta go. 
Just wait for me there, okay? 
You okay? 
Just wait for me there. 
Jane! 
Ruth? 
Samantha? 
Jane! 
Samantha! 
Open the door! 
- Mom? 
- -Oh, god. 
Mom, are you okay? 
What's going on? 
I thought I'd lost 
you, too. Oh, Samantha. 
Jane, what's going on? 
Lock the door. 
He's gone crazy. 
- We have to hide. 
- What? From who? 
I don't have time to explain. 
You have to trust me. 
We have to hide. 
Page 28/29
Anyone there? 
How the hell did you get back? I saw what you did to her. 
She was the one 
having the affair. 
That's no justification. 
It was to me. 
Oh! 
Oh! 
Holy shit. 
What do we do now? 
I'm coming back for you, bitch. Where's he going, mom? 
A long, long way away from us. Ah. 
Ooh! We better get going. 
We'll be late. 
Yeah. 
Have a great day, guys. 
- Be good. 
- Always, mom. 
- Bye. 
- Yeah, right. 
And, bye. 
Are we meeting later for coffee? Sounds great. 
- At the lab? 
- Yes. 
Something terrible's happened. You're in the wrong world.
