In the shadow
of the big city,

with its big buildings,
big business, and big people,

is my home town Tromaville.

A little town
with little buildings,

little businesses,
and little people.

My name is Melvin Junko.

I live in a garden apartment
in the Tromaville Dump.

I am the first
hideously deformed monster hero

of superhuman size
and strength

to come from New Jeresy.

They call me
the Toxic Avenger.

This is my story.

Several years ago,

I and the little people
of Tromaville

succeeded in crushing
all criminals

and ridding Tromaville
once and for all

of evil and corruption.

Tromaville actually became
a nice place to live.

With no criminals or oppressive
politicians around,

people of Tromaville were
once again happy.

Once again they were free
to devote themselves

to their principal activities
of dancing in the streets...

tattooing...

manufacturing orange juice...

exterminating vermin...

watching excellent movies...

and dancing in the streets!

The important people
in my life

all lived in Tromaville--
My Mom,

It's your Mommy!
Melvin!

My freudian psychiatrist,

I've been doing
some soul searching of my own.

And most important,
my best girl Claire.

Although Claire was blind,

her handicap didn't
prevent her

from being
a real intellectual.

Now that Tromaville
had no crime,

there was no work
for a super hero like me.

There were no criminals left
for me to destroy.

I took a job
as concierge

at the Tromaville Center
for the blind,

where Claire spent
much of her time.

It was the only way
to make ends meet.

Claire had the kind of end

that you really wanted
to meet.

I was also athletic director

at the Center of the blind,

which kept me
kind of busy.

My duties included
organizing croquet games,

planning rooftop nature walks,

and refereeing
basketball games.

As rewarding
as this work was,

I have to admit
I was pretty depressed.

I missed the good old days
of criminal bashing.

You know,
beating up bad guys.

Then... one day our lives
were thrown into upheaval.

The peace and tranquility

to which we had grown
accustomed

was suddenly shattered!

Claire.

Yes, Mrs. Beasley.

Oooh!

Your boyfriend,
the Toxic whatchihoosit,

is melting all the silverware
in the house.

Oh, dear!

Melvin!

You don't have to set
the table tonight.

Why don't you clean
the oven?

OK, dear.

I suppose you want me
to clean the toilets, too.

Yes, dear.
Thank you.

Attention, all blind people.

Lunch is now
being served inside.

All blind persons
please find your way

to the cafeteria.

Poor Melvin.

He's been
so depressed lately.

His psychiatrist says
it's very important

for him to feel needed.

There just doesn't seem
to be any more evil

in Tromaville
for him to clean up.

It's not good for him
to feel useless.

( Bell Rings )

Mr. Chairman,

that's the Toxic Avenger's
girlfriend.

Ha ha ha!

He must be inside.

OK.

Give the order.

OK, you,
come on. Let's go.

Mmmph!

Mmmph!

Get a receipt.

( Ticking )

Excuse me, miss.

Oh, sorry.

I got a package here
for the Toxic Avenger.

He's inside working.

Could you sign
for it, please?

OK.

No. Right down here.

OK. Thank you.

What is it?

Make sure he gets it,
because it's awfully big.

It feels nice.

Ohhh!

Oh, Toxie! Oh! Oh!

I have a surprise!

I have a surprise
for Toxie!

He's going to be
so excited.

Oh! Oh! Oh!

Help me! Help me!

I'm stuck!
The lunch bell rang!

Lady! Lady!

Help me! I'm stuck!

Let go of me!
What are you, blind?

Clarie! Clarie!

Ha ha ha!

Aaah!

Clarie!

Oh, my god!
Mrs. Beasley!

Mrs. Beasley!
Are you all right?

Aaah! Aaah!

Oh, my god!

Aaah!

Help me! Help me!

Come on! Let's go!

Ha ha ha!

All right!

Man! That old lady,
I wasted her!

Good boy!
We pulled it off.

All right!

Ha ha ha!

I should be getting

a big raise
out of this job.

We made waste product
out of that Toxic bastard.

I love to watch things
blow up.

Did you see that blast?

Ha ha ha!

That's the end
of the Toxic Avenger.

Ha ha ha!

Grrr!

Grrr!

Ha ha ha!

We're changing
this town now!

Did you see
that blast?

Oh, yeah.

Grr!

How are ya?

Aaah!

Grrr!

Help!

Grrr!

Oh! Oh! Oh!

( Bones Crack )

Aaah!

Grrr!

Messy, messy, messy!

Get him!

Come on! take him!

He's yours.

Grrr!

Aaaah!

Mmmph.

Take this.

f*ck this!

Now you gotta deal with me,
Toxic as*h*le.

Why, I ought a...

( Birds Tweeting )

Grrr!

Take him.

Let's go.
Get on with it.

Come on!

Get that
Toxic Avenger.

Come on!

All the men
we've got!

He's all yours.

Get that
for the chief!

Hey, Toxic.

Hey, Toxic!

What's the matter?
Can't you hear me?

You slimebucket, you!

Can't you hear me?
Hey, Toxic!

Aaah!

Aaah!

Yeah, kemo sabe.

I can hear you.

Can you hear me?

Ughhh!

( Beep Beep )

Lucky for you, it's time
for my piano lesson.

Take this,
you savage, Toxic, you.

Yeee!

( Click Click )

Ahhh!

Ahhh!

Aaah!

One of our best men.

Ya ha ha ha!

Ha ha ha!

Ha ha ha!

Grr!

Ya!

Yaa!

Aaah!

Grrr!

What are you
doing to me?

What are you
doing to me?

After a long day
of crime fighting,

I like to play
a little basketball.

Grr!

Hee hee hee!

Oh, sh*t!

I-I-I don't know.

I mean, he's big.

and we planned it well,
and I--

I didn't know--

Call a meeting of the board
of directors,

and fire the entire
personnel department!

He's coming.
Let me in!

Ohh!

Waah!

Oh, little baby.

Don't cry.
I got you.

Let's go find
your mommy.

Aaah! Aaah!
Oh, my god!

Aaah! Aaah!

Oh, my god!
Where 's my baby!

Where is she?
Where is she?

Here you go, ma'am.
Here's your baby.

She was up a tree.

Thank you, Toxic.

They k*lled my Melvin.

Melvin! They k*lled
my Melvin!

Oh, Melvin!

Aaah! Aaah!

Apocalypse Chemicals!

Grrr!

Claire! Claire!

Claire!

Are you all right?

Thank God
you're all right!

I thought
they k*lled you!

What happened?

I felt the heat
and a terrible sound.

And then I felt
a head!

Where is everyone?

Where's Mrs. Beasley?

Clarie! They were...

They were senselessly
butchered!

Ohh, Melvin!

But at least I got the slime
who did it.

Oh, Melvin,
you're wonderful.

Oh, Claire.

Claire may have thought
I was wonderful,

but across the river
in the big city

there were some big people
who didn't think

I was so wonderful.

The Evil, Egomaniacal Chairman
of Apocalypse Incorporated,

the massive, Multinational
Chemical Conglomerate

plotting to destroy me
and take over Tromaville.

As long as
the Toxic Avenger lives,

we will be prevented
from achieving our goals.

We will never win over
the hearts and minds

of all the little people
of Tromaville,

whom we need

because without them,
we'll never take Tromaville.

And without Tromaville,
we'll never take New York.

And without New York,
we're just an infernal failure!

Bu-bu-but, Boss,
we can't k*ll him!

We used enough expl*sives
to blow up an entire city.

So what if our expl*sives
had no effect.

We are Apocalypse
incorporated.

We do not shrink
at setbacks.

We want the challenge!

Gentlemen, as we speak,

our research department
is studying his background,

and we will come up
with a suitable demise

for that Toxic
troublemaker.

And then...

Ha ha!

I'll get a hold

of that blonde, blind, bimbo,
whore, b*tch girlfriend of his

with those long legs-- Ooh!

And those
melon-heavy breasts.

I'd like
to take her hair

and wrap it
around her neck!

I want to strangle her
till her eyes bugged out!

( Clap )

His real name
is Melvin Junko.

He was nothing
but a puny janitor

At a health club.

In reel two
of the first movie,

As a result
of a harmless prank,

Melvin fell into a barrel
of toxic waste.

This caused his tiny body
to transform

into a hideously deformed
creature

of superhuman size
and strength.

He became...
The Toxic Avenger.

Due to the toxic chemicals
in his body,

Melvin destroyed all the evil
in Tromaville.

Tromaville actually became
a nice place to live.

You see, the chemicals
in the Toxic Avenger's body

cause him to automatically
destroy evil.

Our scientists say
this is caused

by weird particles in his body
called Tromations.

To destroy
the Toxic Avenger,

we must destroy
the Tromations in his body.

How do we conquer
this tromation?

Technology.

And where do we
find technology?

Gentlemen, think.

Cars...

TVs...

Walkmans.

Japan!

Anybody knows that if you
wany something to work,

you buy
a japanese product.

Even comic-book villains
like us know

if you want it done right,
you must turn to Japan.

( Pop )

Scientists at the Apocalypse
Japanese Division

will create
an anti-tromaton,

and then
that will be it.

That Toxic Avenger
will just shrivel up

like a prune.

Speaking of prunes,
that girlfriend of his--

Ha ha ha!
I would just love

to shrivel up
those melons of hers!

Boy, I could
get my hands on...

Wait a minute.

You said this
anit-tromaton substance

is in Japan.

Can we get this
from Japan

to New Jersey?

That would be
very chancy,

considering
its volatile nature.

However, we have a plan

to get the Toxic Avenger
to Japan.

He's been seeing
a psychiatrist.

We know he has
complete faith in her.

It's just a matter
of determining her price.

No problem.

We'll get that jerk...

no matter what.

Now, that is what
I like to hear!

He...

must...

be...

destroyed.

Beating up bad guys

should've made me feel good
about myself,

but back
at our garden apartment,

I was still experiencing
feeling of uselessness

and subseguent bouts
of deep depression.

So many innocent blind people
had died

before I could do anything
to save them.

I went into a real
emotional tailspin.

I was in such a state,
Claire even suggested

I increase
my psychiatrist visits

to eight times a week

instead of
the usual seven.

This should make you
feel better.

Ergh...

ha ha!

Melvin, I made
your favorite.

It's your favorite!

Ta-da!

Chicken a la...

Clorox.

Oh, well,
all right.

Melvin, must you always

smother my cooking
in drano

before you even
taste it?

I'm sorry, OK?

I'm sorry, Claire.

I...

I just feel so useless.

Oh, Melvin, you were great
this morning--

The way
you took apart

all those
smelly men.

There's still evil
in Tromaville

for you
to clean up.

( Gagging )

Plenty of evil
for you!

Grrgh.

I should've
been faster!

All those innocent
blind people...

are dead.

( Amazing Grace Playing )

I couldn't snap out
of my depression.

Usually I felt better
after sunday church services,

but not this time.

My psychiatrist had attributed
my emotional problems

to the face
that I was raised

in a single-parent
household,

my father having left home
when I was a tiny baby.

But I always felt

that Mom had more than
filled the void

when Dad left.

Mom had been
a great father figure.

Uhh...

The clouds of despair
followed me everywhere.

Uhh...

And I mean everywhere.

( Splat )

Uh!

Oh!

( Farting )

Please, darling,

try to eat
something.

There's some nice
cleaning fluid

under the sink.

I've got to go now.

I've got
a bar mitzvah.

Shall I bring you
something

from the supermarket?

Some sani-flush, maybe?

Oy, oy, oy! Oh!

It wasn't long

before I became a genuine
emotional basket case.

( Sobbing )

I was so depressed

that I didn't even notice
that my psychiatrist,

who had always been
a strict freudian,

suddenly began practicing

some kind of progressive
new gestalt psychotherapy.

... that the mind,
though important,

is only one very
small part of the whole.

The rest, Melvin,
is the flesh!

The flesh!

The flesh and sex!

It is sex
which links us

to our innermost selves.

I should have surmised

that the evil
Apocalypse Corporation

had bought her off,

but because of
my monster-sized depression.

I was like Putty,

Toxic Putty in her hands.

Wow!

It all sounds
so complicated.

I mean,
where would I begin?

Oh, where
we all must begin.

And where's that?

With your father!

My father?

My father left
when I was a child.

I don't
even know him.

But that's only
a very small obstacle.

I've done some checking.

I discovered that
your father Phineas T. Junko,

better known as Big Mac,

now lives
in Tokyo, Japan.

Oh. Tokyo, Japan.
Give me his address,

and I'll
drop him a line.

Oh, no, Melvin.

Oh, Melvin,
this is getting tedious.

You must go to him
and see him in person.

Me? Go to Japan?

Ohh! Uh-huh.

If I go there
and talk to my dad,

I can work things out?

Yes! Yes!

Japan, yeah.

But I have to leave
Mom and Claire.

On the other hand,
I could see Dad.

Daddy!

Daddy!

Japan. Japan.

But where is Japan?

Ooh!

That's delicious.

I'm hungry.

You know,

if Tromaville's here,

and Alaska's here,

and Japan's
all the way over here,

then I'm going to
have to travel

over these big
beautiful mountains.

Wow.
That's really far.

I think
that's even farther

than Tromaville
is to New York.

Claire, I don't
want to leave you.

Oh, but, Melvin,

I think
your doctor's right.

If you don't go to Japan
and find your daddy,

you'll never be happy.

Don't worry
about me, Melvin.

I'll be all right.

I'd be here
loving you the whole time.

Remember, Melvin,

I love you.

Grrr!

How could you
be so sure?

Oh, well,

My skin tingles all over
whenever I'm near you,

and I get
little hot sensations

all over my body.

And sometimes,
my mouth gets dry.

That could just be
a biochemical reflex.

Oh, no, Melvin.

Grrr!

Sometimes I see
little electric flashes

that light up
the darkness.

It's love, believe me.

Now, stop worrying
about me, Melvin.

It's our last day
together for a long while.

What do you
want to do?

Ooh! Oh!

( Whistle Blows )

Ha ha ha!

Grrr!

I was in such a hurry
to get to my father

that I bypassed the regularly
scheduled airlines

and took the fastest mode
of transportation to Japan.

At first I found it
hard to believe

that my dad was japanese

and that
I was part japanese.

But that would explain

why I've always had these
strange, nonamerican urges

to work very hard,
save money,

and live
without credit cards.

Mommy and Claire were worried
that I didn't prepare properly

for my trip to Tokyo,

but I bought a book
of japanese phrases

and rented a tape
of gidget goes to Tokyo.

What more did I need?

There was one little boo-boo
in my travel plans.

I forget my passport,

so when I got
to the Tokyo Harbor,

I ditched my windsurf board

and entered Tokyo
godzilla-style.

Grrr!

Grrr!

( Squeaking )

( Honk Honk )

Grrr! Grrr!

Am I in Paris or Tokyo?

Was I supposed to take
a left at the Panama Canal

or a right?

I don't know.

Let me start
looking for my father.

( Speaking Japanese )

- Oooh!
- Oooh!

Grrr!

Aah!

Aah!

Because I couldn't speak
japanese that well,

a waiter back at
the Tromaville Sushi Bar

gave me a napkin

with my father's name
written in japanese

so people could help me
find my father.

Grrr!

Yoo hoo! Guys!

Do you know where I could find
Mr. Mac Junko?

( Snoring )

Grrr!

Even though
I was far from home,

I kept up
all the good personal habits

my mom had taught me.

( Speaking Japanese )

And so I continued
my search for my father.

Aah!

( Crack! )

( Horn Honks )

Oh! Ooh!

Aah!

Hi.

Thanks.

Hmm. Those look good.
Can I have one?

What are they?

Very popular japanese snack
called Taiyaki.

In shape of fish.

Ah.

Ah.

Mmm.

Mmm!

( Speaking Japanese )

As I was munching
on my delicious Taiyaki,

suddenly my Tromations
began going Berserk.

Aah!

My body was reacting
to the presence of evil.

( Whistles )

( Smack! Smack! )

( Squealing )

Grrr!

Oh, genki desu ka, guys?

- Aah!
- Aah!

Aah!

Rrrr!

Would you
hold this, ma'am?

My Tromatons
are acting up.

Here.

Grrr!

( Blowing )

Aah!

Aaah!

Ita Nakimas.

Sumi masen.

Sumi masen, ladies.

Uh, sumi masen.

Shabu! Shabu!

No deki agari.

I've got
japanese shabu shabu here,

heavy on the veggies.

Aah!

( Speaking Japanese )

Grrr!

( Screams )

( Speaking Japanese )

Aah!

Fist lesson in electronics.

Your going to be first
human transmitter.

Shh!

( Buzzing )

Grrr!

She's all yours.

( Speaking Japanese )

Many thanks.

I'm forever
in your debt, kind sir.

Don't call me sir.

My name is Melvin.
Call me Melvin.

I am Masami.

Hajima mashita.

You put yourself
in terrible danger.

Not many men
would do that.

Well, actually,
I can't help it.

What?

I have these biochemical
particles in my body

called Tromatons.

I had an accident
a while back.

It affected
my biochemical makeup.

Every time
I sense evil,

these Tromatons
inside me

force me
to destroy it.

Still, I must
repay you for saving me.

I will do
whatever you wish.

Hmm?

Hey!

How about helping me
find my father?

Big Mac Junko.

Come. I have
many contacts on the street.

Masami and I searched
all over Tokyo for my father.

Grrr!

Let's go ask that
street-smart youth g*ng.

Maybe they know.

She introduced me

to all the tough
and savvy street people.

Do you know
Mr. Big Mac Junko?

( Machines Sounds )

Tokyo, like Tromaville,

was also
a nice place to live.

The people had many
interesting activities,

Like dancing
in the streets.

We didn't have much luck
finding my father.

I really started
to get bummed out.

The people of Tokyo
were terrific.

They did everything they could
to cheer me up.

I put on a happy face
and tried my best to have fun.

I'm hungry.

Oh, that looks good.

Here. Hold my mop.

You wait here.
I'll be right out.

Grrr!

Come on, follow me.
Mmm.

The plastic noodles
made my stomach full

but without my father
my life would never be full.

Do not be so sad,
Mr. Melvin.

We will find your
father.

I know. I know we will
but as if things weren't

bad enough already
all these people they

keep staring at me.
I feel so out of place.

No problem.
Come with me.

Pheww.

Masami disguised me

so I looked exactly like
a Typical Japanese Businessman.

Now I really fit right in.

I felt so much
more comfortable.

I looked and smelled
so professional,

I was sure Dad would be
real proud of me

if I could only locate him.

Meanwhile,
back in Tromaville,

the Chairman and his evil
Corporate Henchmen

were taking advantage
of my absence.

Apocalypse Incorporated
moved back into Tromaville

and systematically

began spreading
its Chemical Pollution

all over the entire town.

( Throwing Up)

Let's make use

of our newly acquired
property in Tromaville

to expand
our takeover project.

I believe you all
have work to do.

In a display
of incredibly evil arrogance,

the name of our town

was changed from Tromaville
to Apocalypseville,

And the people were helpless
to do anything about it.

Without me there
to fight evil,

Apocalypse Incorporated

was able to take over
all walks of life.

They took control of
Tromaville's industrial life.

Much worse,

they took control over
Tromaville's cultural life.

The little people
of Tromaville were miserable.

How was I to know?

I was , miles away

in a land where
they eat plastic noodles.

The Tromavillians tried
to protect their town

from the Chemical as*ault,

but they were powerless against
the Chairman and his g*ons.

You can't run away
from Chemicals

with though running away
from yourselves.

I say,
let's give back to nature

what came from nature.

Let's put back into the air
and the water and the earth

All the chemicals--

The fluorocarbons,
the DDT, the Dioxin

that lay there
for centuries undisturbed

before there was man
to come and pluck them out

and use them
for his own purposes.

The little people of Tromaville
bravely tried to stand tall.

They could do nothing

against the running dogs
of big business.

( Ruff! )

Protest Rally!

Help us stop
the Apocalypse Corporation!

There's
a big meeting tonight.

The Apocalypse
Corporation

is building a Chemical Plant
in our park.

Help us get ride of
the Apocalypse Corporation!

Stop Apocalypse!

Help us
get rid of them!

Please, keep
your neighborhood safe.

Stop Apocalypse from
building a Chemical Plant.

Fight the Apocalypse
Corportation.

Everybody,
the Apocalypse Corporation

wants to put a Chemical Plant
here in your park!

Some gutsy people
tried to resist,

but without me there,

All efforts
proved hopeless.

This park
is condemned, kid.

You can't
condemn a park.

Oh, yeah?
Just watch us.

That be your horse
over there?

Yeah.
No pollution.

Peace.

Well, that's
the next to go.

What's that smell?

Addicts!

You see
what they're smoking?

They're smoking crap.

Right.
They're crap addicts.

We won't let this Apocalypse
Corporation stop us.

Meet you back here later.

Walk on. Walk on.

And those forthright
Tromavillians

that Apocalypse Incorporated
couldn't control,

they crushed.

Ho. Ho.

Ho.

We never had dr*gs
in Tromaville

before this Apocalypse
Corporation moved in.

We're alone
in our place now.

They can't
get us here.

We did a good job,
eh, boss?

Not bad. Could have
been a bit more violent.

Can we get
a promotion now, boss?

Huh? Huh? Huh?

Yeah, maybe. Maybe.

In fact, I'm looking for a couple
of executive types

like yourselves

to help turn
the bird sanctuary

into a fluorocarbon plant.

Mom, who are
these people?

Oh, please. This park
is our home.

Can't you please
help the homeless?

Can't you please
lend us a buck?

"Neither a borrower
nor a lender be."

David Mamet.

Masami and I
got our big break

when we were directed
to the Skiji Fish Market.

Well. This is it.

Your father
is here, Melvin.

I know it's hard
to believe.

Here?
In the Fish Market?

Wow!

We were told that my father

worked somewhere
in that neighborhood.

The Skiji Fish Market

was some
big-scale operation.

There were more smelly
dead fish in there

than there were

in the Tromaville
City Council.

The fact that my father
worked with fish

and probably
had to wash his hands

times a day

made me even more
curious about him.

What does
he look like?

Did you find anything else out
about him?

Where is he?

Is he big or small?

No one wants
to talk much

about Mac Junko,

only that he is
called Big Mac.

Big Mac.

My dad Big Mac.

Well, let's find him.

One of the fish cutters

told us that Big Mac
could be found

on the Skutajima
Fishing Bridge

right behind
the Skiji Fish Market,

where the fish boats dock.

This was where
he ran his fish business.

I was going to be
reunited with my father.

I was overcome with Joy.

What a beautiful moment
for a loving son.

( Speaking Japanese )

- Aah!
- Aah!

Melvin.
Look over there.



It's him!
It's really him!

My father, finally!

My search is over.

Oh, he looks
like a Big Teddy Bear.

I love him already!

Dad! It's me, Melvin!

Daddy!

Melvin!

My boy! My son!

Come here.

Suddenly, there he was--
my long-lost father.

This was to be the greatest
moment of my life.

I couldn't wait
to hold him in my arms.

As I joyfully embraced
my long-lost dad,

suddenly my Tromatons went
into a horrendous reaction.

There was evil present,

and horror of horrors,
that evil was my father.

( Speaking Japanese )

Grrr! Grrr!

Cocaine!

He is smuggling
cocaine in fish!

Cocaine!

( Speaking Japanese )

He is smuggling
cocaine in fish!

( Speaking Japanese )

Grr! Grr!

Grr! Grr!
Grr! Grr!

It was at that very moment

that I learned what it was
to plunge

from the heady heights
of ecstasy

to the dismal depths
of despair.

My long-lost dad
was a bum.

Let's get that guy

even if he is my dad.

- Aah!
- Aah!

We followed my father

around the block
to his headquarters

at the Fisherman's Shrine.

I can't believe it!

My own father
smuggling dr*gs!

Oh, it's only a small part
of my business,

only a bit better
than the white-sl*ve trade.

Ha ha ha!

White-sl*ve trade,
too?

Smuggling dr*gs,
with sl*very--

Shut up!

( Bird Tweeting )

You jerk!
You hit Masami!

Are you OK?
Are you all right?

Don't you want to see
my greatest accomplishment?

It was bad enough to discover

that my father
was a drug smuggler,

but even worse, I found out
he smoked cheap, smelly cigers.

This, my boy,
is that we are doing

in a lousy fish market--

collecting fish oils to be used
in the production of...

( Beeping )

Antitromaton.

Grr!

There is enough
anti-tromation in there

to cause a chain reaction

that will actually
change the nucleir

of those toxic particles
of yours,

breaking down the elements
of your body

and turning you
into a harmless puddle of...

Well...

we don't quite know yet...

do we?

But first my boys
want to play with you.

( Speaking Japanese )

Run, Melvin! Run, Melvin!
Run, Melvin!

Don't worry. Don't worry.
I can handle this.

All right. guys!

Banzai!

( Speaking Japanese )

Bonsai.

( Speaking Japanese )

Aah!

( Crash )

Grr!

Grr! Grr!

Aah!

Big Mac!

Where are you?

Grr!

Whoa!

- Grr!
- Ahh!

Grr!

Ahh!

Hehehehe.

- Aha!
- Grr!

- Ahh!
- Grr!

Ahh!

Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!

( Speaking Japanese )

( Music Playing )

Oh, nice.

Grr!

Come on.

Ah, yahh!

Grr!

Aaaaaaaaaah!

Ouch.

- Ahh!
- Grr!

Come here.

- Ahh!
- Grr!

Grr!

Come on, come on.
Let's get out of here.

Oh, No!
It's Kabuki-man!

I'll be right back.

Hey!

En garde!

Heya!

Aah!

Grr! Grr!

Eeyah!

Aah!

Aah! Aah! Aah!

Aah! Aah! Aah!

( Bird Tweeting )

( Speaking Japanese )

Grr!

Melvin, my boy...

I'd like you to meet
one of our accidents.

in developing
anti-tromaton.

He's a handsome fellow,
isn't he, Toxie?

( Squeak! Squeak! )

Sashini anyone?

Grr! Grr! Grr!

Ha ha!

Don't you know
who you're dealing with?

You can't win...

Smelvin!

Smelvin?

Don't call me
Smelvin!

My name is Melvin!
Call me Melvin!

Psychologically,
I felt uncomfortable

about the possibility
of fighting my own father.

I felt even more uncomfortable

when my father suddenly began
taking his clothes off,

then he started
futzing with his hair,

and before I could say
sigmund freud,

my father put on this--
this-- this diaper!

To see my own father
in a diaper...

Whoa! What a Toxic head-trip!

I am the Big Mac.

I am the Big Cheese.

You might say that I am the
Big Mac with cheese.

Heh heh heh!

Grr! Grr!

( Speaking Japanese )

Okey-dokey.

Oh, okey-dokey.

And now...

it's bedtime, Smelvin.

- Aah!
- Aah!

Melvin! Melvin!

Aaah!

Aaah!

Masami knew little
about anti-tromaton

or its deleterious effects on
a hideously deformed creature

of superhuman size
and strength like myself.

But since my condition resulted
from a Sumo Situation,

she wisely took me
to a Sumo Gym,

where I was rehabilitated

thanks to a program of ancient
Sumo Homeopatic Remedies,

Sumo Philosophy,
and Sumo Physical Exercise.

My name is
Shochikuyama.

# ...A wretch like me #

# I once was lost... #

You must first learn
Purifying Ritual.

# I was blind, but now... #

First, we stamp out
the Evil Spirits.

( Fart )

Then we gargle...

the Power Water.

( Slurp )

( Pfftt! )

And scatter...

Purifying salt.

The next step is Nintai--

Patience and tolerance.

If your opponent
is an equal,

you must be sure
to make the first move.

You have served mankind

by k*lling Mac Junko.

We offer you the Mawashi
and Sagari of our Heya.

Oh, domo arigato.

I thank you for your kindness
and your instruction,

and you saved my life.

But I k*lled
my own father,

and I am unworthy.

I will never forget you,

but I must leave now.

Sayonara.

Good-bye, Melvin.

I won't forget you.

Sayonara, Masami.

Kimi no kotowa.

Isho wa suri nai,
Sayonara.

Ah, let's see.

Nintai...

Patience and tolerance.

Make the first move.

Patience and tolerance.

Make the first move.

Back home, the boot-licking
bourgeois bullies

of corporate corruption
had their way

with the little people
of Tromaville.

Apocalypse Incorporated
had little trouble

attaining its goal
of total ownership

of everything and everyone.

Ughh!

Aah!

Mama!

Drop that flowerpot!

Heh heh heh!

You can't take this church,
and you can't take our town!

There are no leverage buyouts
in a house of God!

Aw, are you hungry?
Would you like some french bread?

It's fresh-baked--
Hey! Hey!

Hey! Hey!
Cut it out!

Ow! Ow!
Can you help us?

Aah! Aah! Aah!

Hey, what are you
guys doing?

What do you think
you're doing?

Aah!

Hey!

Oh!

My leg!

Huh?

Ha ha ha!

As I went back home,

I could not
get over the fact

that I had k*lled
my own father!

I felt so guilty,
but I felt a lot worse

when I saw
what Apocalypse Incorporated

had done to Tromaville
in my absence.

( Singing in Foreign Language )

Oops! I almost forgot.

I've got to sort the laundry.

# You're a beast in love #

# And she's your beauty #

Yay!

# You'll see your face #

# A monsterfest #

( Sniff Sniff )

# Toxic bad girls... #

Who's that? Melvin?

Melvin, are you
back from Japan?

Melvin?
Melvin, is that you?

Melvin.
Melvin, is that you?

Back from Japan?

Melvin, your muscles feel--
They feel nice,

but they feel
a little smaller.

Melvin,
what happened to you?

Have you been eating
that funny fish from Japan?

That-- That Sushi?

Melvin, Melvin, why don't you
speak to me?

I missed you so much.

Hey, that's not you,
Melvin!

Have a seat.

We're the new guard,
honey.

You could say we was moving in
on your territory.

This is where she lives?
What a dump.

Absolutely
fascinating.

This place, it needs a lot
of work.

And we're taking over.

I've been waiting
and waiting

to get a hold
of these yellow locks

and these melon-heavy
breasts.

- Woo!
- Woo!

- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

The b*tch
broke my nail!

Let me
k*ll her now, boss.

Melvin!

Melvin.

Melvin.

Grrr.

Whoa! I've got
a Toxic expl*sive for you, baby.

( Laughter )

Melvin!

Grrr!

Grrr!

Aaah!

Grrr!

Bad, bad girl!

Grrr!

Melvin, let's talk
about this.

I've been hurt!
Let's go!

Melvin!

b*tch!

I'm going to break you in half
like a f*cking wishbone.

Get off of me,
you whore!

You crazy b*tch!

You blind bimbo b*tch!

Look, Melvin,
I'm helping.

Melvin.

Claire.

Oh, my Melvin.

Nobody messes
with the bad girls.

Oh, Melvin.

But now Toxie was back home,
and I wasted no time.

I immediately set about
cleaning up Tromaville.

The good citizens rallied
to support me.

Grrr!

Aaah!

Ah.

Yeah!

Grrr!

Grrr!

Grrr!

Grrr!

Grrr!

When the Chairman saw
that I was back

and that his best-laid plans
had gone astray,

he decided that
if he couldn't own Tromaville,

then he was going to
destroy Tromaville.

The evil Chairman Summoned

his craziest
and most violent henchman--

The Dark Rider.

Ah ha ha ha ha ha!

Ah ha ha ha ha!

With pounds
of Nitroglycerin

strapped to his body,

the Dark Rider was ordered

to crash into the Tromaville
City Hall

and blow the entire town
to Smithereens.

If the Dark Rider succeeded
in blowing up Tromaville,

Mom, Claire, and all my friends
would be k*lled.

Even worse,
if Tromaville was destroyed,

there would never be
a Toxic Avenger Part III.

Stop!

Oh!

Hey,
what the--

Sorry about that, Cabby.
I'm the Toxic Avenger.

Ho--ho--holy sh*t.

Now, let's get that guy.

Look out.

Senoir citizens.

Pardon me, ma'am, sir.
I need your cab.

Cabby,
I'm the Toxic Avenger.

We must save Tromaville.

Follow that villain
on the motorcycle

and put the pedal to the metal.
Let's go!

For this
I left the south bronx?

( Speaking Spanish )

I hope I get a good tip
out of this.

Step on it, Cabby.

He went that way.

Hurry up!

Step on it!

Wait!

Ah ah ah!

Whoa!
Step on it, Cabby. Whoa!

Whoa!

I'll fix it later.

Aah!

Herman,
you dumb schmuck.

We should have gone
to the french restaurant.

Shut up, Sadie.
We're going chinese. It's cheaper.

Some wedding
anniversary.

Aah!

Whoa!

OK, kids.
Cross at the green.

Now, kids. Wait.

Hey, what the--

No, no, no!
Slow down.

( Beep! )

No! Slow down!

Well, ha ha ha.

See, Jimmy?
Safety first.

I tell you.

Aaah!

Oh.

Oh, God.

Come on, honey.

year
anniversary.

Some celebration--
with this thing.

My mother shouldn't have made
a contact with you.

You're stupid.

Cut the yapping.
I'm trying to drive.

Let's go!
Get that guy on the bike!

Let's go!

Whoa!

Aah!

Aah!

What the...

Aah!

My car!
What did you do to my car?

Aah!

Aah!

Aaah!

It's all right, Amigo.

You just got yourself
a convertible.

Hey, a convertible.
Customized, too.

Here you go.
try these.

Here.

Get that guy on the bike.
Let's go!

All right!

Aaah!

Aaah!

Stop him!
Aah!

Aaah!

Aah!

Whee! Ah-ha!

Aaah!

Ha ha ha.

# Doo-doo-doo-doo #

# Di-da-da-da #

# Do-da-da-da-da-da-da #

Aiee, ow!
Enough of this Tromaville.

I go back to south bronx,
where it's safe.

Ah, ah, ah, eiee.

Aaah!

Look at that free!

Oh, happy anniversary.
Happy anniversary.

Sadie, we'll go
to the french restaurant.

Oh, Herman,

such an exciting th
wedding anniversary.

Much more so than our honeymoon,
huh?

Oh.

Oy, oy, oy, oy.
I love you.

( Vroom )

Grrr.

Grrr.

Aaah!

( Bell Chimes )

Yay!

All right.

Where am I?
What's going on?

You're in Tromaville,

and the Toxic Avenger
just saved our asses.

So, you're
the Toxic Avenger.

The one and only.

It's hard to believe
you were my little Melvin.

Big Mac!
I don't believe it.

Mildred!

It's a miracle!

I had given up faith that
I would ever find you again.

Dad?

If you're you,
who was that I k*lled in Japan?

A big ugly guy?

He was smuggling cocaine
inside of Tuna Fish.

That's Big Mac Bun, not Junko,
former con man.

I've been mistaken for him
more than once.

He's ruined my credit rating
with visa and mastercard.

I'm glad to know
of his demise.

Well, Dad,
glad to see you.

And who is
this lovely young lady?

Oh, this is
my girl, Claire.

Daddy!

Oh, Big Mac.

I never want you
to wander again--ever.

And I will stay here
with you, my love.

Ahh.

So Mom and Claire
and my real Dad

along with
all the Tromavillians

were once again free
to enjoy life to the fullest,

and the wicked Chairman--

He fled Tromaville as fast as
his evil legs would carry him.

Hey, want a ride?
Big business sucks, you wad.

Now I could really feel good
about myself.

My broken id
was finally repaired

because I knew
that whenever or wherever

the good citizens
of Tromaville needed help,

they could always count on me.

So just remember, folks,

when the bad guys come
to your town,

and you're not quite sure
what to do,

call me,
the Toxic Avenger!
