MAN: Ho, ho!

(MOUSE SQUEAKING)

(SNIFFING)

CLARA: Shh! Fritz. Now, be very still.

This is how we'll do it.

With science, mechanics... and a bit of luck.

First, we've got energy.

The heat from the candle will make the balloon rise.

(CLACKING)

With the momentum from the ball... that hits the monkey... (DINGS)

...and pivots onto the bellows.

(AIR HISSING)

FRITZ: Which blows the longboat.

CLARA: Giving us Newton's third law of physics... that says every action has an equal... and opposite...? Reaction.

Yes! (LAUGHING) FRITZ: Yes!

(MOUSE SNIFFING) Do they bite?

I suppose they do.

If you're horrid to them.

(MOUSE SQUEAKS)

Oh, there you are.

Up and down I've been looking for you rascals.

Worn out, I am.

FRITZ: We were catching a mouse.

Well, if you catch one, I'm not cooking it.

Too many bones.

Now, come on, be quick.

We have a lot to do before this evening.

LOUISE: There you are!

I've been looking all over for you.

Look at the state of you.

We were trying to catch a mouse... with toys and momentum and matches and...

Matches?

It was Clara's idea. (SCOFFS)

LOUISE: Catching mice on Christmas Eve?

Honestly, Clara.

We nearly had him.

What were you gonna do with him when you caught him?

FRITZ: Teach him tricks. He could dance.

Ah. There you are. What do we think?

It's wonderful, Father.

With a few adjustments, perhaps.

It's not how Mother did it.

(QUIETLY) Fritz.

Um... Now, children, I have some presents for you.

But it's not Christmas Day.

They're from your mother.

She asked me to give them to you on Christmas Eve.

That one's for you.

(CHUCKLES)

Louise. Thank you.

FRITZ: Soldiers! Yay!

BENJAMIN: Clara.

FRITZ: The enemy has found our location!

(IMITATING g*nf*re)

We've been ambushed!

They're from both sides!

(GASPS) It's Mother's favorite.

Yes. Yes, it was.

What is it, Clara?

It's an egg of some sort.

What's inside? Is it jewelry?

I don't know.

It's locked.

Are you sure it opens?

There's a keyhole. Here.

But there's no key.

Why would Mother give me this without a key?

It's just a silly egg that doesn't open.

It's not just a silly egg, Fritz.

Clara.

Clara!

CLARA: "Everything you need is inside."

BENJAMIN: Clara.

Is everything all right?

No.

This is a pin tumbler lock.

It's impossible to open without a key.

I see.

Well, why don't you get ready for the party, and then you can work it out tomorrow.

Clara, Christmas comes... whether we like it or not.

We must do our best to enjoy it.

I don't want to enjoy it.

I don't want to enjoy anything right now.

Well, that may be the case... but it's important to maintain traditions as a family.

It's what's expected of us.

I don't care what's expected.

Well, you should. LOUISE: Father?

It's almost time to go.

Do I look all right?

Yes.

Yes, indeed.

Please get your sister ready.

LOUISE: You must be gentle with him, Clara.

I wish Mother was here.

We all do.

I have to open this.

LOUISE: You'll work it out.

You're an extremely clever girl, just like Mother.

I don't feel very clever lately.

Maybe you should spend a little less time in the attic... and a little more time in the real world.

The real world just doesn't make sense to me anymore.

You must try, Clara.

If only for Father.

Father is acting as if nothing has changed.

But everything has changed.

"D." It's Drosselmeyer.

He must have made this.

And maybe he can open it!

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Good.

Now, will you let me finish with your hair?

Yes. But please hurry.

(LOUISE CHUCKLES)

BENJAMIN: It is important to be on your best behavior tonight.

That means remembering our manners at dinner. Fritz!

I do want one dance with you, Louise.

And you, Clara.

Do I have to dance? BENJAMIN: Yes, you do.

And no disappearing tonight either.

Mingle and engage with the guests.

What about me?

What about you?

Who will dance with me?

(MECHANICAL WHIRRING)

FRITZ: Yay! Godfather's house.

Last one in is a nincompoop.

(LIVELY CHATTER)

BUTLER: Master Drosselmeyer welcomes Mr. and Mrs. Jeremiah Jones.

Doctor and Mrs. McDonald, Timothy and Ezekiel McDonald.

FRITZ: Magic!

CLARA: Fritz, come on.

FRITZ: How do we get them back?

BENJAMIN: The Stahlbaum family.

Benjamin, Louise, Fritz, and Clara.

(WALTZ MUSIC PLAYING)

Godfather?

(OWL SCREECHES) (GASPS)

Hello.

(HOOTING SOFTLY)

Have you seen Godfather anywhere?

DROSSELMEYER: He sees everything.

Which can be a great help to an old man.

(CHUCKLING) Godfather.

Hello, Clara.

I need your help.

Ah. But I need your help first.

Look at this damn thing.

(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

(CLANKING) Backwards.

It moves... backwards.

The mechanism must be reversed.

I know, but I can't, for the life of me, figure out why.

May I?

Please.

(SWITCH CLICKS) (MUSIC STOPS)

It looks like the idler wheel has slipped.

Hmm.

Causing the pinion ring to engage the secondary drive gear.

Pliers.

Ah.

There.

(SWITCH CLICKS) (MUSIC RESUMES)

Ah.

Clever girl. (CHUCKLES)

I knew you could do it.

All right now, Miss Clara... (SWITCH CLICKS)

Why are you down here with me instead of upstairs, dancing?

I need your help with something.

With this.

Ah.

I haven't seen this in a very long time.

I made it for another clever girl... who came to live with me after she was orphaned at a very early age.

Mother. Mmm-hmm.

You know, when she first arrived... she wouldn't leave her room.

Spent day and night locked away... her head buried in her books.

So, what did you do?

I left this outside her door.

And, over time, she came to trust me... but most importantly... herself.

And now she's given it to you.

But she didn't leave me the key.

You must miss her terribly.

I know I do.

And I can't imagine how your father must feel.

All Father cares about is appearances.

No.

My guess is he feels every bit the way you do.

Remember, Clara, some locks are harder to pick than others.

And I'm afraid this one is especially tricky.

Pin tumblers.

I know.

I tried. (CHUCKLES)

(BELL TOLLS) Oh.

It's time.

Here, you run along and I'll be up shortly.

It's Christmas Eve.

It's going to be a magical night.

(FOOTSTEPS RECEDING)

(OWL CHIRPS)

Yes, I know, my friend.

It won't be easy.

But it was her mother's dying wish... so go keep an eye on her.

(INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)

(MUSIC ENDS) (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

Ladies and gentlemen... my favorite part of Christmas... my favorite part of this evening...

I present to you... your gifts.

(EXCITED CHATTER)

(CHILDREN GIGGLE)

(CHATTER CONTINUES)

"Fritz." (LAUGHS)

BENJAMIN: Clara.

Where have you been?

I've been looking everywhere for you.

I was in Drosselmeyer's workshop trying to open...

I told you not to disappear.

And I was expecting to dance with you.

Father, I really don't want to dance.

Why, Clara, must you think only about yourself?

I could ask the same of you.

GIRL: Come look! Come over here!

Come look! BOY: I need to go.

No, this way. GIRL 2: Okay.

(CHILDREN CHATTERING)

GIRL 3: I found mine.

(CHATTER CONTINUES)

FRITZ: Look at my present.

(GROWLS) (GASPS)

(SQUEAKS)

A nutcracker soldier.

SOLDIER: Halt!

Who goes there?

It's just me! State your purpose, Just Me.

No, my name is Clara, and I must cross this bridge.

Impossible.

Nobody crosses the bridge to the Fourth Realm... without a direct order from the regents.

Fourth Realm?

Where am I?

You're in the Christmas Tree Forest.

But that is the Fourth Realm... which is currently at w*r with the other three realms.

w*r?

That is correct, Miss Clara Just Me.

No. My name isn't Clara Just Me.

It's Stahlbaum.

(CLATTERS) Clara Stahlbaum.

Stahlbaum?

Are you a relation to Marie Stahlbaum?

She's my mother.

Forgive me, Your Majesty!

I didn't recognize you, Princess Clara.

Princess?

Captain Phillip Hoffman.

At your service, Your Majesty.

(QUIETLY) Maybe I have been spending too much time in the attic.

Captain Hoffman, I'd like to cross the river.

But the Fourth Realm is a very...

I have to go, Captain Hoffman.

Is that an order, Princess Clara?

Yes. I suppose it is.

And you can call me Clara.

Is that an order, too?

Yes.

Very well. Call me Captain.

CLARA: Guess I'm not in London anymore.

PHILLIP: London? What's London?

CLARA: It's where I'm from.

PHILLIP: Clara? What are we looking for?

A gold key.

It must be important, this key.

(BIRD SQUAWKING) It is. Very.

Are you scared, Captain?

Me? Never.

(JINGLES SNORTS)

CLARA: Are you out here all by yourself, Captain?

PHILLIP: Of course.

I'm the only nutcracker in the entire kingdom.

Don't you get lonely? Lonely?

No. I know my place.

That's good enough for me.

You're lucky.

I wish I knew mine.

(MICE SQUEAKING)

PHILLIP: But you're the daughter of the queen.

Surely you know your place.

CLARA: I'm afraid not.

That's why I have to find that key.

PHILLIP: Then we shall do exactly that.

(MOUSE SQUEAKS) Stop!

There he is!

Mouserinks!

Ah! That diabolical little rodent.

We need to approach with extreme caution!

(JINGLES NEIGHING)

Coward!

Clara, wait!

(SQUEAKING)

Give me my key back... you horrid little mouse!

That key belongs to me!

Come on out of there!

Come on!

(LOUD SQUEAKING) (SCREAMING)

Clara!

(SCREAMING)

CLARA: Let me go!

Put me down!

(SQUEAKING) Put me down!

Captain!

Captain, help me!

Captain!

PHILLIP: Run!

What is that thing? It's the Mouse King.

Don't look back. Just keep running.

(LOUD SQUEAKING)

(MOUSERINKS SQUEAKING)

I think we've lost him.

(BRANCH SNAPS) Show yourself!

Oh. Jingles. (JINGLES NEIGHS)

Jingles, good boy.

Clara, we need to go.

Not without my key. But...

Who's intruding in my realm?

Okay. Maybe going is a good idea.

Is that you, Clara Stahlbaum? (ECHOING)

Why are you here?

I have your key.

It's a trap. If you go... you'll never come back. No one ever does.

Clara!

Come here and get your key!

Clara!

What was that?

That was Mother Ginger.

And she doesn't like intruders.

(SWEEPING MUSIC PLAYING)

CAVALIER: Halt.

I need to get to the palace.

I'm sure you do, sunshine.

But we have procedures around here.

Protocols.

I'm Captain Phillip Hoffman and I demand you let us through.

Oh! "Demand," is it now? "Demand," oh.

Captain Hoffman of the famous Hoffmans, is it?

Well, if we'd known you were coming, we would have rolled out the red carpet... booked the trumpeteers. Captain Hoffman has arrived.

For goodness' sake, she's a princess.

HARLEQUIN: Well, they all say that these days.

Wishing don't make it so, my love.

Overindulgent fathers, that's what I put it down to.

Would it help if I told you that her name was Clara Stahlbaum?

Daughter of Marie Stahlbaum?

(STAMMERS)

All right, just a few questions, Your Highness, and you'll be on your way.

This is ridiculous.

Have you had any contact with mice or mouse-like entities recently?

I was in the Fourth Realm. Thank you.

Do you have any cheese or cheese-based products on or about your person?

CLARA: I... Thank you.

How would you describe your sympathies towards rodents in general?

Well... Thank you. Good, right.

Well, that is the survey complete.

There's no ink coming out your pen.

You may pass, please. (CLEARS THROAT)

Attention! Lower the bridge!

Thank you.

HARLEQUIN: Lower the drawbridge!

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

WOMAN: Is that Marie's daughter?

MAN 1: She's so beautiful.

MAN 2: Make way for the princess.

(TRUMPETS PLAYING FANFARE)

Mother.

Your Excellencies... may I present Miss Clara Stahlbaum.

(GASPS AND STAMMERS)

Is it true? It is true.

I'm Hawthorne...

Regent of the Land of Flowers... at your most humble service.

I am Shiver...

Regent of the Land of Snowflakes, ma'am.

An honor.

And the Regent of the Land of Sweets...

Sugar Plum.

SUGAR PLUM: I never thought this day would come.

Oh, tell us, we long for news.

How is our queen, dear Marie?

My mother? We miss her so.

You don't know?

My mother, she's...

She died.

(ALL GASP)

Marie, dead?

We are so sorry for your loss.

To leave life so young...

She was the most beautiful, wonderful...

She meant everything to us.

Everything.

SHIVER: This is your mother's throne...

Your Grace.

SUGAR PLUM: Have you come to save us, Clara?

No.

(SUGAR PLUM GASPS)

I'm sorry.

I didn't even know this place existed before today.

You see, I was looking for a Christmas present from my godfather.

I love Christmas!

What's Christmas?

And then I ran into this horrible little mouse.

(WHISPERS) Mouse?

And that's when I met the captain.

We barely escaped Mother Ginger and the Mouse King.

(GASPS) You met Mother Ginger?

Oh, my dear Clara... you're lucky to be alive.

You must promise never to go back to the Land of Amusements, Clara!

Oh! Hawthorne!

Its title has been rescinded, Hawthorne!

Oh! (STAMMERS) Of course. I meant the Fourth Realm.

Apologies.

I'm just so upset.

Forget I ever mentioned the Land of...

Oh!

Oh.

HAWTHORNE: It's pure fortune you got out alive.

No one ever escapes from the Fourth Realm.

SHIVER: Hawthorne is right.

We can't risk losing our princess when she's only just arrived.

CLARA: But... And talking of arriving... we need to organize a pageant to celebrate your coming.

Oh! And a tour of the realms.

Oh, this is so exciting!

I love a pageant!

That sounds lovely... but I have to get back to Drosselmeyer's party.

(ALL LAUGHING)

She doesn't know.

Time is very different in the realms.

Very.

SUGAR PLUM: Come.

I'll show you.

Princess Clara, I'll be returning to my post now.

You are not leaving me.

That's an order.

Sugar Plum... who's Mother Ginger?

SUGAR PLUM: Well, she used to be a regent.

Just like me and Hawthorne and Shiver.

She was the Regent of the Land of...

(WHISPERS) Amusements.

(NORMAL VOICE) But now... she is banished.

Why was she... banished?

We had no choice, Clara.

She tried to take control of the other realms... by force.

But when her evil intentions became clear... even her own people deserted her.

And her realm... fell to ruin.

That's so tragic.

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

(GASPS) But things are looking up now that you're here, dear Clara.

Come! It's time to put your mind at ease.

(MECHANICAL WHIRRING)

See anything familiar?

CLARA: It looks like the clock in Godfather's ballroom.

But that's impossible.

Is it?

Stand very still.

(TICKING)

I'm back.

Everything seems to be going so slowly.

How is this possible?

Your world moves much more slowly than our world.

Fritz and Louise.

There they are.

And look, there's Father.

He looks... lost.

Everything looks different from the realms.

(CLOCK CHIMING)

Voila.

For the pageant.

Which one will you choose?

I'm not very good at dresses and hair, shoes...

If I may be so bold as to suggest that I help?

Would you? It's my favorite thing!

(GASPS) Oh, we will not disappoint them.

You will look magnificent.

Did my mother ever talk about me?

Oh, yes. All the time.

Sometimes it seemed as if you were right here with us.

Now, close your eyes.

Close your eyes.

Now, open your eyes.

Do you like it?

I love it.

I look so different.

SUGAR PLUM: You look like the daughter of a queen.

(PLAYING FANFARE)

Ladies and gentlemen, on this momentous day... in the history of the Four Realms...

We are proud and privileged to present before you...

Clara Stahlbaum, daughter of Queen Marie.

(ALL APPLAUDING)

They're all staring at me, Sugar Plum.

Of course.

You're every inch your mother's daughter.

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

(CLEARS THROAT)

(SIGHS)

(ORCHESTRA PLAYING)

The ballet tells the story of the Four Realms... how your mother discovered our world.

First, the Land of Flowers.

SUGAR PLUM: Now... the Land of Snowflakes.

And the Land of Sweets.

(INAUDIBLE CONVERSATIONS)

(BELLS JINGLING)

Mice?

SUGAR PLUM: Now we're in the Fourth Realm.

Watch closely, Clara.

This is where our troubles began.

With Mother Ginger and the mice?

Beastly woman.

There's nothing motherly about her.

(KEYS WHIRRING)

Mother Ginger's the one who began this w*r.

I hope you'll be the one to finish it.

What do you mean?

(ORCHESTRA STOPS PLAYING) (ALL APPLAUDING)

Come, I'll show you.

Dear Queen Marie kept Mother Ginger in line... but now that she's gone, we're utterly defenseless.

I don't understand.

You see, once we were lifeless toys... mere playthings for children.

Then your mother arrived and changed everything.

She gave us life.

How?

With this.

The Engine.

CLARA: This is my mother's invention?

SUGAR PLUM: Yes. The Engine made us real.

And now we have feelings just like you have.

Happiness, sadness, anger, love.

Fear.

There's plenty of that going around.

You're right, sweet captain.

Our spies tell us that Mother Ginger is on the warpath... gathering all her forces.

The Engine is the only way that we can build an army to defend ourselves.

But it doesn't work.

If we can't get it to work again, then all is lost.

Perhaps I could fix it.

It's not broken.

We're simply missing the key.

Key? The key.

We've searched hither and yon throughout the kingdom.

(KEYS CLATTERING)

I fear your dear mother must have taken it with her.

But she never returned.

A pin tumbler.

Sugar Plum, look.

This was a present from my mother.

The locks match.

It must be the same key.

This key of which you speak... where is it?

That horrible little mouse took it.

PHILLIP: Mouserinks!

He's diabolical.

But that means that Mother Ginger has it.

Oh, pooh!

Then we can't make the army... and we'll be annihilated.

Unless we can bring the key back.

Get it back?

I could go to the Fourth Realm.

Oh, no! It's too, too dangerous!

I came here to find that key.

Clara, you're not going back there.

This must be why my mother sent me here.

I can't let Mother Ginger destroy everything she created.

We were lucky to escape with our lives the last time.

Mother Ginger's more dangerous than you know.

I must get that key.

MARIE: You found him.

He's your favorite, isn't he?

Well, we can't have Christmas without the nutcracker.

I found him at Drosselmeyer's.

He reminds me of a land I discovered when I was a little girl... full of sweets and flowers and the funniest people.

That sounds wonderful.

It was.

Maybe you'll go there too one day.

Maybe you can take me there.

Are you all right, Mother?

I'm fine.

I'd love to take you, my darling.

But there are some journeys... you have to go on alone.

Clara, I know you sometimes wish you were more like your sister.

But I love you because you're so different.

You see the world in a unique way.

When you realize that's your greatest strength... you can change the world, my girl.

And I'll be watching you.

Now, where are you going to put him?

It's perfect.

(CLOCK TICKING)

(TAPPING)

(OWL HOOTS)

CLARA: Oh, Mother, it's so beautiful here.

I don't know if I can get the key back.

And if I fail... this whole world you discovered...

I wish you were here.

So you can tell me that I'm doing the right thing like you used to.

(WIND BLOWING)

(OWL HOOTS)

No.

"Everything you need is inside."

There's nothing here.

There's music.

I thought... (MUSIC STOPS)

I thought if I found this key... then I would find answers... that everything would make sense.

I'm just as lost as when I arrived here.

Here... take the key.

Bring it to Sugar Plum.

Where are you going?

Home. Home?

But, Clara, we need you here.

No.

Captain, you need my mother.

She was a queen... and I'm not.

I've never left my post, you know.

I knew my place.

And I was happy.

But when you told me you were going into the Fourth Realm...

I knew I'd go with you.

And it wasn't because you're Marie's daughter... but because you have her same look... of confidence... and determination.

I don't feel very confident right now.

You just led a regiment of men into the Fourth Realm... and took back this key from Mother Ginger.

You're not lost, Clara Stahlbaum.

Your place is here. (OWL SCREECHES)

(SQUEALS) You clever girl! Down, quick!

Quickly!

Finally!

How long I've waited for this moment!

(CLICKS)

(WHIRRING)

(SQUEALS) Wonderful!

Bring me the tin soldiers.

(RATTLING)

You can't use tin soldiers.

Well, of course I can. Don't be silly.

You have no idea how they'll behave.

They're completely hollow.

They'll behave exactly as I tell them to.

The perfect soldier.


Put them on the platform.

It is time to think big.

Are you sure about this?

She has to protect the realms.

(SPEAKS FRENCH)

(CLATTERS)

Ready, steady, go! (GASPS)

(WHIRRING)

(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

(RATTLING)

(METAL CREAKING)

Hello, boys!

They're huge!

I know. Isn't it magnificent?

Soldiers... attention!

Report!

(CLANGING)

Prepare to march on the Fourth Realm.

March on the...

I thought this army was to defend us.

Well, attack is the best form of defense, my dear.

My mother wouldn't have wanted this.

I don't care what your mother wanted.

She's not here.

I...

I order you to stop.

You order me?

Well, well, well.

Finally ready to play queen, are we?

Too late.

I only needed you to bring me the key, and now that I have it...

I have no more use for you.

Seize them!

Take your hands off her!

SUGAR PLUM: Oh, they won't listen to you.

I gave them life... so they'll only listen to me.

Traitor!

Why are you doing this?

Your mother abandoned us.

And then... she just expects us to carry on and play nice.

Well, I don't want to play nice!

Mother Ginger didn't do anything wrong, did she?

You lied to me.

To everyone.

But I have a very special plan for Mother Ginger... and the other regents.

Watch.

Oh, Guard... will you stand over there, please?

Yes, just right in the center.

(LEVER CLICKS)

(ELECTRICITY CRACKLES)

SUGAR PLUM: You see... there's a funny little perk... to your mother's invention.

It works both ways.

You are horrible.

How dare you speak to your queen that way!

Guards!

Lock them up.

There's no way to escape.

HAWTHORNE: Get your hands off of me! Don't touch me!

SHIVER: Hands off! HAWTHORNE: How dare you!

SHIVER: I've never been treated like this... in all my life.

Get off! Oh, my God!

(GASPING) Alas... you're here as well, my dear.

What's happening?

What's Sugar Plum doing?

Why are we locked up here?

It's all my fault.

I've let you all down.

No. No.

Clara, that's not true.

Sugar Plum lied to us.

But I gave her the key... and now she's going to use it to destroy the realms... and everything that my mother loved.

Clara, listen to me. No!

I wanted to go home... but you stopped me... and now I've ruined everything.

(CLANGING)

This is more like it.

A proper army.

To create discipline... order, control.

Boys in uniform with weapons.

Sends a quiver right through me.

(EXHALES)

(MUSIC PLAYING ON MUSIC BOX)

"Everything you need is inside."

It's me.

(MUSIC STOPS) Captain.

I'm sorry for blaming you.

This is all my fault, and I'm going to fix it.

Will you help me?

(SIGHS)

Please?

Of course I will.

Nutcrackers are very loyal.

You are indeed.

Are you ready?

Ready.

Go!

(GRUNTING)

(BOTH GASP)

I'm sorry.

CLARA: A little more.

A bit more.

SHIVER: My dear, that doesn't look very secure.

HAWTHORNE: You can't.

It's not gonna work.

It's just the laws of physics.

Do those laws always work?

Always.

(QUIETLY) As far as I know.

Ready.

Ready.

(WHIMPERS)

Go!

SHIVER: Whoa! (GASPS)

Clara.

SUGAR PLUM: That's more like it.

There she is.

SUGAR PLUM: Out with the old... in with the new.

Gather at the gate. (DRUMS BEATING)

Wait for my command.

Jog on, boys.

She's going.

I have to get to the Engine Room and stop this.

(CLANGING)

We can't get in this way.

(SQUEAKS)

Mouserinks.

Get out of here! Wait!

I think he's trying to tell us something.

(SQUEAKS)

Quickly.

(SQUEAKS)

(GRUNTS) (WATER SPLASHES)

CLARA: Thank you for your help.

(SQUEAKS)

Can you get us to the Engine Room?

Are you sure we can trust him?

(SQUEAKING)

Don't start with me, mouse!

All right, stop!

We don't have much time.

We need to work together.

(SQUEAKS)

Show us.

Where'd he go?

This way!

We should be able to ride the wheels up to the Engine Room.

All right...

I'll go first. No!

You have to warn Mother Ginger.

Those soldiers will be heading to the Fourth Realm.

What? I'm not going to leave you, Clara.

I can handle this.

You have to trust me. Please.

I do.

Can you take the captain to Mother Ginger?

(SQUEAKS)

Thank you.

(SQUEAKS)

Be careful.

That's an order, Captain.

(SQUEAKS)

(CLARA YELPS)

Thank you, Captain.

Please, Clara, call me Phillip.

Thank you, Phillip.

Let's go, mouse.

Lead the way.

(SQUEAKING)

I don't speak rodent.

(SQUEAKS)

(SIGHS)

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

(CROWS CAWING) (GASPS)

Mother Ginger!

POLICHINELLE: Oh.

(BELLS JINGLING)

Wait!

I come as a friend.

Look.

(SQUEAKS)

MOTHER GINGER: Let him through!

(BELLS JINGLE)

Where's Clara? PHILLIP: In the palace.

But she has a plan. Please, Mother Ginger.

Sugar Plum has built an army to conquer all the realms.

They're coming for you.

Sugar Plum thinks she's divided us all.

But a long time ago we both took an oath to our queen... to defend the realms no matter the cost.

(SQUEAKS)

Are you still willing to uphold that oath?

No matter the cost, I'm ready.

Brave nutcracker.

So now... we must draw Sugar Plum to us.

(SQUEAKING)

(METALLIC WHIRRING)

(CLANGING)

(WHIRRING)

(ELECTRICITY CRACKLES)

(BELLS JINGLING)

(POLICHINELLE SQUEAKING)

(POLICHINELLES WHOOPING, SQUEALING)

Forget those ludicrous clowns!

I want Mother Ginger!

(SQUEAKING)

(SWORDS CLANGING)

(CLANKING)

(TOY MOUSE SQUEAKING) (SWORDS CLANGING)

(CLATTERS)

(GASPS)

SUGAR PLUM: Victory is ours!

Come out, Mother Ginger!

(DOOR CLANGS, OPENS)

(COUGHING)

The nutcracker?

Were you expecting someone else?

Where is she?

(CLANGING)

(BELLS JINGLING) Oh! (GROANS)

Mother Ginger!

At your service, Your Majesty!

Duck!

Destroy him!

You heard her. Come and get me.

I can disable the Engine.

Go! I'll take care of this lot.

(WHIP CRACKING)

(GRUNTS)

(CLANGING)

No matter the cost. I'm ready.

(MICE SQUEAKING)

Mouserinks.

(SQUEAKING)

Come on, you tin cans.

Let's settle this like men.

(WHIP CRACKING)

MOTHER GINGER: Clara! Please, hurry!

(PHILLIP GRUNTS)

(MOUSE KING SQUEAKING)

(GRUNTS)

Mother Ginger, I'm just so pleased... you decided to drop in. (YELLS)

(GRUNTING)

Mouserinks... don't let them split us up.

Stay with me.

(MOUSERINKS SQUEAKING) (CLANGING)

(CLANKING)

You just had to interfere again, didn't you?

I stopped you once before, remember?

You merely delayed the inevitable.

(LOCK CLICKS)

The princess... where is she?

She's gone!

She's fled the realm. She's safe from you!

Then I'm the queen of the castle... and you're a dirty rascal.

This is madness, Sugar Plum! It has to stop!

Put her on the platform.

MOTHER GINGER: Sugar Plum...

I know you miss Marie.

We all do.

But this isn't gonna make you feel any better!

SUGAR PLUM: Banishing you to the Fourth Realm... made me feel just... delicious.

But this...

(WHIRRING) this is going to be... exquisite.

Adieu.

Farewell.

Goodbye.

Sugar Plum, stop!

Clara, run! Get out of here!

Seize her!

For the princess, my friend... and the realms.

(MOUSE KING SQUEAKING)

Don't do this.

My mother loved you.

You had a special place in her heart.

You, of all people, should understand, Clara.

She left you alone, too.

CLARA: No.

She left me everything I need.

I'm not alone.

Sugar Plum, we are not alone.

You're right.

I have a big, beautiful army to protect me.

No one will hurt me ever again.

CLARA: I know you're angry.

But you can still do the right thing.

MOTHER GINGER: Sugar Plum, listen to her.

This isn't what Marie wanted for us.

For us?

A true queen does what's best for herself.

(WHIRRING)

(EXHALES)

CLARA: No.

A true queen does what's best for her people.

(SWORDS CLANG) (PHILLIP GRUNTS)

CLARA: And you were right, Sugar Plum.

I am every inch my mother's daughter.

(WHIRRING)

Clara, what have you done?

(SCREAMING)

(ELECTRICITY CRACKLES)

(CLATTERS)

(GASPS)

(CLANGING)

She did it.

Let me go.

(CLANGING)

(MICE SQUEAKING)

Mouserinks.

Clara did it.

(MICE SQUEAKING CHEERFULLY)

Mother Ginger?

Well done, Clara.

(SWEEPING MUSIC PLAYING)

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

Clara, it's over. We are saved.

Peace is restored. The realms are reunited.

And it's all because of you, my dear.

This all could have been avoided if only I listened to you, Mother Ginger.

MOTHER GINGER: Oh, it's not your fault.

No one else did either.

Your mother would be very proud of you, my dear.

Very proud.

Captain Nutcracker, would you escort Clara to the Christmas Tree Forest... and then return in your new post as Captain of the Guard.

What about your bridge?

I'm afraid I'd be lonely.

I suppose I have you to thank for that.

I suppose you do.

And besides, I have a new friend now.

(SQUEAKS)

(FANFARE PLAYING)

(CROWD CHEERING)

Your Majesty.

Your Highness. And brave Captain Nutcracker.

It is an honor to serve at your post, sir.

Keep up the good work, men.

On three. One, two, three.

(BOTH GRUNTING) (WOOD CREAKS)

(BOTH EXHALE)

You've really put on weight.

(SNIFFLES)

(SNEEZES)

(JINGLES NEIGHS)

Please come back to the realms one day.

Oh, of course I will.

Or maybe one day, you could come to my world.

You can meet my family.

Are they like you?

(CHUCKLES)

Well, they're a bit different.

I'm going to miss you.

I'll miss you too.

But when you miss someone, you remember them.

Are you sure?

And one day that'll make you smile.

I promise you.

Goodbye, Clara.

Goodbye.

(JINGLES SNORTS)

Clara?

There you are.

Back so soon?

Thank you.

DROSSELMEYER: Ah. (CHUCKLES)

Pin tumbler locks.

Devilish things to get into, aren't they?

I worked it out. Eventually.

Hmm. I knew you would.

Clara... your mother was the cleverest inventor I ever knew.

And there was never any doubt when I asked what her greatest creation was.

It was you.

Clara.

Father, I'm so sorry.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

This time has been extremely difficult... for all of us.

I lost the love of my life, and you lost your mother.

And I will miss her every day of my life.

But I don't want to miss one more minute... with you, or Louise, or Fritz.

(SWEEPING MUSIC PLAYING)

Shall we go home?

Don't you owe me a dance first?

After all, it's what's expected of us.

I suppose I do.

(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) Ah, you've opened it.

Wasn't so hard after all.

What is it?

This is the very song that your mother and I first danced to.

LOUISE: May we join you?

I want to dance.

Please do.
