Casual Sex? 
Feelin' hot, hot, hot 
You gotta 
be kidding. 
I can't 
deal with it. 
Me neither. 
Not anymore. 
Just the thought of it 
makes me paranoid. 
We should introduce ourselves. I'm Stacy. 
I'm Melissa. 
And right now we're both 
scared of being single 
and having sex. 
I've always been 
scared of sex. 
Not me. 
This is kind of embarrassing 
to admit, but I remember when 
it was actually fun to say, 
"Wow, that really felt great. 
What's your name again?" 
I've never had 
sex with someone 
I didn't know. 
For that matter I've never 
said, "Wow, that felt 
really great." 
Sex always seemed like 
the best way to feel 
really connected with guys. 
I guess that's cause 
I grew up when I did. 
I wasn't much of a trendsetter during the sexual revolution. 
It would have been a lot easier if I would have been 
more like Stacy. 
Melissa, 
you'll never guess what. 
What? 
Page 3/65
Last night Kenny Kreiger 
came over to 
where I was babysitting. 
- And guess what. 
- What? 
We were fooling around 
and guess what happened. 
What? 
He made me touch it! 
[ Both Squeal ] 
It was so weird. 
It was like skin, 
only different. 
What color was it? 
I don't know. 
I didn't look at it. 
I just touched it. 
You never saw it? 
Well, I don't know. 
It felt like... orange? 
[ Both Squeal ] 
By senior year, I saw it. 
But I still couldn't 
tell you what color it was. 
A month after my 17th birthday, I finally did it... 
with it. 
Is that it? Did we do it? 
[ Boy ] 
Yeah. 
It kinda hurt, 
but it was good. 
Yeah. Did you see 
my other shoe anywhere? 
By my second year of college, 
I knew I couldn't put it off 
any longer. 
I was the only virgin 
left in the dorm... 
except Ronny, 
who knew even less 
about sex than I did. 
[ Exhales ] 
Please, Ronny. 
Page 4/65
You're my best male friend, 
and the first time I do it... 
I want it to be with someone 
I'm comfortable with. 
[ Sighs ] 
Well-- Okay. 
But let's not get 
all freaked out afterwards. 
Thanks. I really 
appreciate it. 
[ Sighs ] 
[ Flips Pages ] 
I guess I should 
undress now? 
That would be good. 
You want foreplay? 
Yeah, that... 
would be good. 
[ Stacy ] I was especially hot for struggling artistic types 
with a lot of potential, 
like Baylor Schneff, 
neo-post-pop expressionist. 
His lovemaking 
was just like his art. 
Primitive but passionate. 
[ No Audio ] 
Brian Ellis, lead guitarist 
for Dripping Sweat. 
I couldn't get enough 
of those backstage passes. 
Gunter Kroger, 
the sous-chef that trained me-- He taught me to 
trust my instincts 
in the kitchen. 
[ Laughs ] 
Stop! I can't-- 
Joey Egan, the closing act 
at the Giggle Box-- 
His timing was even better 
horizontally. 
[ Laughs ] 
But not every man in my life 
Page 5/65
was an artistic genius. 
Some I must admit 
were very attractive strangers. It was the early '80s, 
and sex was still a good way 
to meet new people. 
[ Man ] 
Uh, excuse me. 
[ Melissa Narrating ] 
I was never as adventurous 
as Stacy. 
Apart from that time 
with Ronny, I only slept 
with one other person. 
Gary Erdman, 
the guy I almost married. 
[ TV Announcer ] 
Three-pointer! 
[ Melissa Narrating ] 
I teach kindergarten, 
and one of my kids fixed us up. Well, actually 
it was Joey's mom, 
but Joey took the credit. 
[ Urinating ] 
God, I love the idea 
of being married, 
of not being by myself. 
[ Toilet Flushes ] 
Now with Gary, I thought 
I was finally comfortable 
with my own sexuality. 
[ TV Announcer ] 
No call. To Bird. 
Inside. Off the glass. 
[ Melissa Narrating ] 
But deep down, I guess I knew 
it wasn't gonna work. 
Okay, so I didn't know, 
but I had a feeling. 
Gary? 
Mm-hmm. 
Do you love me? 
Sure. 
Page 6/65
I love ya. 
Unbelievable! The Celtics 
always get the breaks. 
[ Sighs ] 
Two weeks before the wedding, 
Gary changed his mind. 
He said he was sorry, 
but he was going through 
a selfish phase. 
Luckily, the tags 
were still on my dress, 
but I couldn't return 
the 600 monogrammed napkins. 
Just once I'd like to wear 
a sexy white dress 
blowing all around me... 
and not have men 
run away screaming. 
Just once I'd like to have 
the kind of sexual experience... where you don't have 
to go to the bathroom 
and cry afterwards. 
I bet Marilyn cried 
in the bathroom after sex. 
Probably more than once. 
Everyone does. 
Men too? 
They can't. 
They're asleep. 
Maybe Melissa envied 
my reckless past, 
but some time 
around the mid-'80s 
I started regretting it. 
One day I was standing in line at the mini-mart, and I happened to look at the magazine rack. 
Time, Newsweek, People. 
It was on every cover. 
So, Stacy. 
How are things 
at the restaurant? 
Oh, fine. 
Page 7/65
Yeah, when are they 
gonna make you a chef? 
Soon. Do you have my results? 
Yeah, don't worry. 
You're fine. 
You tested for everything? 
Yeah, I tested 
for everything, okay? 
And you're 
perfectly healthy. 
Are you sure? 
I'm sure. 
Good-bye, Stacy. 
Oh, thank you, thank you, 
thank you for sparing 
a formerly flirtatious, 
spontaneous, and let's face it, much too promiscuous slamhound. You won't be sorry, 
'cause from now on I swear I'll lead a life of pure sublimation. I'll aerobicize 
my little heart out. 
I'll meditate. 
I'll compose symphonies. 
I'll do anything 
to keep myself from ever 
touching human flesh again. 
I'll give new meaning 
to the word "celibacy." 
Ooh! 
Stacy, you don't 
have to commit to 
lifelong celibacy. 
Just practice safe sex. 
Safe sex. Who'd have ever 
thought those two words would 
exist in the same sentence? 
I don't know. 
Maybe abstinence 
isn't such a bad thing. 
Beats sleepin' with guys 
who don't call you back 
afterwards. 
Page 8/65
And you and I have more 
in common now that we're 
both afraid of sex. 
That's consoling. 
I miss it. 
I mean, I don't know how to 
get close to men without it. 
There's your boyfriend. 
So what? 
There's yours. 
[ Snorting ] 
Well, it's been 10 months 
and 17 days, 
and the only man 
who looked safe to me 
was Dr. Goodman. 
And I wasn't 
attracted to him. 
Then it seemed like I wasn't 
attracted to anybody, 
and that scared me 
more than AIDS did. 
Where were you? 
God, I'm sorry. 
I got a great surprise. 
What? 
This is where we're going 
on our vacation. 
Okay. 
"Oasis Health Spa." 
They're all exercising. 
That's not a vacation. 
There's all kinds 
of social events. 
Look. There's dancing, parties. Look how pretty it is. 
I don't know. 
My mom told me about 
a cruise to Hawaii... 
where we can 
lay out in the sun 
and be blobs for a week. 
That's a vacation. 
Yeah, but what kinda guys 
Page 9/65
are we gonna meet? 
At this place at least 
we know everybody's 
into being healthy. 
It'll help me 
with my paranoia. 
Stacy. How's it goin'? 
[ Gasps ] 
Hi, Baylor. 
Do you remember him 
from the Fringe festival? 
Oh, yeah. Hi. 
Stacy, I'm into something 
totally different now. 
[ Shudders ] 
I can't even put it into words. Why don't you come over? 
[ Stuttering ] 
I'm sorry. We're having lunch. Oh, yeah. Okay, great. 
Let me give you 
my new address. 
My new number. 
Okay? 
It's a garage arrangement. 
Great. 
[ Sighs ] 
[ Giggles ] 
I gotta 
get out of this town. 
Good-bye! 
Yea! 
[ Giggling ] 
[ Man ] 
Yes, sir 
Ha, ha, yeah 
We're so 
color coordinated. 
God, we're gonna be 
the best lookin' 
ones there. 
[ Car Backfiring ] 
[ Man ] 
Me mind on fire 
Page 10/65
Me soul on fire 
Feelin' hot, hot, hot 
Party people 
All around me 
Feelin' hot, hot, hot 
Oh, what to do 
on a night like this 
Music sweet 
I can't resist 
We need 
a party song 
A fundamental jam 
Feelin' hot, hot, hot 
I want you two to know 
you got the biggest room 
in the place. 
Really? 
Yeah. It used to 
be the honeymoon suite 
when this was a regular hotel. Why don't you two 
take a look around? 
I'll get your luggage 
up to your room. 
Okay. 
Ready to go 
break some hearts? 
Uh-huh. 
Bye, darling. 
Bye. 
See people rockin' 
Hear people chantin' 
Feelin' hot, hot, hot 
[ Melissa ] 
Oh, wow! 
This is beautiful. 
Oh, my God. I feel 
so much healthier now, 
and we just checked in. 
It's in the air 
Celebration time 
Music sweet 
Captivates your mind 
We have 
Page 11/65
this party song 
This fundamental jam 
So we go 
room, boom, boom, boom 
[ Chorus ] 
Hot, hot, hot 
Come on. 
Hot, hot, hot 
How ya doin'? 
My name is Vinny. 
Oh. 
Hi. 
Hi. 
You girls better be nice to me. I came all the way from New York just to meet you. 
- Really? What part? 
- Actually, 
Paterson, New Jersey. 
You familiar with 
the Straight Street exit? 
Mmm. 
Not really. 
No? What ya do, you hop on 
the George Washington Bridge. 
When you get past 
the Leona Park exit, 
you pick up Highway 80... 
which is also known 
as the Passaic Highway. 
Vinny, I'm sorry, 
but we-we have to get back 
to our rooms. 
Our suitcases. 
Yeah. Sorry. Bye. 
That's your 
boyfriend. 
Did I say 
go West on 80? 
Hey, how ya doin'? 
My name's Vinny. 
I came all the way 
from New York just 
to meet with you. 
Page 12/65
A lot of people 
don't know that. 
Yeah. 
[ Continues ] 
Make way for the condom express. [ Melissa ] 
What's that? 
Just in case 
you fall in love. 
There's enough in there 
for the whole planet 
to fall in love. 
- Well, that's the point, 
Melissa. Hello? 
- [ Knocking ] 
[ Man ] 
Hello. 
Hi. 
Hi. 
Welcome to Oasis. 
Would you like 
to come in? 
Yeah. Okay. 
Room service. 
- Hi. 
- Hi. 
I'm Jamie. 
Uh, but for some reason, 
I don't think you're 
Chuck and Eli? 
Oh, no. This is Melissa, 
and I'm Stacy. 
What can we do for you? 
Uh-- Uh, part of my job 
is to take the measurements 
of all the male guests. 
- [ Scoffs ] 
- [ Chuckles ] 
Uh, you're not hiding 
Chuck and Eli in here, are you? No. 
[ Sighs ] 
Why don't you take our 
measurements? We gotta 
Page 13/65
get it over with anyway. 
Right. Right. 
[ Whispers ] 
Confidence. 
Well, come on. Who's first? 
These aren't really my hips. 
They're a cruel joke 
that runs in my family. 
Melissa, why are you 
being so hard on yourself? 
You look great. 
Yeah, 
I absolutely agree. 
Now, Melissa, I have yet to meet anyone who has come here totally satisfied with their bodies. 
Now, you may not have noticed, but I'm not exactly what you 
would call-- 
- Tall? 
- Tall. Yeah. 
And I've never 
liked my feet. 
Really? 
I love my feet. 
If you'd like me 
to provide you with 
some vital statistics... 
that can't be measured 
in a public place, 
I'd be happy 
to do so. 
You mean your I.Q.? 
My weight's okay. 
It's just the way I wear it. 
[ Gasps ] 
[ Woman ] 
Natural spring water. 
From deep underground. 
It purifies. It cleanses. 
And everyone must drink 
at least 10 glasses of it 
a day. 
Ooh! 
Page 14/65
How you doin', 
Megan? 
Pretty good. 
You look good. 
All right. 
Thank you. 
[ Jamie ] 
Come on, with some energy. 
Pick those knees up. 
Pick 'em up! 
Pick 'em up! 
Oh, come on, Bianca. 
Have some fun. 
[ Jamie Laughs ] 
[ Panting ] 
Megan obviously got 
the good trampoline. 
Don't let it get to you. 
Just think if you separated 
her individual body parts... 
with, say, like, 
a huge meat cleaver and then 
laid them out on a table, 
you wouldn't think 
she was such hot stuff. 
You got 
your flag? 
- Hi. I'm Nick. 
- I'm Stacy. 
Hi, Stacy. 
This is my friend 
Melissa. 
Hi, Melissa. 
Hi. 
Wow, did you guys 
get all dressed up for me? 
I'd love to say yes, but I was really just hoping we'd look 
fantastic in these beanies. 
And you will. 
But you need the flags 
for the full effect. 
Okay. 
Okay? 
Page 15/65

Dig in. 
Now remember, 
don't show your flag until 
Frankie gives you the word. 
- All right. 
- I hope you meet someone nice. Okay. 
[ Stacy ] 
Let's get a drink, okay? 
[ Melissa ] Okay. 
I need 
to cool off. 
Hi. 
Hey, hi. 
It's Chuck and Eli. 
Good to see you. 
Welcome. Welcome to 
the spa beverage center. 
You guys want 
something to drink? 
I take it that's got 
mineral water in it. 
Ninety-seven percent, 
just like your body. 
If it was like my body, 
it would be 97% ice cream. 
I'll have some 
guava juice, please. 
Okay. 
How about you, Melissa? 
You remembered my name. 
Hello! Okay, everybody. 
Get over here. Come on. 
Come back anytime day or night. I live for makin' this stuff. 
[ Emcee ] Okay, everybody. 
Get over here. Come on. Come on. Okay. 
That guy's got 
the biggest boner for you. 
Stacy, he makes 
fruit drinks. 
He's a nutritionist. 
You're a kindergarten teacher. Page 16/65

I say go for it. 
No way. He's one 
of those, you know, 
really nice guys... 
you just joke around with 
like somebody's brother. 
Wait. Where is everybody? 
I thought you disappeared, 
you all look so thin already! 
I can't believe it. 
[ Crowd Laughs ] 
This is International Night. 
Here's your chance to say... 
bonjour, guten abend, 
buongiorno and howdy 
to all your new best friends. 
[ Crowd Cheers, Applause ] 
I hope you kept your flags 
well hidden, because if you 
haven't guessed by now, 
the person whose flag 
matches yours will be your date for the evening, okay? 
But now the moment has come. 
So let's unfurl our flags. 
Let's take them out right now. Let's wave them up in the air, shall we? Come on. 
There we go. Wave them. 
- Yea! 
- There we go. 
This is how it works. 
You take your flag and 
you stick it in the lovely hole right on top of your head. 
That's right. 
Just like that. 
Then when I blow the whistle, 
you run, find your partner, 
fall in love and have babies. 
Yes, it's that easy. 
[ Chuckles ] 
Get ready, and-- 
[ Whistle Blows ] 
Page 17/65
[ Emcee ] 
Come on! Find him! Good! 
Stacy, I see my guy. 
He's gorgeous. 
Ecuador. Ecuador. 
Ecuador! 
Hello. 
I'm Matthew. 
Melissa. 
So. 
So. 
You know what 
I'm noticing? 
How significant 
a first encounter is. 
Every word forms 
an irreversible impression. 
Yeah. You look really good 
in that hat. 
Let's talk. 
What's your name again? 
Melissa. 
Melissa. 
Excuse me. Hi. 
Could you do me 
a little tiny favor? 
You see, the guy 
I got matched up with, 
I know him already. 
I was kinda hopin' to meet 
someone new. So, would you 
mind just trading with me? 
I think we should just 
stick to the rules. 
Listen, nobody is even 
gonna know about this. 
All right? 
This guy is so worth it. 
I mean, ooh! 
What's he like? 
Oh, total class. 
Way cool. 
You gotta meet him. 
You'll drop dead. 
Page 18/65
[ Sighs ] 
I don't think so. I'm s-- 
Please? As a personal 
little favor for me. 
I'm telling you. 
You're gonna be thanking me. 
[ Sighs ] 
Okay. 
Great. 
You know what Dutch men 
are like too, don't you? 
Real handsome 
and virile and big. 
Hey! Stacy! Holland. 
Do you fuckin' believe that? 
Mm-hmm. I can. 
[ Grunting ] 
Can I ask you 
a personal question? 
Sure. 
What do you think 
of this body, huh? 
Well, you're real muscular, and I'm sure some women like that. Oh, they do. 
I mean, this body is meant 
to be enjoyed by people, 
you know? 
I could trash it, but no, 
I choose to beautify it 
like Central Park. 
Great. Just stay away 
from it at night. 
Oh, come on, baby. 
Be brave. 
Let's take 
a little carriage ride 
through the park, huh? 
No, thanks. 
I've already seen it. 
No. Not all of it. 
Not that giant new monument 
goin' up, baby. Oh. 
I'm concerned about 
Page 19/65
this penis size thing. 
I wanna know how men feel. 
Is it really such a big deal 
with you guys? 
Like, do you obsess about it? 
Do you measure it and compare it to the penis next to yours 
in the men's room? 
Do you secretly wish 
there was some sort of 
penis development cream... 
or machine at the gym? 
Gary told me 
they're all the same size 
when they're erect. 
[ Exhales ] 
So, anyway, 
like I was sayin', 
I'm driving this rich couple 
around in my limo, right? 
Then, get this. 
Mr. Big Bucks waves a couple 20s in front of my face, 
says he wants me 
to get it on with his wife 
while he watches, right? 
You know what 
I'm talkin' about, 
right, snapper head? 
Yeah, good. 
Anyway, next thing you know, 
bada-bing, bada-bang. 
The lady climbs 
over the front seat, 
hops on the armrest... 
and starts beggin' me 
to rip off her gown. 
She's gettin' all hot, 
naturally, and he is too... 
from all this heavy breathin' 
I hear in the backseat. 
He's yellin', 
"Nail her, nail her!" 
[ Chuckles ] 
Page 20/65
I look in the rearview. 
The guy's havin' some kind 
of asthma attack. 
Turns out he's yellin', 
"Inhaler, inhaler!" 
So we gotta do a little 
detour over to St. Vincent's. 
They get out. 
I don't see no money 
and worst of all, 
the Vin Man's left with 
a very frustrated Mr. Peabody. [ Bites Nails, Spits ] 
I only hope that woman 
is resilient enough to overcome her unfulfilled desires for you. You know, Matthew's 
a psychologist. 
I just love therapy. 
I think everyone 
should be in therapy. 
That would be good for me. 
Actually, 
I'm here to do research 
for a book I'm writing... 
on the psychosexual tendencies of premenopausal females. 
Yeah, me too. 
Vinny, look, you don't have 
to walk me all the way there. 
It's okay. 
Oh, no. No, no. 
I'm your date. 
You're my responsibility. 
Safety. There are a lot 
of creeps around here. 
You don't know that. 
All right, Vinny. 
Thanks. Bye. 
Hey, that's nice carpet 
you got in there. 
Is that new? 
Vinny, that's it. 
The date's over. 
Page 21/65
Vinny, look, 
you've been all over me 
for the past three hours. 
I think 
I've been pretty tolerant... 
because it seems like 
there's a very funny, 
appealing guy in there. 
Somewhere. 
Good night. 
Maybe I'll come in. 
We'll talk about it. 
That's a valid point. 
Bye. 
Yeah, I mean, uh-- 
[ Sighs ] 
Maybe we'll do it 
again some time, huh? 
Yeah. I gotta go anyway. 
Really. No, Stacy. 
Stacy, don't beg. 
It don't look good on you. 
Really, another time. 
Please, please, please. 
I mean, I realize-- 
I'm the best 
from the East 
I'm a wild crazy beast 
I'm the Vin Man 
Please, honey. 
Not tonight. 
[ Sighs ] 
[ Karate Yell ] 
[ Vinny Grunting ] 
That's a boy. 
Here you go. 
[ Screams ] 
[ Instructor ] 
97, 98, 99-- 
[ Man ] Keep goin'! 
Ooh! 
It's horrible. 
It's not that bad, Melissa. 
Yes, it is. 
Page 22/65
I feel like 
a windshield 
wiper. 
[ Groans ] 
[ Grunting ] 
[ Giggling ] 
[ Laughing ] 
[ Panting ] 
[ Groans ] 
[ Gasps ] 
[ Stacy ] 
Melissa, 
there's your boyfriend. 
[ Gasps ] 
[ Laughs ] 
We gotta do it. 
Let's go. 
[ Whimpers ] 
[ Scoffs ] 
I can't. 
I can't either, 
but we have to. 
Come on. 
You havin' fun? 
Yes. 
This is the most perfect date 
I've ever been on. 
Stacy, how are you? 
Jim Farrell. 
We went to the prom together. 
I took Stacy's virginity. 
How about that? 
Nick, get me 
outta here. 
No, wait. 
I wanna thank you. 
'Cause of all the help you 
gave me with my trig homework, I got accepted to M.I.T. 
I'm not 
an underachiever anymore. 
Congratulations. 
Thanks. Yeah. 
How have 
Page 23/65
you been? 
Fine. 
I've missed you. 
You've changed 
my life, you know. 
After being with you, I had 
the courage to sit down... 
and write a Pulitzer Prize 
winning novel. 
You might just recognize 
the heroine. 
- Who are you? 
- Kenny Kreiger. 
Don't you remember? 
[ Scoffs ] 
You touched it. 
Thanks so much 
for doing that, 
by the way. 
I bragged to everyone 
at school about it. 
Now I'm so popular, 
I'm running for 
class president. 
[ Groans ] 
Psst. Psst. Psst. 
Stacy. Stacy, 
remember me? 
Mike Sullivan-- 
The guy that never 
called you back. 
Well, I've been paying for 
that mistake every day since. 
I'm a complete failure. 
I can't hold a steady job. 
I had to move back in 
with my parents. 
I'd call you now, 
but they won't let me 
use the phone. 
They just 
won't let me use-- 
I'll always 
call you back. 
Page 24/65
You have nothing 
to worry about with me. 
Nothing? 
Nothing. 
And you'll be starting 
a clean slate. 
[ Moans ] 
Even though 
I'm incredibly sexy, 
I have never... 
been to bed 
with anyone... 
in my entire life. 
Oh, my God. 
[ Man ] 
Do you, Melissa, 
take Gary to be 
your lawfully wedded husband, 
to honor and cherish 
from this day forth, 
as long as 
you both may live? 
[ Melissa ] I do. 
Gary, do you take 
Melissa to be your 
lawful wedded wife, 
to honor and cherish from 
this day forth for as long 
as you both may live? 
I do. 
[ Man ] 
Stop! 
Melissa, you don't 
have to marry him. 
I'll marry you. 
- I'll marry you. 
- I'll marry you, Melissa. 
Who are you? 
You don't know me. 
But your parents do, 
and they love me. 
- Melissa. 
- I love you, Melissa. 
Melissa, I love you. 
Page 25/65
I'll marry you. 
Melissa, I love you. 
You can trust me. 
I love you, Melissa. 
[ Men ] 
I love you, Melissa. 
I'll marry you. 
It was the weirdest dream. 
I have no idea 
how those thoughts 
got into my head. 
I have no imagination. 
You're horny. 
I am not horny. 
I hate that word. 
I'm extraordinarily horny. 
I haven't had sex 
since a year ago, April. 
Wow. That's an even longer 
stretch than me. Why? 
Well, I found out my boyfriend was seeing other women, 
and I had to end it. 
It was making me 
too nervous. 
Yeah. 
Now when you're with a guy, 
you're not just sleeping 
with him. 
You're sleeping 
with everyone 
they've had sex with. 
And everyone 
they've had sex with. 
[ Together ] 
And everyone 
they've had sex with. 
Gee, I'm a lot 
more experienced 
than I thought I was. 
[ Giggles ] 
What do you miss most 
about sex? 
[ Sighs ] 
Page 26/65
I miss falling asleep 
with someone's arms around me. - And the feeling of... 
- Orgasm? 
[ Chuckles ] 
I love orgasms. 
[ Groans ] 
I'm sick of my Mighty Intruder vibrator with the flexible shaft and the textured head. 
[ Both Laugh ] 
I wish I missed it 
as much as you guys do. 
What about Gary? 
Didn't you guys have some 
down and dirty sex? Hmm? 
Well, um, one time, 
we did it twice in a row. 
And the first time 
it wasn't too bad. 
And the second time, 
it took a lot longer. 
And... I came so close. 
Haven't you ever 
had an orgasm? 
Oh, yeah, sure. 
[ Chuckles ] 
Well, not really. 
I mean, not with 
someone else in the room. 
Melissa, you never 
told me that before. 
Well, it's okay. 
I mean, it'll work itself out. Well, it took me a while 
to figure it out too. 
It's complicated for women. 
But I think 
it's-it's best on top. 
You know, if you take control 
and then, like, 
really move around... 
till you find 
the right spot? 
Page 27/65
Really? 
I like to be 
on the bottom. 
And I just 
move my hips like this. 
You can have one 
with the guy on top? 
- Mm-hmm? 
- I hate you. 
God, 
how do you do that? 
Just like this. 
What? Wh-What? 
- What are you doin'? 
A circle? 
- Mm-hmm. 
Yeah, just 
a little circle. 
Like a little "O." 
- What are you doing here? 
- Didn't you schedule 
a massage? 
You? 
The very best. 
Ay-yi-yi. 
[ Sighs ] 
[ Giggles ] 
I can't-- 
Um, I can't help it. 
Why don't we try 
a real easy exercise? 
It might help you 
loosen up a little. 
Okay. 
All right, I want you 
to pay attention 
to your breathing. 
In. 
[ Inhaling ] 
And out. 
[ Exhaling ] 
That's good. 
Now, try to imagine... 
that your body 
Page 28/65

is very heavy. 
That shouldn't be 
hard to imagine. 
[ Whispers ] 
Hey, only positive thoughts. 
Okay. 
[ Screams, Giggling ] 
[ Piano ] 
[ Chattering, Laughing ] 
[ Stops ] 
[ Resumes ] 
- Oh, hi. 
- Sounds great. 
Yeah, thanks. 
It's just somethin' 
I've been workin' on. 
Don't let me interrupt you. 
No, no, you're not. 
I was stuck anyway. 
Do you write a lot of songs? 
I used to. 
I used to be in a band. 
Ever heard of 
Bruce Springsteen? 
Yeah. 
I have a lot 
of his records. 
[ Laughs ] 
No, I really 
was a musician, 
but I, um-- I gave it up 
for a rewarding career 
as a health shaper. 
Don't you miss it? 
You're really talented. 
- Really? 
- Yeah. 
Yeah. Thanks. 
I do. I do miss it, 
but I can't complain. 
I'm gettin' paid 
to stay in shape, right? 
What about your plans later? 
I mean, after your spa career. Page 29/65

I don't know. 
There's some things 
I'm workin' on. 
I'm puttin' 
some things together. 
I'm workin' on stuff. 
There's a lot 
of things goin' on. 
Right. 
See you later. 
Get back to work. 
[ Chuckles ] 
[ Rock ] 
[ Chattering, Laughing ] 
Hey, 
what's goin' on? 
[ Grunting ] 
How about one 
of your special drinks? 
I thought you'd never ask. 
That's 
a pretty dress. 
Thank you. 
It makes you 
look feminine. 
Melissa, why don't we dance? 
Okay. 
Okay? 
Jamie, back to work. 
I need an aggressive 
beverage. 
Let's dance. 
Here I go 
She's a wild card 
Won't let go 
She's a wild card 
[ Continues ] 
The way you move, 
it's so expressive. 
Most women would be 
too embarrassed to really 
let themselves go like that. 
Do you know how 
complex you are, Melissa? 
Page 30/65
Um, I think so. 
I feel the need 
to understand you, 
to know why you are 
who you are... 
and how you 
became that way. 
And when. 
How about a real drink, 
huh? 
Oh, I don't know. 
You don't know? 
Come on. Take a shot, baby. 
Get this party rollin'. 
Well, just a little. 
I don't want to ruin 
the effects of my colonic. 
Then when I was 13 
I got caught plagiarizing 
from the World Book... 
and my dad ripped my phone 
out of the wall. 
Then he said I had to return 
my American Legion award 
in front of the whole school... because I didn't 
deserve it... 
because you're supposed 
to be honest. 
And so I cried the whole night because I couldn't figure out... how I was going to 
stand in front 
of the whole school... 
and give back my 
American Legion award. 
They would think 
I was crazy. 
The next day at school 
my heart was pounding 
the whole day-- 
Oh, I can 
tell you later. 
[ Sighs ] 
Page 31/65
Melissa, did you know that women experience 63% more heightened neurological sensitivity... 
during the arousal phase 
than during climax itself? 
Really? 
I like all the phases. 
I should stop. 
But you don't want to, 
right? 
I feel so many things 
right now. 
This is kind of interesting. 
They were really easy 
getting on. 
[ Applause, Cheering ] 
Hello! 
I cannot tell you 
how excited I am to bring you 
an unexpected treat tonight. 
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm proud to present our very own... 
Mr. Nick Lawrence. 
[ Cheering ] 
[ Electric Piano ] 
I can really see you 
You are really here 
And when we touch 
You don't disappear 
It's nothin' 
like I planned 
It's all that I'm worth 
It's strange and beautiful 
It's heaven and earth 
And who you really are 
And who I really am 
Come shinin' through 
Shinin' through 
[ Continues ] 
[ Kissing ] 
What's the matter? 
[ Grunts ] 
We have a problem. 
What is it? 
Page 32/65
[ Sighs ] 
I can't. I'm sorry. 
Is it me? 
No, no, no. 
It's not you. 
It's me. I'm not 
attracted to you. 
Oh. 
Now, I don't want you to 
take this as a rejection... 
but rather as an acceptance 
between two people whose needs are profoundly incompatible. 
And you're not alone. 
I'm going to devote 
an entire chapter 
to this in my book. 
- You want me 
to walk you back? 
- No, that's okay. 
Melissa, 
I know you're hurting, 
but whatever you do 
don't judge those feelings. 
They're just feelings. 
They're great. 
[ Sighs ] 
[ Sighs ] 
I really wish you 
hadn't seen that. 
We gotta find a hero 
Somewhere, sometime 
We gotta be strong 
With love on our mind 
Oh, no 
Rescue each other 
Hold on in the end 
To the hand of a stranger 
The hand of a friend 
- Behind your eyes 
- Everything I believed in 
[ Background Singers ] 
Ohh 
I see myself in you 
Page 33/65
Behind your eyes 
Behind your eyes 
I found something new 
There behind your eyes 
Behind your eyes 
I found the face 
that I never knew 
Before 
Behind your eyes 
[ Cheering, Applause Continue ] Oh! 
[ Vinny Groans ] 
- Hey! 
- Vinny! 
- Hi. 
- You're drunk. 
It's happy hour. 
Could've fooled me. 
Oh, you want a shot? 
No, I better not. 
Okay. 
There. 
That'll make you 
feel better. 
[ Sighs ] 
It's good stuff, 
huh? 
Ahh. 
It's good, see. 
We'll have 
our own party. 
Okay? 
Just me and you. 
What kind of a party? 
Um-- All right, 
this is what I'm gonna do. 
I'm gonna tell you a joke, 
a funny joke, 
a joke you're gonna like. 
What happens-- 
You laugh, you gotta 
take a shot of this. 
If you don't laugh, 
I gotta take a shot. 
Page 34/65
Okay. 
All right, 
here's the joke. 
All right, there's 
this old guy, right? 
He's like 80 years old, 
maybe 81. 
It doesn't matter after 30. 
You know what I'm sayin'? 
So anyway, 
this guy says, uh, 
he wants one last night... 
of really havin' 
a good time, you know. 
So he goes out, 
he hops a few bars, 
meets this bimbo, right? 
Bada-bing, bada-bang. 
They're goin' at it 
all night long. 
She was young, 
like 19 years old. 
I'm surprised the guy 
even lived through that, 
right? 
What's the funny part? 
I'm gettin' to that. 
I'm gettin' 
to the funny part, 
all right? 
Don't put me 
under pressure here. 
So now what happens, 
the guy goes to confession 
a few days later, right? 
So he's tellin' 
the priest everything, 
like play-by-play, 
what happened 
that night. 
So the priest says, 
"Say 20 Hail Marys, 
and you'll get forgiveness." 
So the guy tells the priest, 
Page 35/65
"I ain't even Catholic." 
So the priest says to him, 
"Then why are you tellin' me 
this whole story?" 
He goes, 
"I'm not just tellin' you. 
I'm tellin' everybody." 
[ Giggles ] You see 
what I'm sayin' to you? 
[ Chuckles ] 
I don't get it. 
Well, they're not 
all golden, honey, 
you know? 
What about you? 
You got a joke? 
Uh, this is one that 
the kids at school told me. 
Why did the chicken go 
halfway across the street? 
Why? 
He wanted 
to lay it on the line. 
You're not laughing. 
Oh, not yet. 
Not yet. 
Inside, it's building. 
It's building. 
About a half hour from now 
I'll be rollin' 
all over the beach. 
You won't 
be able to stop me. 
I'll be in hysterics. 
[ Giggling ] 
Wait. I get one, to be fair. 
Okay. 
All right. 
I tell you what. 
You like charades? 
You like charades? 
All right. 
All right, um-- 
What is this? 
Page 36/65
It's a movie, right? 
Nick, I think we should 
talk about something, 
but it's no big deal. 
What? 
Well, it's 
kinda hard to say. 
Well, then, whisper it. 
It's been a long time 
for me, and the thing is, 
I feel like I should 
ask you questions, 
but I don't want 
to interrogate you. 
Medical history questions? 
Yes. 
You have to be so careful, 
and you don't know 
who anybody's been with. 
I'm not saying anything 
about you, but I-- 
I know. Shh. 
Don't worry. 
I'll take care of it. 
This is a miracle. 
For once, 
it's all up to him. 
No tubes, no jellies, 
no furtive trip 
to the bathroom. 
I can just sit back 
and let it happen. 
I don't have 
to do anything. 
I'm not too good 
with these things. 
You think you 
can give me a hand 
putting it on? 
Sure. 
[ Man ] The good news 
is that your Blue Cross 
will cover this visit. 
The bad news is 
Page 37/65
that you have herpes 
simplex one and two, 
trichomonas, gonorrhea, 
acute immune deficiency 
syndrome-related complex, 
vulvar lesions, 
secondary syphilis, 
venereal warts... 
and a potentially 
unbearable case 
of the crabs. 
But he was only 
the third guy in my life, 
and the first one 
didn't count. 
No, all contact counts. 
But I thought 
I had safe sex. 
Oh, no sex is safe enough 
for you, Melissa. 
Well, enjoy the rest 
of your vacation. 
[ Melissa Screams ] 
[ Ducks Quacking ] 
[ Groans ] 
We must've 
fallen asleep. 
[ Both Groan ] 
Oh, I wish 
I were dead. 
[ Heaving ] 
[ Heaving Continues ] 
I'll be all right. 
Cigarette, honey? 
No. 
[ Lighter Flicks ] 
Uh-- 
Where you goin'? 
I'm going back to my room 
to take a shower. 
Hey, don't worry 
about it. 
You know, uh, 
we'll do it again 
Page 38/65
some time. 
[ Sighs ] 
Chicks. 
I'm the best from the East 
I'm a wild, crazy beast 
I'm the Vin Man 
[ Chuckles ] 
[ Nick ] 
That was the most intense 
it's ever been for me. 
I feel like I died 
for a second. 
[ Stacy ] 
Me too. 
But it wasn't like dying. 
It was more like sinking. 
[ Sighs ] 
[ Nick ] 
It was like flying. 
Yeah, flying. 
[ Nick ] 
Not just flying, 
but actually hurtling 
through outer space, 
galaxy after galaxy. 
Sorry. I can't get 
a cab here in time. 
You won't be able 
to make the 8: 
Oh, yes, I will. 
Well, there's 
another one at 2:00. 
No, I can't stay here 
any longer. 
Will you please see 
that Stacy Hunter gets that? 
Melissa, you're not 
leaving us, are you? 
Melissa, seeking escape 
from a challenging 
environment... 
points to potentially 
very serious 
Page 39/65
personality deficits. 
You really ought 
to consider analysis. 
[ Grunts ] 
[ Melissa ] 
Asshole. 
[ Spits, Coughing ] 
Hop in the back, honey. 
Thanks. 
Thanks. 
All right. 
Bye-bye. 
Can I make 
the bus to L.A.? 
Just missed it. 
[ Exhales ] 
Damn it. 
[ Exhales ] 
Next one leaves 
at 2: 
Okay. 
I'll take one 
for the 2: 
Excuse me. 
Melissa told me 
to give you this. 
Thanks. 
Thank you. 
What is it? 
[ Sighs ] 
Melissa 
went back to L.A. 
All my fault. 
I gotta go home. 
You're just gonna leave? 
I have to. 
She doesn't have 
anybody else. 
Come on. Stacy! 
Stacy. 
I wanna go with you. 
Well, I'd love that, 
Page 40/65
but what about 
your classes? 
I'll get someone 
to cover for me. 
[ Laughing ] 
I'm gonna go with ya. 
[ Woman Crying ] 
[ Crying Continues ] 
I lied. 
I was extremely 
attracted to you. 
I just didn't want you 
to see my unusually small penis. Wait. 
Melissa, you're alive! 
Jamie, I am. 
Kiss me. 
Jamie. 
Kiss me. 
Jamie. 
Jamie. 
Jamie. 
Jamie. 
Jamie. You're here. 
Yeah. 
What are you doing here? 
I just wanted to make sure 
you were all right. 
I guess I better pack 
Melissa's stuff too, huh? 
I hope she's okay. 
You know, 
I've been thinkin', Stacy. 
Yeah? 
I might wanna stay 
in L.A. for a while. 
But you'll lose your job. 
Yeah, well, maybe that's 
not such a bad thing. 
I mean, L.A.'s where all 
the music people are, right? 
Yeah. 
I could 
give it a shot. 
Page 41/65
You should. 
You're so good. 
[ Mutters ] 
And you could stay 
at my place. 
Really? 
- [ Sighs ] 
- Do you really 
have to go home? 
I don't know. 
I just feel so left out 
at that place. 
But if I go home, 
then it's like I just gave up. Besides, what if my body starts to crave that mineral water? 
[ Brakes Squeaking ] 
Can we have two tickets, please? Yeah. We're going 
to Hollywood. 
- Why don't you just put it 
on your credit card? 
- I don't have one. 
- Really? 
- [ Laughs ] 
Yeah. 
I don't believe in 'em. 
Oh. 
Well, look, just put 'em both 
on my credit card, and you can write me a check later. 
No checking account. 
Oh. Well-- 
Besides, I've got more 
in my wallet. 
[ Nick ] 
Goin' to Hollywood. 
Feel it, feel it 
[ Continues ] 
Jamie, 
I am so glad you're back. 
You gotta take over Nick's 
aerobics classes for me. 
Why? Where's Nick? 
Page 42/65
He eloped with Stacy back 
to L.A. God, it was beautiful. What? 
Jamie, please. 
I tried teaching 
one of the classes myself. 
I almost passed out. 
It was really embarrassing. 
All right, sure. No problem. 
Thanks, sport. 
Nick. 
I can't believe it. 
Stacy would 
never get married 
without telling me. 
Let's go see 
what's going on. 
Why didn't she tell me? 
Hi, Chopper. 
Hey, there she is-- 
my favorite tenant. 
Hi, Gus. 
This is Nick. 
Oh. Yeah. 
Nice to meet ya. 
Nick. 
Hey, you can put those bags 
out by the dumper. 
Okay, buddy? 
[ Giggles ] 
Come on. 
Oh, wow! 
This is beautiful. 
My God. 
This is beautiful. 
Stacy! 
Where are you? 
I'm in your apartment. 
Where the hell are you? 
I'm here. 
Why are you there? 
Well, 
you were in trouble. 
So I came to help, 
Page 43/65
and I dragged Nick 
back with me. This is nuts! 
Didn't you guys run off 
to get married? 
No. Like 
I'd almost marry someone 
I met two seconds ago. 
I mean, I know him enough 
to know I wanna know him better, but that's not the point. 
The point is, 
your note scared me! 
I'm-- I'm really sorry 
I got you all worried. 
All right. 
At least I know you're okay. 
Stacy, I hope things work out 
between you and Nick. 
Yeah, thanks. 
Look, I gotta go. 
Are you sure you're okay? 
Are you sure you don't 
want me to come back there? 
I-I-I'm fine. 
I gotta go. 
All right. Bye. 
[ Sighs ] 
Guess I'm not 
going anywhere. 
I don't get it. 
I'm hot, tight, 
vastly entertaining. 
I thought 
that's what women want. 
I know the feeling, pal. 
What do you say we go 
into the gift shop... 
and get you a nice, 
free Oasis T-shirt? 
How's that sound? 
You know, I used to have it 
all figured out. 
It's like women changed 
when I had my back turned. 
Page 44/65
Yeah, it's rough. 
You know, 
I read something. 
Where is it? 
Here it is. 
Here you go. 
"The Pretend You're Sensitive 
Handbook." 
Nice save, hon. 
Yeah. 
I can't believe 
how much stuff I got. 
But I want you to know... 
I'm not gonna take up 
any of your closet space. 
What I'd like to do-- 
Hon-- 
What I'd like to do is 
stick everything over here 
in the corner... 
and then get one of those 
cardboard drawer things, 
you know. 
You don't have to do that. 
I-I can make room. 
- You're so easy to live with. - Yeah. 
[ Chuckles ] 
So here. 
Here's my contribution 
to the apartment. 
Oh. 
Well, 
I guess I'll just go put 
these away right now. 
That's great. 
Think I got another one 
in here too, hon. 
[ Panting ] 
Help. 
Jamie, you know, 
you've done everything 
a human could possibly do 
this week to make me happy. 
Page 45/65
Not everything. 
Well, 
I-- 
Yeah, I know. 
But, uh, you-- 
Just, like-- 
I feel like I-- You-- 
Uh-- 
It just wouldn't 
feel right for me 
to get romantic with you. 
Why not? 
Well, um, you're not 
the usual kind of guy 
that I'm attracted to. 
Oh. No? 
I mean, you're 
really attractive, but-- 
but, um-- 
I mean, I thought maybe 
we should just stick 
to being friends. 
[ Scatting ] 
Hey, Stace! 
You wanna cruise up and down 
Sunset Boulevard? 
You can show me 
where all the stars 
hang out, hon. 
Oh, Nick, you won't believe 
what just happened. 
I called into work. 
There's a big emergency. 
They need me. I gotta go. 
Really? 
Yeah. Oven problems 
or something. 
Oh. 
But I'll be back 
just as soon as I can, 
and I'll call you, okay? 
You just stay here 
and have a good time, okay? 
Okay. Hey, 
Page 46/65
and I love it here, hon. 
Oh. 
[ Door Opens ] 
You think it's too late 
to use the stereo? 
[ Door Closes ] 
[ Door Opens ] 
I need a small car that's 
really easy to handle. 
You'll be fine. 
Just take your time 
and don't be intimidated 
by it, okay? 
Okay. Thanks, Keith. 
[ Engine Starts, Revs ] 
[ Tires Squealing ] 
[ Crying ] 
Ah. 
[ Kissing ] 
[ Exhales, 
Sniffles ] 
Wow. Do I look 
any different? 
Gosh, I'm 
so good in bed. 
Jamie. 
What? 
I never thought 
it would happen to me. 
You're a genius. 
I'm a genius. 
I bet I could 
even do it again. 
Maybe we should wait 
a few minutes. 
[ Chuckles ] 
Okay. 
Okay. 
[ Tires Screech ] 
[ Door Closes ] 
Can I have the key 
to Room 34, please? 
Stacy, so nice to see you. 
Uh, do you have 
Page 47/65
a few minutes? 
I mean, it occurred to me. 
I don't even know 
where you work. 
Where I work? 
Yeah, your career plans, 
your dreams, 
your aspirations. 
I really wanna hear 
all about them. 
What I want? 
I don't even know. 
Ask me what 
anyone else wants. 
Give me three seconds, 
I'll figure out 
your whole entire life. 
Would you... 
maybe wanna share 
something with me... 
about your 
childhood perhaps? 
Vinny, what the hell 
are you talking about? 
I'm in a big rush. 
Look, I have to go talk 
to Melissa. 
'Cause if I don't figure out 
something about my life soon, 
I'm gonna crack. 
I respect 
your strength, Stacy, 
and I think you've got 
a lot of potential. 
- Mmm. 
- [ Door Opens ] 
Stacy. 
Oh, my God. I'm sorry. 
I should have knocked. 
I-I didn't even think. 
I'm sorry. Good-bye. 
Stacy, what are you 
doing here? 
Oh, I didn't mean 
Page 48/65
to barge in on you guys. 
Something's the matter. 
Why are you here? 
I don't know. 
He's in my apartment. 
Who? 
There's sneakers all over 
the living room, 
and soon there's 
gonna be cardboard drawers. 
But who? 
He thinks I'm a huge doll, 
and the worst part 
is he's so nice. 
- Who's he? 
- Nick. 
Stacy, congratulations. 
I hear you're married. 
- I'm not married! 
- Oops. 
- I'm not married. 
- Stacy, come in here. 
Hi, Jamie. 
Hi. 
We're just gonna talk 
for a second. 
I'd leave, but I'm naked. 
That's okay. 
We'll just go in here. 
Why is Nick 
suddenly living with you? 
'Cause I thought 
I was in love with him. 
Uh-huh? 
[ Exhales ] 
I think it was the sex. 
I was celibate 
for so long, 
I started 
to feel like a can 
of kitchen cleanser. 
You know, sterile 
and gritty and abrasive. 
And when we made love-- 
Page 49/65
I don't know. 
I felt like 
a human again. 
An mammal with breasts. 
[ Sighs ] 
And also he's 
very talented. He's-- 
Stop. 
Not the talented thing. 
Okay. 
I know. You're right. 
He's the same guy again. 
So, what are you 
gonna do? 
Well, I guess maybe 
we could stay together... 
until Nick gets settled 
in L.A., and then when he-- 
Stacy. 
End it. 
Go back to L.A. 
and just do it. 
Shit. 
You're right. 
I am, aren't I? 
I'm gonna do it. 
It's a test of my-- 
my new maturity. 
[ Whispering ] 
Oh, I'm sorry. 
Oh, Jamie's in there. 
I know. 
Can you believe it? 
[ Whispering ] 
[ Gasps ] 
Oh! 
Oh! Did he have one too? 
[ Shower Running ] 
[ Frankie Singing ] 
[ Screams ] 
It didn't work! 
What? What? What? 
It didn't work! 
What? 
Page 50/65
The book. The book. 
Don't get mad. 
I'm not mad. 
Look, a guy like me 
cannot pretend. 
Do you understand 
I'm from Jersey? 
It's like-- I know 
this guy, Joey, right? 
He-- He's in jail now. 
He kills three people 
with a knife. 
But he didn't fake it. 
He did it! 
Look-- Look, Frankie. 
I-I gotta get out of here. 
I gotta get back to my roots, 
put my head together, 
do some thinkin'. 
Hey, I'm sorry. I tried. 
Oh, you-- 
you've been beautiful. 
You're special. 
I relate to you. 
[ Door Closes ] 
Good-bye. 
[ Tires Screeching ] 
Think she'll do it? 
I hope so. 
Hey, Stacy! Stacy! 
Yo, Stace, 
would you give me 
a lift to the bus station? 
I've had it 
with this place, really. 
I promise 
I won't hit on you. 
I won't even breathe. 
Oh-- 
Come on. 
Okay, okay. Hurry up. 
Thanks. 
I appreciate this. 
Really. 
Page 51/65
Oh, man. 
No problem. 
So, why are you leaving? 
I was havin' too much fun 
for one person. 
I tell ya somethin'. 
I give up on this whole 
relationship thing. 
I mean, I was bombin' out 
so bad at that place. 
I would've shaved 
between my eyebrows 
if I thought it would help. 
Tell me somethin'. 
How do you do it? 
Do what? 
This whole man-woman 
relationship thing. 
I mean, 
how do you do it? 
Like-- Like when you're 
with your friends, you know, 
and, uh, you can just talk 
and do whatever you do. 
Someone you're 
comfortable with, you know? 
Only like, you know-- 
like on a romantic level. 
[ Stacy Narrating ] 
Okay, when I first met Vinny, 
I thought this guy 
is a living argument 
for birth control. 
But as I get 
to know him better, 
I realize he's just like 
the rest of us-- a mess. 
- [ Tires Screech ] 
- [ Engine Stops ] 
[ Sighs ] 
So I dropped Vinny off 
at the bus station... 
[ Mouthing Words ] 
and rushed home 
Page 52/65
to face Nick. 
I'd rehearsed every word 
I was gonna say... out loud. 
I'd covered all the angles. 
There was no way he could 
talk me out of it. 
[ Nick ] 
Stace? 
Nick. 
Hey! 
I went shopping. 
Boy, these are 
gonna last forever. 
And wait till you see 
the stuff I got for you 
to make us breakfast. 
Waffles. 
Great stuff, huh? 
And I got this big thing 
of butter. Look at it. 
Nick! Nick. 
This isn't working. 
Why? 
You don't like waffles? 
I-- It's-- 
It's not-- 
It's not that. 
It's that we don't-- 
don't have any syrup. 
[ Laughs ] 
Ahh. 
You know, it's like 
I was meant to come here. 
I mean, everything-- 
It feels, man-- 
It feels so right. 
Really? 
Yeah. 
I feel so inspired. 
You know, last night 
when you were working, 
I started 
on this new song. 
Oh, guess what 
Page 53/65
it's called. 
"Stacy." 
Wow. 
[ Laughs ] 
It's got this really 
great bass line in it. 
Now, just listen to this. 
Um-- 
[ Humming Bass Line ] 
[ Continues ] 
Nick, that's great, 
but-- 
Mm-hmm. 
Okay, wait. 
[ Continues ] 
Stacy 
- Nick-- 
- Oh, Stacy 
Okay. Anyway, 
that's all I got so far. 
Really, I like it. 
Uh-- [ Clears Throat ] 
But, uh, look, uh-- 
This is kinda 
difficult to say, 
but I, uh-- 
I kinda have a problem. 
Well, is it about money? 
Aw, honey, don't worry. 
I can get some dumb job 
until somethin' else happens. 
I am feelin' so confident. 
Really. 
It's not about the money. 
It's about us 
living together. 
Well, you wanna get 
a bigger place? 
No, it's not the size 
of the apartment, Nick. 
Well, what-- 
what is it? 
Look, I know that I c-- 
convinced you to come here, 
Page 54/65
and I know I kinda 
helped you quit your job, 
but it's about 
our relationship. 
Nick. 
Yeah. 
It's not gonna work. 
Well, 
I thought we had something 
pretty special here. 
It's not your fault. 
It's me. 
I'll end up taking care 
of you, and I'll forget 
all about myself. 
Oh, you don't have 
to take care of me. 
Christ. 
Nick, I will. 
You don't know me. 
I-I'm that way with men. 
I-I-- I just lose myself. 
I disappear. 
You know, 
but you heard them when 
I was singin', didn't ya? 
They loved me. 
It's gonna be 
the same way here in L.A. 
I can't do it 
this time, Nick. 
I'm sorry. 
Okay. 
That's okay. 
But let me tell you, 
you're making a big mistake, 
'cause I am gonna make it. 
Good. 
I'm gonna be huge. 
I'm gonna be bigger 
than huge. 
I'm gonna be on the cover 
of Rolling Stone magaz-- 
No, forget that. 
Page 55/65
I'm gonna be on the cover 
of Time magaz-- No! 
Forget that. 
I-- 
I am gonna have... 
more fans than Elvis! 
Good. 
Yeah! 
And I won't even be dead. 
Think about it. 
[ Exhales ] 
[ Stacy Narrating ] 
Well, Nick packed up 
his Heftys, 
and I haven't heard 
from him since. 
After Nick, I kind of 
took a break from guys 
for a while... again. 
You got me. 
I know. 
But I was 
hoping for something 
a little more romantic. 
Oh. 
Tell 'em 
about the letter. 
You think? 
Yeah, tell 'em. 
Okay. 
"Dear Stacy, 
I hope you don't mind me 
writing to you, 
but the only other letter 
I ever wrote was to 
the editor of Flex magazine, 
and that was just to say 
how much I enjoyed this 
particular article called--" 
[ Vinny's Voice ] 
"'Hammer Those Glutes Till Your Butt's Like A Bowling Ball.' 
So it wasn't 
exactly personal. 
Page 56/65
So, why do I now 
take pen in hand 
to write to you? 
Okay, it's like this. 
Ever since 
I got home from Oasis, 
things are different. 
Like, all of a sudden, 
I don't feel like 
hangin' out every night. 
I don't feel like 
hittin' on women. 
I don't even feel 
like drinkin' milk 
out of the carton. 
I feel-- 
[ Inhales ] 
I don't know. 
Serious. 
Like I'm in the midst 
of some heavy changes. 
I've forced myself to take 
a closer look at the Vin Man. 
You know, open 'im up, 
pull 'im out, 
dissect 'im like a frog. 
And I've decided 
to go after... 
a more sharply tailored, 
finely pleated, 
subtly striped look. 
[ Grunting ] 
And I've discovered 
I have a creative side 
to my personality. 
[ Humming ] 
Hey! 
[ Loud Sizzling ] 
Anyway, 
since most of my friends 
saw the Vin Man... 
as a larger-than-life, 
legendary figure, 
[ Hooting, Shouting ] 
Page 57/65
many are having difficulties 
relating to me at this time. 
But since you didn't 
know me for very long, 
I figured it might be easier 
for you to understand. 
Besides, you're one of 
the few people I know who could possibly appreciate all this." "Respectfully, 
your friend, 
Vincent Falcone." 
What can I say? 
Life is bizarre. 
Are you sure you have 
to go so early? 
Yeah, we still have another 
bottle of champagne. 
Oh, well, I'm kinda tired. 
Besides, you two 
should be alone. 
Here. 
Mwah! 
Good night, you. 
Bye-bye. 
Thanks. 
Happy New Year. 
Okay, thanks. 
Bye. 
[ Speakers: 
"Auld Lang Syne" ] 
[ Door Shuts ] 
Hey. 
Need a lift? 
[ Chuckles ] 
Vinny. 
What are you 
doing here? 
I was just drivin' 
around the neighborhood. 
Last night I-- 
Look, it's like this. 
It's Christmas Day. 
Page 58/65
I'm sittin' around 
my house, right? I'm all alone. So, uh, 
I hop in the limo. 
Twenty-four hours later, 
I wind up in Chicago. 
And I say to myself, 
"Vincent, 
where the hell 
are you goin'?" 
That's when it hits me. 
I'm comin' to see you. 
You drove all that way 
just to see me? 
Hey, only four days and, 
what, 18 speeding tickets? 
But it's okay. 
I got my own 
business now. Here. 
I got four of 'em. 
Four stretch limos. 
Yeah. 
Wow. 
Oh, yeah. 
Fully loaded. 
The works. 
Hey. But, look, I-- 
You know, I realize 
I didn't call or nothin', 
so, uh, if you got 
some plans, you know-- 
Uh, well, I was gonna-- 
[ Sighs ] 
I-I have nothin' to do. 
I'm just going home. 
Maybe we could 
do somethin'. 
I don't know. 
Maybe go play 
some miniature golf. 
You like golf? 
Vinny. 
It's late. 
Yeah, I know. 
Page 59/65
All right. 
That's all right, you know. 
I mean, hey, you know, 
I felt like takin' a drive 
anyway, you know, uh-- 
I mean, 
it's New Year's Eve, 
you know. 
You probably 
had a wild night 
or somethin'. 
I mean, who needs a visit 
from the Vin Man 
on New Year's Eve? 
You know what I'm sayin'? 
I understand. 
I mean-- 
Hey, look, you have 
a good New Year's, 
all right? 
I'm gonna, uh, take off. 
Vinny. 
You want some breakfast? 
Um, you know, 
I could eat somethin'. 
I'm kinda hungry. 
I been drivin' a while, 
you know. 
I can make you an omelet. 
[ Laughs ] 
Oh, yeah? 
You a good cook? 
I been doin' 
some cookin' myself. 
How 'bout I make you 
an omelet, huh? 
That would be nice. 
Okay, wait a minute. 
Hang on. I got-- 
Hang on. 
What? 
Wait. 
Merry Christmas. 
Ohh!

Oh, my God!

What's his name? 
I didn't give him a name. 
You-- You choose somethin'. 
[ Continues Giggling ] 
I don't know. 
He's chewing my hair up.
