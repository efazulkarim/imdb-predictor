REPORTER #10: We are now only days from this controversial experiment, this night of legalized

crime that people are now calling the Purge.

And there are protests all over.

Conflict between anti-Purge protesters and Purge supporters broke out early today in North

Carolina.

REPORTER #11: Yes, Susan, I'm here in Charlotte.

There's been about 20 arrests so far, and we'll keep you informed as protests are continuing.

(DISTANT SIREN WAILING)

Staten Island, the chosen site, has become the focus for the entire world.

We have reporters across the island who will be giving live updates for the next several days.



Let's go now to correspondent Van Jones, who's in Park Hill.

VAN: Yes, James. I'm here outside the Park Hill Towers, a low-income housing project, and I can

see citizens are...

Isaiah, our tower made the news.

ISAIAH: Are you serious?

(GROANS) g*dd*mn it.

(GROANS)

(SIGHS)

Dolores. Good morning.

Have you seen Tony?

My sink is leaking again.

Good morning, sweetie.

I'm so sick of this piece of sh*t building.

The damn elevator's down again, too.

As bad as my asthma is, got me sweating like a f*cking snitch.

We need five or six supers in this raggedy m*therf*cker.

I'll let him know what's up if I see him.

Thank you. You're welcome, sweetie.

Hey.

This bullshit experiment really happening, Ny?

Talk to you later, okay? All right, sweetie.

The Pope has continued his condemnation of the Purge.

And France's president, Lemercier, has called upon...

I'll see you later, bro. I'm out.

I'll see you tonight. A'ight.

JAMES: ...if the NFFA doesn't stop this, quote, "barbaric experiment."

Locally, protestors have started to gather at the evaluation sites, as well as outside local

government offices.

(WATER DRIPPING) So far, there has been no sign of v*olence, but tensions are high as the

clock ticks.

MAN: Are you an angry person?

Who ain't?

Just tell me what I need to do to get paid.

If you remain on Staten Island during the experiment, you will receive monetary compensation

of $5,000.

You'll give me $5,000 just to stay home during this thing?

How would you know if I stayed?

We would implant a tracking device in your arm.

Not harmful.

And if you decide to participate beyond that, there would be further compensation.

What do you mean, "participate"?

Go out, release your anger.

You mean k*ll someone?

If you feel compelled.

Okay. Let's do this.

I need the money.

NEWS ANCHOR: Let's go to our News Four on-the-scene reporter at the Park Hill Towers.

REPORTER: This is one of a dozen sites being set up across the island where citizens are signing up

to participate in the experiment.

They are also being psychologically evaluated here to determine their mental status before they

purge.

And they will be evaluated again after the experiment, if they survive, to see how they were

affected by the night that is being described as a "societal catharsis."

WOMAN: Are you angry?

Damn straight.

People around here been making fun of us our whole lives.

We keep to ourselves, but they just won't leave us alone.

Are you ever inclined to hurt someone?

What do you think, Doc?

The island was chosen because its demographic is a perfect representation...

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

(INDISTINCT CHATTER) REPORTER: There are numerous drug and street gangs on Staten Island.

Many are wondering if they'll participate.

Many citizens are leaving.

For those staying, the financial reward seems to be the incentive.

REPORTER #2: Despite the weather conditions, the protesters are out.

They have their signs, and their fists are raised.

They are against the Purge experiment that is happening.

This is wrong!

CROWD: Do not purge! Do not purge!

Walk away from their money!

Do not purge!

Do not participate! Do not purge!

Do not participate!

VAN: So we are here with Arlo Sabian.

He is the chief of staff for the NFFA.

He got this whole thing pushed through Congress.

Well, you got protests all over the place now.

Please. The idea of the Purge was analyzed for years.

We allowed island citizens to vote on participation.

They voted yes. Yeah, and you know why?

Because a lot of those people felt coerced by the fact they don't have money and you're offering

money.

So, what do you say to the lower-income people who are out here risking their lives tonight?

Well, Van, as with any scientific trial, those who participate receive payment.

You know, I'm gonna turn to you, Dr. Updale.

You are the behavioral scientist who actually came up with this whole experiment.

A lot of people have a lot of concerns about this, and one concern comes up over and over

again.

I want the truth from you.

Is the Purge a political device?

I do not work for the NFFA.

I did not conceive of the experiment for them.

The NFFA had the courage to test it, but the conceit is not a political one.

It is a psychological one.

The benefit of acting violently without worry of consequence, that's a freeing v*olence. "A freeing

v*olence."

Okay, that's a... that's a new one on me.

I have a question for you.

What is your definition of success?

Well, the level of participation in certain areas is key.

Uh, the Park Hill Towers, for example, are the center of this community.



If there's considerable participation there, I think that'll be a strong indication that this night is a

great success.

Well, we'll see. NYA: They have monetized and incentivized m*rder. CROWD: Yeah!

Walk away from their money! Yeah!

The wealthy areas are already clearing, but the NFFA knew that we, "the impoverished," would

stay if there was monetary gain.

(CROWD SHOUTING IN AGREEMENT)

This is another way to keep the brown and black people down!

CROWD: Yes!

(♫ HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING LOUDLY ♫)

(MUSIC STOPS) CROWD: Do not purge!

Do not participate! Do not purge!

Do not participate!

Do not purge!

Look at all of this.

Everybody want to be a gangster.

You really think these regular folk gonna pop each other like gangsters when the time comes?

sh*t yeah. People pissed.

They ain't got no money. They ain't got no food.

They gotta release their anger. Bullshit.

They participate, it'll be for that paper.

Trust me. Nah.

People gonna riot.

They gonna steal, act like clowns and all that, but there ain't gonna be that much k*lling.

Nah, k*lling comes from the heart, B.

Yeah. A damaged heart.

These people, they don't got that type of damage.

Do not participate! Do not purge!

Believe me. Do not participate!

Do not purge! Do not participate!

Do not purge! MAN: D!

You come to see the show?

OG.

All three of you old men out today?

What's the occasion? Am I...

Am I the luckiest man in the world?

Oh, man.

Look here.

This is the greatest sh*t show on Earth.

Are we gonna be the Christians or the lions?

Gladiators or the slaves, right?

(CHUCKLES)

Stay safe, Three.

If you need anything...

We three okay, man.

We done seen it all and then some.

We three, we've been through some sh*t.

DMITRI: Y'all be easy.

Hey, tough guy.

You here to participate or protest?

Still fighting the good fight, woman?

Fighting the only fight.

Oh, I see.

No cops, no law.



Sounds like a dream come true for a man in your business.

You got me wrong on this one, Ny.

I don't like it.

Why not?

I don't know what it is.

When I don't know exactly what something is...

I don't trust it.

Not one bit.

(DISTANT SIREN WAILING)

Keep it moving, man.

Hey, yo, pocket that money quick, son.

Hey, yo, clear out, yo!

Hey, yo, come on, Isaiah. Come on.

Come on. He cut me, man.

For real?

DMITRI: I called y'all here to discuss this experiment.



I don't give a sh*t what other people do during Purge night.

I care about what you all do.

You get hurt or you die, I lose money.

And I don't lose money. Word. Word.

And we got enemies, right? Yeah, true.

n*gg*s might use the night to make a move on us.

Maybe the police might use the night to take out m*therf*ckers like us.

Who knows?

Point is, we gotta be prepared for anything.

So we lay low.

We stay inside, and we protect what needs protecting. Word. - That's what's up.

Our kin, our skin, our product and our money.

Yo, D. We should all just go to Brooklyn.

You know what I mean? So we don't even take a chance.

Nah. Nah, we can't move our money or our stash off the island. It's too risky.

And it'll make us look weak. Come on, my G.

This is bullshit. I want to f*cking purge, man.

I want to tear sh*t up and have some f*cking fun.

I put food on your table.

Why don't I get the same type of discipline from your big a*s?

I'll stay home.

Yeah. I'm just showering, sis.

Did you hear what happened at Fourth and...

Isaiah, what's going on?

Why's there blood on the floor? Are you good?

(DOOR RATTLING) Yeah, I-I cut myself shaving.

You need facial hair in order to shave, boy.

Open up the door, or I'll kick it in.

You know I will. (DOOR RATTLING)

(ISAIAH SIGHS)

MAN: Keep your left up.

Get it out, get it out!

There you go.

Hey, hey!

MAN: It's all locked and loaded.

We're gonna have at least 20 soldiers surrounding this place, keeping it secure during the

experiment.

Me and Blaise will be at the stash house with about two dozen n*gg*s on the perimeter.

We'll be protected.

Yo, yo, yo. I don't believe you.

What is it? What's up?

Isaiah was just cut by some junkie off one of your corners.

What? Is he all right? He's going to be fine.

He didn't want to go to the hospital, 'cause he was too afraid I was going to find out he's been

hooking school, working the corner for the past week.

I had no idea he was involved, Nya.

Oh, bullshit. You think I know who works my corners? Nya, come on. Nya.

I would never let Isaiah get anywhere close to the business.

You know that.

I watched that boy grow up.

Why'd he... why'd he do it?



Why else?

He's sick of struggling.

He wanted to make life a little bit easier for us with some extra cash. And I told you I would give

you money for that. Stop.

I'll never take your blood money.

You know that.

I-I tried talking to him.

I tried... I tried being his mother, his father, his brother, his sister, but clearly, I'm not doing a

good enough job. Nya, Nya, hey.

Clearly, I can be... Hey, hey, hey, hey.

It's a'ight. I got you.

I want you to stay with me during the Purge, a'ight?

You and Isaiah.

As far as that... as far as that fiend who hurt your brother, I'm-a...

I'm-a take care of that, a'ight?

Take care of it?

Yeah.

What you gonna do?

You gonna hurt him, k*ll him? Ny, come on.

No, no, no, no. 'Cause that's your answer to everything.

Right? That's who you are.

Today, it was two people we know, but every day, it's at least two who are hurt 'cause of you, D.

I know no other way.

(SCOFFS) Come on.

I grew up here, too.



We all have to make choices in life to heal or to hurt, and you chose the latter.

(SIGHS) Don't you care about this Purge or what it could do to our community?

I mean...

More selfish bullshit.

Wow.

Now, the Purge is one day.

You, Dmitri, destroy this community 364 days a year.

You weren't always like this.

The man I knew and loved years ago had courage and had soul.

I miss that man.

But thank you for the invite.

I, uh, uh...

We're gonna be fine without you.

Oh. Uh, um...

Stay the f*ck away from us, Dmitri.

(DOOR OPENS)

(DOOR CLOSES)

WOMAN: And you're angry.

ISAIAH: Yes.

I'm angry.

Very angry.

You want to release that anger?

I need to.

Thank you for your honest answers.

First, a few formalities.

Baptisias, the official flower of the experiment.

They represent rebirth.

In the box, you have recording lenses.

Contacts.

Should you choose to actively participate, wear them on the evening, and they'll document

everything you do.

As I said, greater participation yields greater financial compensation.

Next, we'll implant a tracking device.

After that, you'll be all set, as they say... to purge.

MAN: What do you mean, I can't get off?

MAN #2: No, let me through!

(HORNS HONKING) Turn around. You gotta get out.

No. Let me off this island!

(HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING)

Why can't we just stay home?

I won't let anything happen, okay, mamita?

Hey. Oh, I didn't expect to see you.

I thought you would have left the island by now.

Oh, I was going to, but, you know, the money, Nya.

$5,000 to stay?

That's life-changing for us.

We need it. Yeah.

Pastor Almory opened up the church to everyone.

Mm-hmm. Okay? We got cots.

There's gonna be security at the door, food.

And Pastor's going to deliver a sermon later tonight.

DOLORES: Oh, Lord, forgive me.

Pastor's a wonderful man, but his sermons bore me to death.

It's a g*dd*mn snooze fest, okay?

(LAUGHTER) DOLORES: Yeah.

Why don't you make yourselves at home?

Anything you need. ALMORY: You'll be all right.

ANNOUNCER: CNB breaking news from Staten Island.

NEWS ANCHOR: This footage just came in.

It's being reported as the first k*ll or purge of the evening.

The following is graphic and contains violent images that might not be suitable for minors.

Selina.

Hey, come with me.

Help me with the other kids.

SELINA: There's something wrong with the world, isn't there, Nya?

There is something wrong, Selina.

But we have to keep trying to fix it.

MAN: (QUIETLY) Please, Jesus...

NEWS ANCHOR: This is very disturbing, but it is what we expected to see tonight.

It is very hard to process that... what we are looking at here is actually legal, that there is no

punishment for this inhumane act.

This is almost an alternate reality.

Where you gonna run to, Isaiah?

You can't run from me.

I'm the night, Isaiah.

I'm gonna find you.

UPDALE: It's starting.

The basic tenets of morality have to be abandoned.

Religious dogma must be dropped.

People are beginning to participate.

Don't get too excited.

NEWS ANCHOR: And to this point, we've seen mostly looting and vandalism, with only a few

instances of real v*olence across the island.

ANNE: Take, for example, the Park Hill Towers, the center of the community.

Many people are looking at them as a gauge of the Purge's success, but so far, it's been

relatively quiet.

SKELETOR: Where you gonna go?

I'm everywhere, Isaiah!

You can't hide from me!

I'm the king now.

And y'all are my queen.

So tell me, that b*tch-a*s n*gga beg for his life?

(g*ns c*ck)

DMITRI: Young king!

Your time is up now, A.

It was short.

Hope the crown felt good.

Yo, yo, D.

You thought that you could use their purge to take my a*s out, but...

Didn't anybody tell you, A?

I don't know how to die.

You can't purge me, man. I purge you.

In plain sight.

Yo, D.

Later, A.

f*ck you! (GASPING)

(DOGS BARKING IN DISTANCE)

Take care of these fools, man.

And let the girls walk.

But make sure that they know never to step foot on this island again.

(TWO g*nshots)

(DISTANT SCREAMING)

How accurate are these figures?

They were just updated, sir.

You predicted a much higher level of participation.

UPDALE: We should have expected the unexpected.

This is an experiment.

There are variables.

Variables? Human nature.

Behavioral patterns vary according to environment.

Data suggests that this socioeconomic group is not reacting the way that I predicted.

Question is: Why?

I don't give a sh*t why.

The NFFA put a lot of faith into this evening.

If it's deemed ineffective, the entire regime could be judged as a failure.

I told you that science does not obey the laws of politics.

My job is to analyze this data, nothing more.

(CELL PHONE BUZZING) Excuse me.

(SIGHS) I have to take this.

Yes, sir.

(DOOR OPENS)

Yes, sir, we're looking at the data right now.

We've gotta get to the church.

We'll be safe there.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER, DISTANT FOOTSTEPS RUNNING)

So?

What?

You lied to me, Isaiah.

(ISAIAH SCOFFS QUIETLY)

Almost got yourself k*lled.

(GLASS SHATTERING IN DISTANCE) Oh, are we gonna talk or what?

What do you want me to say?

That I'm wrong and I'm sorry?

That I learned my lesson tonight?

Or that I was just being plain-a*s stupid?

Yeah, that's what I want you to say.

I just said it.

I f*cking hate our apartment, Nya.

The leaks, roaches.

The fact that we never have anything for anything.

I don't like it, either, but there are other ways.

Are there?

'Cause I ain't seeing 'em.

I ain't seeing a way out, Nya.

(CLATTERING NEARBY)

When I was with Dmitri, I saw a lot of stupid sh*t.

People getting hooked.

Friends getting locked up.

I've been down this road before, and I saw a way out.

Just let me help you see it, too.

Deal?

Deal.

(MAN GRUNTS) Hey, yo, hey.

(LAUGHTER, WHOOPING)

(TYRES SQUEALING)

(MAN WHOOPS)

MAN: Yeah!

Where the hell did they come from?

We are seeing an interesting trend emerging tonight.

Some of the people participating in v*olence have been seen wearing masks and disguises.

The whole world is watching and wondering...

♫ When nighttime comes ♫

♫ I close my eyes ♫

♫ Uh-huh, when nighttime comes ♫

♫ When nighttime comes ♫

♫ I close my eyes ♫

♫ Uh-huh, when nighttime comes ♫

♫ When nighttime comes ♫

♫ Uh-huh ♫

♫ And I lower my crown ♫

♫ I close my eyes. ♫ ANNE: (OVER  TV) And psychologists are already speculating about why

they're doing this, why they're disguising their identities.



Is it that the participants are ashamed of this need, ashamed that they want to commit these

acts of v*olence?

Have you seen the chief? Or is the regalia just a chance for them to add ceremony and jubilee to

this night of lawlessness?

♫ Well, how 'bout the new generation? ♫

♫ How 'bout the new elevation? ♫

♫ What you gonna do when you make it? ♫

♫ Hop out the Lamb, then I skated ♫

You want me to try to find some new girls to bring up to your office tonight?

Oh, sh*t.

TECH: A large group of people are participating on Main and Third.

g*ng activity across the island on multiple screens.

Participation levels increasing.

Increasing v*olence on various screens.

Purgers everywhere, especially in low-income areas.

All data supported early violent behavior and then a downturn.

This doesn't make any sense.

Where are these gangs coming from?

Why weren't they out earlier?

NEWS ANCHOR: Islanders are now taking to the streets as we are witnessing waves of v*olence all

across the borough.

ANNE: The governor is sending 500 state troopers tomorrow...

Don't question it.

This is a good thing for both of us.

ISAIAH: (WHISPERING) Nya, we can't go...

(GASPING) LUISA: Nya!

Sorry, sorry. It's okay, it's okay.

It's us. Jesus Christ.

You scared the sh*t out of me.

Are you okay?

What the hell happened in there?

(CRYING) b*stards went inside.

About a dozen of them started sh**ting at everyone.

We had to pretend we were dead.

We covered ourselves in somebody else's blood.

I'm so glad you're okay.

D-Dolores. Dolores.

Where's Dolores? Have you seen her?

We don't know. We don't know where she is.

She left earlier. She went looking for you.

Isaiah, try Dolores's cell. See if you can find her.

No, no. No.

LUISA & SELINA: No!

Some people got out, Nya.

But not everyone.

ISAIAH: Nya.

Her phone's off. (RAPID g*nf*re NEARBY)

They badasses for hire.

They'll work for anyone anywhere as long as the cash is correct.

Like Blackwater back in the days.

Usually ex-military, and not just American.

These f*ckers are the real deal.

Show me Park and Fourth ten minutes ago.

(TYPING)

Here.

UPDALE: Follow those trucks backwards.

Use drones, street cams, whatever you need access to, to see where the hell they came from.

SABIAN: There's purging going on all over the city.

It's turning.

I knew it would. MAN: Sir.

We have a breach inside a private office.

I tracked those trucks all the way across the island to here: a remote area of abandoned

factories.

Watch this now.

At around midnight, something strange happens.

I did a vehicle search on all systems, and every one of these vehicles ended up in Park Hill,

Mariners Harbor and Stapleton.

The low-income areas of the island.

And they're attacking crowded places: churches, apartment buildings, Purge parties.

The gangs know where people are gathering because of the tracking implants.



How would gangs know how to monitor the tracking implants?

They're not gangs.

I want all this footage on a flash drive.

SABIAN: Did you really think you could just snoop around an NFFA building? I know what

you're doing.

You're sending soldiers into the island disguised as gangs, as citizens, hunting people down

using the tracking implants.

You're making it look like people are participating because there wasn't enough purging.

But they're not soldiers.

They're mercenaries from all over.

This country is overpopulated, Doctor.

There's too much crime, too much unemployment... Is that even true, or did you falsify those

numbers, too? And a bankrupt government that can't afford to care for its own citizenry.

People don't want us to raise taxes?

Our debt has tripled. We can't pay for anything.

We, the NFFA... we inherited all this mess.

All right, something needed to be done.

Not like this. Well, what then?

You tell me, because we exhausted every possibility.

I need for this to work.

I need to sell this on a country-wide scale because this is our last hope.

You're trying to depopulate the lower classes just so the NFFA doesn't have to support them.

Come on.

We both know there's... there's no easy answer where somebody... some group doesn't suffer.

What have I done?

You saved us.

I thank you for it.

No. No.

Don't-don't do this.

The American people don't need this.

Do not build this on a lie. I'm terribly sorry.

I was wrong. The NFFA and America will remember you fondly as a hero to your nation.

It's like C-4 with a handheld detonator.

NFFA been putting all this sh*t in the streets, y'all, hoping that we'd off each other.

We didn't, and now they're stoking the fire in another m*therf*cking way.

Our neighborhood is under siege, gentlemen, from a government who doesn't give a sh*t about

any of us.

Now, there's a lot of good people out there who we're gonna have to protect now.
