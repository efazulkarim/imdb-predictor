CARL:

Are you ready?

(TICKING CONTINUES)

We're ready.

Ready to forget,

once and for all.

Good, Mr. Lambert.

So then, close your eyes.

Both of you.

Now take a deep breath.

Now feel yourselves

getting sleepier and sleepier.

Neither of you will remember

the last year.

There is no place called

The Further.

You will only remember

Dalton's coma.

And his recovery.

And let the darkness drift

further and further away.

(TICKING SLOWS, STOPS)

DALTON:

"For everything,

there is a season.

"A time to be born

"and a time to die.

"A time to k*ll

"and a time to heal.

"A time to keep

"and a time to throw away.

"A time to weep

"and a time to laugh.

"A time to mourn

and a time to dance.

"A time for silence...

"...and a time to speak.

"A time for love

and a time to hate.

A time for w*r

and a time for peace."

Amen.

Amen.

We therefore commit

this body to the ground.

He's just anxious

about leaving.

For school next week.

I know. Yeah, uh-huh.

Um...

Thank you

for organizing all this.

I just haven't had

the bandwidth.

Why don't you drive him

You have a few weeks until all

Nah, he-he-he wouldn't

want me to.

He's not the parent. You are.

When I was ten,

my parents died,

with my Grandma Perkee,

who once went

almost nearly blind

of athlete's foot.

I don't remember

when I was ten.

Like, the whole year.

What do you mean?

I was in a coma.

Viral meningitis.

At least

that's what they told me

the few times

that they would talk about it.

But I don't remember anything.

I don't even remember

being sick.

It's like I woke up one day

and a whole year had passed.

That's awful.

And pretty weird.

Well done.

Yeah, honestly,

I wish I could have forgotten

a whole year when I was a kid.

Could've used

a little meningi-gi.

Uh, you know, there-there is

one more weird thing about me.

Um, ever since my coma,

I've...

I've been afraid

of th-the dark.

I was afraid of Barbie dolls

till I was, like... now.

There's nothing wrong

with being scared.

you don't keep me up

Something that could

explain this... fog.

you're talking about,

they could be spurred on

Increased stress,

change in daily habits.

Have there been any disruptions

in your home life?

passed away recently.

I'm sorry for your loss.

my son left for school,

sounds stressful.

Yeah.

Maybe a grief counselor

could be of some help.

Yeah. Sure. Probably would.

Do you have any history of

mental illness in your family?

Mental illness?

It's nothing to be

alarmed about.

It can be informative

as we try to make a diagnosis.

Not that I'm aware of.

It's worth looking into.

Meanwhile,

there are exercises,

games you can do

to stimulate your memory.

Matching games,

like-like-like kids do.

You want me to play

ARMAGAN (VOICE-OVER):

Chiaroscuro.

(PROJECTOR CLICKS)

The dance of light and shadow.

An effect used not only

to create volume and definition

but also a specific,

unseen light source.

Right.

This is one of Goya's best.

The negative space

draws our eyes towards Saturn.

Does it represent darkness

or some void?

Goya mastered it on the canvas,

but family problems

and health issues...

YOUNG DALTON: Please, Daddy.

...sent this once revered

court painter

into a dark spiral,

leading him to create

this grisly portrait

of a father devouring his son.

FOSTER (OVER PHONE):

'Sup, nerd?

A red  door.

A purple pecker.

Come on, man. Doesn't that

mean anything to you?

A red door?

You sound weirder than usual.

It's a thing from art class.

It's a painting.

We had to find a memory.

I thought it was something

from our childhood.

Did you ask Mom?

No, I don't want to worry her.

Why would that worry her?

I don't know.

Is this what happens

when you go to college?

You get all cryptic and sh*t?

I guess.

Well, I'm not going, then.

(DEEP CREAKING)

(GASPS)

So, after the whole spooky

dream-not-a-dream thing

the other night,

I started thinking,

"Yeah, okay, Dalton's a weirdo,

but he's not insane, right?"

I'm gonna need that key back.

Right.

So, I started poking around

the old interwebs,

and guess what.

You're not crazy at all.

You are an astral projector.

Check this out.

Looks like they filmed it

in between shifts at Best Buy.

Hey, guys,

this is "Spectral Sightings."

I'm Specs.

This is Tucker.

Say hi, Tucker.

No.

Okay. We are PPI, Professional

Paranormal Investigators.

Today, we're gonna be

talking about something

that dozens of you

have been asking us about.

(ECHOING)

Astral projection.

SPECS:

It's a real phenomenon.

Our physical body falls asleep,

and our astral body

leaves that physical body and

floats off into another realm.

That's exactly

what it feels like.

See, I told you.

It's cool, right?

Our former mentor,

Dr. Elise Rainier,

she had a name

for this other realm.

(DISTORTED)

She called it The Further.

Hold on.

ELISE (OVER COMPUTER):

I am Elise.

It's nice to see you all.

So, I'm here to talk to you

about astral projection

and The Further.

Okay.

Give me a minute here.

Three,

two,

one.

The Further is a dark realm

filled with tortured souls

of the dead,

and some are doomed

to live the worst mistakes

of their lives

over and over and over

for all eternity.

When you astral project

or you travel to this realm,

these are the souls that

you awaken with your presence.

They can smell you.

The presence of life.

Life is what they crave

more than anything,

so the further you travel,

the riskier

the journey becomes.

They want life, and they can

come to our world to get it.

Keep a steady stride.

(KEYBOARD CLICKS)

Oh, I see those gears turning.

What is it?

That kid from the frat house?

The pukey kid?

Yeah.

He said something to me.

He said, "Close the door."

I'm sure he did. It probably

wasn't his proudest moment.

Yeah, but what if

he meant something else?

What if he was

talking about this door?

So, what,

you want to go back and ask him?

(CHUCKLES)

Seriously?

I need to know.

I-I feel bad for the dude,

I do, but...

dark realms are typically

places I try to avoid.

There's something...

important about

this painting, Chris.

I have to find out.

Okay.

But it's not like Nick the d*ck

is just gonna let you

waltz into his bedroom and chat

with the ghost in his toilet.

(CHUCKLES)

He'll never know I'm there.

(LIVELY CHATTER, LAUGHTER)

(QUIETLY)

So, what's the plan?

I got this.

WOMAN: Can I help you?

( TV PLAYING QUIETLY)

(BRITISH ACCENT)

Hello.

I have left my brassiere

in Nicholas's room,

and I was wondering

if he is perchance home?

I think he's upstairs

studying with Paige.

(CHUCKLES)

Great job, Dolphin.

NICK:

So, I'm gonna read you this.

It's called "In Flames."

Very vulnerable piece.

"Looking across a campfire,

"they say it's beautiful.

But without you

on the other side..."

I need a room with darkness.

Okay.

Then what?

You gonna float through the air

and do a little, "Ooh"?

(CHUCKLES)

I'm not, like, a ghost.

And you never will be

with that attitude, Casper.

(DOOR OPENS)

Bingo.

What are the chances

those bedsheets are crusty?

Probably snap

like a taco shell.

I'll take the dirty floor.

CHRIS (WHISPERS):

Okay.

give me a little space?

Oh, yeah. Sorry.

Wow, two calls in one week.

Come on, man.

Haven't you made

Tell me everything you remember

about my coma.

You should talk to Mom.

I-I think these-these things

I-I'm drawing, they-they...

The door?

And now a guy with a hammer.

A hammer?

I-I think they could be

clues from my past,

thoughts that have disappeared

'cause of my coma.

I don't know why

that they're coming out now,

but they are, and I...

Wait. Dalton.

What is it?

I've had this image

in my mind for years.

Mom always says it's not real,

it's just a bad dream, but...

Tell me, little brother.

Come on.

Okay.

We're in a room somewhere.

You were. You are, Josh.

(SCOFFS)

Well, Dalton would disagree.

Well, uh,

if it's any consolation,

I can't even get him

to call me back.

(SIGHS)

My dad abandoned his family,

and I've done the same thing.

No, you haven't.

You're not him, Josh,

and you're allowed

to be angry at him.

I am angry.

I've been angry

for a long time,

angry at a man

that I have never met.

Angry at a man

that jumped off the roof

of a mental hospital

in 1978.

For more than 40 years,

that man has been dead and gone.

My dad. Ben Burton.

So how in the hell is

he terrorizing me here, now,

in the real world?

He attacked me

at Mom's place...

He attacked you?

Yeah.

So-so am I just crazy or...

I don't know.

He, uh...

(CLEARS THROAT)

...left this for my mom

the day he died.

What ends with him?

Josh...

Is-is that the answer?

Am I just crazy?

Is his madness inside of me?

And is that why I've been

so lost the past few years?

I mean, did I pass this curse

on to our kids?

I mean, is he gonna haunt them

like he haunted me?

Josh. Josh. Josh.

I mean, why didn't my mother

say anything about this?

Stop. Stop. Stop.

You're not crazy.

You're not crazy.

Then what's happening to me?

Dalton.

So Dalton and I could travel

to some other...

...dimension,

where we were haunted

by ghosts and goblins.

RENAI:

More like entities,

like the one in those photos

that haunted you.

And your father,

he saw them, too,

and maybe

he's just reaching out.

Back then, he told your mom.

She didn't understand.

She-she didn't know

how to help him.

Oh, help him

like you helped us?

By suppressing our memories?

We all thought it was for

the best, Josh, you included.

But you got foggy.

The suppression,

it-it slowed you down.

And your mom and I,

we didn't know what to do,

and I was too scared

to tell you the truth.

Dalton was right.

(SIGHS)

He said my mom had secrets,

that she was hiding something

from us.

I just never thought

you did, too.

For ten years...

You have no idea how hard

it has been for me.

For ten years,

you kept this away from me. Why?

Honestly, you don't know.

Just why? Why? Why?!

Please. You don't understand.

Because you tried

to k*ll our family!

You chased us around the house

with a g*dd*mn baseball bat!

What?

I mean, I knew

that it wasn't you.

I knew it was that thing

in those photos.

But the kids?

They don't understand.

All those night terrors

that Foster had.

I've been lying to our children

for a decade,

telling them

those memories aren't real.

"They're just your imagination.

Dad's not gonna hurt you."

I couldn't.

But you did.

Doesn't matter to them

what was controlling you.

What they saw was your face.

It was you who was

causing all that pain.

That's why I pulled away.

I just...

I couldn't live

like that anymore.

You know...

...we could've gotten

through this together.

Is this you?

Dalton just sent this to me.

He's been having nightmares

and visions.

Something about a red  door.

And now this.

What do we do?

Stay

Stay with me

In the darkness

You must only think of me

There can be no in between

When your pride

I'll make you

Beg for more

Stay with me

You'd better hope and pray

That you'll make it safe

back to your own world

You'd better hope and pray

That you'll wake one day

in your own world

'Cause when you sleep

at night

They don't hear your cries

in your own world

Only time will tell

if you can break the spell

Back in your own world
