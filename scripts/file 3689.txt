Wow! Hey! What are you doing? 
You're going to the frat party? 
- Where did he go? 
- Move gentleman, away! 
What's your problem? 
- Problem again? 
- I'm in trouble still. 
You should use some of your 
movements in your game, Jack. 
- kick some butt. - It ain't those gaming world Mr. Chang, this is real world. One's get nothing to do with the other. - Bravery is bravery. 
- Look at me. 
Do I.. Do I even look like I 
have one awesome brave in me? 
Looking and being are 2 
different things, young Jack. 
On this case.. Here what 
you see is what you get. 
Well, let's see if I can get 
some work out of my employee. 
Yeah okay. 
How are thing at home? 
Moms worried about money. Real estate markets dead. She hasn't sold anything in months. Looks like we're gonna have to move. Wish I could do 
something to help her out. 
Medical app or something? 
What's all this? 
The new shipment from my cousin 
in Beijing. Help me open it. 
- Mr. Chang what's this? 
- It has been in my family since.. Forever. - You like it? 
- Yeah I do. 
- The dancing princess. 
- Yeah looks like she's breaking. 
- You know, like.. 
- Oh God.. 
See look? 
I don't think so young Jack. 
She lived a long.. Long.. Time ago. Page 4/36

She saved a country from the barbarians. Talk about brave, she was brave. This little girl can kick butt big time. Where do I put it? 
- How about your house? 
- What do you mean? 
I mean.. A present.. 
- No Mr. Chang.. I can't.. I can't.. - Oh sure you can. 
You watch the shop while 
I going on vacations. 
- Oh but you already paying me for that. - Bad manners to refuse a gift. - Thank you. 
- You're welcome. 
- Hey so I have an idea. 
- What? 
This house.. Really kinda 
too big for both of us. 
I mean when dad was here 
itwas fine. But now.. 
You know.. Maybe we should think about renting our room hall. 
To that some kid from 
university or something. 
What did I do to deserve a kid like you? On the lottery? 
Night. 
- Where is the Black knight? 
- What? 
Hey! 
Where is the Black knight? 
- I.. I'm the Black knight. 
- You lie! You die! 
Black knight, it's Octo Man. 
- Hey wait, wait. 
- I'll challenge you to a duel to death. It is a video game! It's a video game! Okay? I just.. I just 
want to show you man. 
I'm 8 arms now bro. 
Okay you see that's the challenger and that's me, the Black knight. It is true.. 
Page 5/36
Yeah it's me, hey look when I move.. He moves. 
Fight! 
- You are the winner. - Just you wait man, when I'm comeback with 12 arms. 
- So you are the Black knight. 
- In the game world, I'm the Black knight. In this world I'm Jack Bronson. 
Jack Bronson worthless to me. 
But I don't have a choice. 
Jack Bronson, I need your help. 
- Forwhat? - I need you to guard the most precious treasure of the empire. Excuse me? 
Your majesty, you can go out. 
The princess and future empress. Hi, I'm Jack. 
Anyone who touches the 
princess dies. That is the rule. No exceptions? 
There's no point in having 
rule if you have exception. 
Sometimes is good to 
be a little flexible. 
It's useless. 
But I don't have a choice. 
I'll be back as soon as possible. If anything happens to her.. 
I'm hallucinating, this is crazy, this isn't happening, this isn't happening. - Where are yourweapons? 
- My weapons? 
Warrior Zhao said you 
were going to protect me. 
To protect me you need to 
have skills and weapons. 
Hey you know, I.. I think Warrior Zhao a little confuse because.. 
I'm not the Black knight. 
I don't have skills orweapons. 
So Warrior Zhao was 
right, you are worthless. 
Okay you know what? Can 
we start over? I'm Jack.. 
Page 6/36
- What do I call you? 
- Your highness. 
- I need a name. 
- Sulin. 
- Okay.

Roasted snail, the big kind. 
Oh and duck tongue in hot chilli sauce. Let's see what I can do. 
Not bad. 
Su lin? 
No, no, no, no. 
Hey, just in time. 
Hey, how's your sleep? 
Great, how did your sleep? 
Good. 
- Do want to sit down? 
- Umm, no, no. 
Because I read that it's better for your digestion if you're standing. I never heard it. 
Okay, I'll do the dishes. 
No, no, I'll do it mom, I do 
it mom, I'll do dishes today. 
Excuse me, what? 
You have to go to work, the bridge's down, this traffic, you can be late. - The bridge? - Yeah. No, you gotta go, you're gonna be late.

- Got it, please... ok.

Well, pound it up, your highness. 
No! 
Oh dude, I am so sorry. 
I am sorry, you ok? 
Yeah, it's cool man, I 
kinda worry, you know. 
So what's the story here? 
It's complicated, I don't really 
want talk about it right now. 
- You know what I mean. 
- Dude, the girl is hot. 
- You're gonna hook up? 
- No, if you keep ask.. 
me stupid questions like that. 
You tell me all about that, right? 
- Until the last detail. 
- Right, catch you two lovebirds later. You can't do that! 
- He want to hit me. - No, he want 
to fistbump you! 
It's a greeting like a handshake. 
Didn't you hear Warrior Zhao? No touch up princess, they can make your heap chopped off. - That's the rule. 
- Ok, maybe where you come from.. 
that's the rule, but here, 
here the rules are different. 
When you go back to yourworld, you can chop off as many heads as you want, I promise. But here, my world my rule, ok? 
Ok. 
No! 
- What are you doing? 
- Observing yourworld, 
Page 8/36

So I can learn the rules better. 
No, no, no, you have to go back inside. How am I gonna to learn rules 
of yourworld if I don't see it? 
Well you can go out dressed like that. - Why not? 
- Because.. 
Because, they will stare and 
wonderwhat the hell is going on. 
If I were dressed differently 
could I stand here? 
- Yes. - Then call the tailor and 
have him.. 
- make me new cloth. - We don't 
get our clothes from the tailor. 
Then take me where you do. 
This for man. 
- You okay? 
- What's that? 
- That's Ice cream, it's food. 
- What that feels like? 
Well, it's cold and sweet. 
I want one. 
Ok what flavor do you want? They have chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, cherry and mint.. Umm, I want all of them. 
All of them? 
Ok. 
Ok. 
- Girl, you're the shit. 
- Hey hey, it's your ice cream. 
- Yeah, we gotta go. 
- Thatwas fun. 
- Yeah, really? - I like them all, Jack, thank you for bringing me here. 
You're welcome. 
What do you mean I'm the shit? 
When you really like 
something, that's whatwe say. 
Hey mom. 
- Hello. 
- I ate Ice cream. 
Yeah, I can see that. 
Mom, I forget to tell you. Yesterday in Page 9/36

school they asked someone to volunteer.. to take an exchange student, and... 
- Sulin showed up today. 
- Oh you fresh out of the boat. 
No boat, I came by box. 
- What? 
- Oh she meant plane. 
Plane, because box and plane 
are the same in her language. 
What's the plane? 
- She does it all the time. 
- I thought she just gotten here. 
- She did. 
- But you just said all the time. 
I did, I meant that in 
the time she's been here. 
- Are you ok with this? 
- Yeah, I mean.. 
- No, no, no. 
- Sulin, it's so nice to meet you. 
I am Jack's mom, I am Annie. 
I am so hungry. 
I am sure we have salad, 
fresh corn and.. hamburger. 
Sulin do you like Hamburgers? 
I like snails, like Jack and me last night. Last night? 
The Chinese grammar, they get their 
past and future tenses mixed up alot. You know you're acting very weird. 
Why don't you put the burgers on? 
Su lin and I will go make up the 
couch and the guess room for her. 
I'm gonna gone tomorrow but maybe when I get back we can sketch to know each other little better? Maybe we can go to the mall, it's the shit. - Who told you that? 
- Jack. 
Umm, this is where you gonna be sleeping. - She said that? 
- To my mom. 
- That is ill dude. 
- Hector, give me a break. 
I don't know, man, the girl is 
Page 10/36
hot. Things I would do to her.. 
Good night Hector. 
Excuse me, the bed next door 
is in the wrong position. 
Very bad Feng Shui, I can't sleep. 
This one good Feng Shui. 
Don't forget to clean the house. 
Oh don'tworry, you won't 
recognize the place when get back. 
- Say Hi to aunt Sophie. 
- Sure. 
- Where is she? 
- Who the hell are you? 
- Where is the princess? 
- Listen man, I don't know, ok? 
I am here. 
No, no, no! 
Jack! Jack! 
Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack! 
Ok, I told you not to let 
her outta of your sight. 
- You worthless! 
- I am not a warrior! 
I don't know what you're expecting. 
I was expecting more. 
Ok, well how about this for more, 
when I saw she was taken by those.. 
Whatever the hell those I jumped 
in and after them, man, ok? 
What more do you want? And by the way, we came the same way seconds apart, she should be here. - She's not. 
- Well where is she then? 
- I don't know. - How you could not know? I was right behind her. 
I was busy! 
Maybe she came in and ran 
out. She probably outside. 
Wait, don't! 
Oops. 
Ok, ok. 
I don'twant you to think 
I am backing out on you, 
but it's not, you know, I 
Page 11/36

got a lot ofhomework to do.. 
so I should getting back by now, just go back to where I came. 
It's not gonna happen. 
So I am stuck here, 
there's no otherway out? 
I didn't say that. 
- I am not in charge of transportation. - Well who is? 
- The wizard it is. 
- And where's the wizard? 
Jack Bronson, I won't do that. 
- Wake up! - Stop! Never 
wake a sleeping wizard. 
What? I'll get my head chopped off? Yes, how did you know? 
Lucky guess. What is itwith you people chopping offheads? I mean, really. It's effective. 
Close the door! 
Cut the rope! 
Get behind me! 
Open the door. 
There's like thousands of.. 
Just open it. 
Ok. 
Sorry. Hello, what is 
your name, young man? 
- Jack. 
- Oh Jack, welcome Jack. 
Is something wrong? 
No, you just look a 
lot like someone I know. 
Is he handsome? 
Yes. 
ok, now let's go find the princess. - Can you explain something to me? - If I can. 
- Well let's startwith the chest. - The Warrior's gate. 
- That's the real name. 
- And how does itwork? 
That's complicated. 
It has to do with times, spaces, magic.. Page 12/36

and things beyond explaining. 
The main thing is that it's works. - Then how do I get back. 
- Another chest. 
There's another chest? 
Great, where is it? 
Well, that is complicated. I have to collect four differentwoods.. from 4 different trees that grow in four different parts of the country. North where the Zippa wood is found. South where the spotted bamboo grows. Eastwhere the black mahogany lives. And westwhere the rarest 
tree in all the land is found. That's the only way to build a new box. But first let's find the Princess. You know where she is? 
Another complicated question. 
How about an easy one, huh? 
Zhao. Tell me about Zhao. 
That's easy. 
Warrior Zhao was one of 
the seven companions.. 
raised from birth by the sacred monks.. for one thing and one thing only. To protect the emperor. 
The monks train the 7 
companions day and night, 
year in and year out, until they would be most invincible force. Itwas their sole purpose in 
life to protect the emperor.. 
while brought peace to the land. There was not a man alive 
who could defeat them. 
Except one. 
Arun the cruel, king ofbarbarian. As fate would have it. Zhao was on the mission and they figure it out. The food has been poisoned. 
Feeling the worse. 
He rush to protect the emperor. But he arrived too late. 
Page 13/36
And then chaos decendent from the door. And the peace that emperor had work so hard to built began to fall apart. With no leader the army was lost. 
The people were lost. 
The Zhao fought relentesly but 
as great as warrior as he was. 
He needed a help of the greatest 
warrior that could be found. 
And so, by using the cynic stone. 
I found you. 
Yes. 
And we pass to the warriors gate to get help protecting the greatest treasure we possessed. - Shuman? 
- Sulin. 
The only one who can rally 
the people to defeat. 
The Barbarians and save our kingdoms. But I'm not be able to help him. 
He thinks I am worthless. 
Oh, you seems might. But I don't. 
- Based on what? 
- You're here. You didn't have to be. You could've stay at home. 
That's something aboutwho you are. 
Am I crazy? 
And now if you will excuse me. 
I have a lot of wood to collect. 
See you. Bye-bye. 
Come on, let's go. 
You know the old saying about 
blaming the burial is bad news. 
Yes, your highness. 
- You believe it's true? 
- I hope not, your highness. 
Good news, you're getting marry. Bad news. Warrior Zhao is on his way. 
kill him. 
Brutus, not him, kill Zhao. 
Ups. 
- So, I assumed you have a plan. 
- I do. Save the princess. 
Prevent the married. 
Page 14/36
Oh? She is getting married? 
Force to. Unless we stop it. 
- Ah.. Who is the groom? 
- Arun the Cruel. 
Ah, is it his name? 
His full name is Arum the cruel, 
the horrible, the terrible, the miserable. Butwe keep it short. 
If the marry takes place.. 
Once she become empress, he become emperor. And once he is an emperor. He will kill her and the whole country is doom. 
Are you finish with dinner? 
- I guess. 
- Yeah, we sleep. 
I know, I know, we are rafting it but do we have any, blankets and pillows? Blankets? No. 
Pillows. Yes. 
Good night. 
Let say you have rescue the princess. - Is she have anyone else might to marry? - Not yet. 
Any idea what kind husband she looking for? Cause in the little time we 
spend together, you know what? 
I thoughtwe have something. 
You know, connection. 
Cause we like the same clothes, 
we like the same musics. 
- You know, you don't think that.. - No, I don't think, Jack Bronson. She's looking for someone good, 
someone brave, a hero. 
Yeah. 
Sized in the right of 
capital of Chunghai province. 
1.600 bricks of silver, 18.000 
bricks of gold. 6 chests of diamonds. And 26 slaves. 
- Only 26 slaves? 
- Yes, I know. 
We're under performing 
in that departement. 
Page 15/36
Who is incharge of slaves? 
My cousin. 
Get rid ofhim. 
Brutus, I mean the cousin. 
Not him! 
Ups. 
A second moment here, big fella. Now, I know you want to please me, but next time.. 
Before you kill someone. 
Should we have a signal, maybe? Like, something like that? Like, signal? Like that? A signal like that? 
- Like that? Yes. 
- kill. That's the signal. 
- Yes. 
- That's the signal. 
Your highness. 
- Get her down. 
- Finally. 
Beautiful bride has arrive. 
Hello, my love. 
How are you? Tired from your long trip. - Need a hot bath? 
- Stay there! 
- A hunk of milk, maybe? 
- Hold! 
Soon, my love. Soon. 
You and me. 
Let's move! 
You and me! 
- Go! Go! 
- Call the tailor for fitting! 
- What are you doing? 
- It's gonna rain. 
There's no cloud. 
Not all rain come from cloud. 
Oh my God! 
Oh my God! Look at this! 
What the hell is going on? 
He wants me dead. 
- So they know we are here? 
- They know we're somewhere around here. So they're just keep shooting arrows 
Page 16/36
everywhere and hope to get lucky. We called it the morning shower. Why don't you wake me up? 
I could been dead. 
If I want you dead, I will do it myself. You have to learn to listen. 
- What is said? 
- Do not enter. 
- And what's in there? 
- The unknown land. 
- What is in the unknown land? 
- Unknown things. 
Okay, wait, but.. You are drop 
me off to the wizard, right? 
- Wrong. 
- Okay, look, I really think.. 
Is about time we thought 
about getting me home? 
- So do I. Here. 
- What is this? 
A map. Itwill take you to the wizard. I.. I can't read this. I justwant to go home and you are not helping. - I gave you a map. 
- So basicly it's screw you, Jack. I brought you here against yourwill, I kidnapped you, 
and now you're not the 
person I though you were. 
So, adios amigo. You are not my problem. Wrong at number one. 
I did not kidnap you. 
No one need you jump into that chest. Right on number two. 
You are not my problem. 
My problem is to get 
through the unknown land. 
Get pass the Arum's army. 
Pass his personal guards. 
Pass the terror guards. 
Find the princess, 
get pass the Torror's reinforcement. Pass the personal guard's reinforcement. kill Arum. 
Page 17/36
And then bring the princess back so she can be made empress who save the country. That is my problem. 
So you're saying I don't have a choice. You do have a choice. 
You can save yourself or you can save her. - I can't save a princess! 
- You are the black knight. 
- Oh, yeah, I almost forgot. 
- Sir, sir.. 
Sir.. 
Good news. 
Don't be nervous. 
It's been my lucky days so far. 
- And I've good feeling about this one. - Yes, sire. 
I'm sure, it's good news. 
Bad news. 
- No, impossible.. 
- No sign of warrior Zhao. 
Sire... Sire.. 
Brutus.. 
No, no.. 
- Signal, you remember, the signal? - Signal? 
- kill him! 
- No, no, no, no! 
Sire! Sire! 
I was thinking. This Arum dude, maybe ifhe gets what he want, he'll change, you know. Be like Arum the kind? 
Do you have people in yourworld who getwhat they want by threating to do bad things? At least there is one kid. 
And you give him what he wants. 
Does he change? 
Not really. 
Might does not make right, Jack. 
Right makes right. 
If you don't stand up forwhat is right, and why you stand up at all? 
You know, that's easy to say. 
This, this kid, he is bigger then me. He's stronger then me. 
Page 18/36
So what do you do? 
- I run. 
- Is that solve your problem? 
No. 
- So you got a girl? 
- No.

and cold in the same time and... 
Your heart is beating like you just run a mile in a minute... And it's.. It's like.. Magic? 
Yeah, I guess. 
Help! 
Help!

Wait... you're... you're twins? No, we are not. 
We're triplets. 
And you our... 
Dinner! 
Come on, let me down! 
Zhao! Zhao! Zhao! 
Zhao! 
Help! 
Zhao! 
Zhao! 
Aw! He's a cute one. 
Cute one always taste better. 
Oh, no. The fat ones taste better. The fat ones give me dash. 
If you let the blood 
out, he'll cooked faster. 
No! No! No! 
Get away from him! 
Help! 
Help! 
Help! 
Zhao! 
Hey, since it seems we're in 
trouble every 20 minutes... 
maybe it could be good if 
you showed me a few moves. 
Just in case. 
Martial arts take many years to learn. No, I'm not asking for the whole menu. Just a little something. 
Martial arts do notwork 
with a little something. 
Well then, a lot of something. Anything. Even if I can do one thing to help out the next time we're in a situation. Just give me something so 
I have a fighting chance. 
Please. 
Come on. 
Come on. 
Get up. 
Stand a feet apart. 
Oh, this is cool. 
Page 22/36
Bend your knees. 
Sorry. 
Okay. 
Now imagine... there's a 
big tree in front of you. 
Do you see it? 
Yeah. 
Is it big? 
Yeah. 
Okay. 
Now, hug it. 
Do what? 
I mean hug the tree. 
Good. 
- That's it? 
- That's it. 
Well, how long do I 
have to stay like this? 
You know if you're not gonna 
teach me, you should just say so. I am teaching you. 
Yeah. Right. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Hey. Hey, wait. 
What are you doing? 
Come on. 
Now, pay attention. 
The secret of all martial 
arts is the circle. 
When you moved, the 
circle moves with you. 
Here, let me show you. 
Hit me. 
Hit me again. 
Again. 
To understand the circle, 
you must make the circle... 
live the circle, now, 
the circle is you.. 
and you are the circle. 
Understand? 
We move the moment she says "I do". First on me. 
Directly for the capital. 
Second army. 
Page 23/36
To the ocean. 
And the third army? 
We have a third army? 
Yes. 
Just let them robbing village. Excuse me, sir. 
For the wedding canopy. 
Red or blue? 
Red or blue, my love? 
Oops. 
And this is called not good. 
Why, it's beautiful? 
Yes, it is. But the 
fortress is over there. 
And it could take days to walk all the way around the lake. 
Orwe could just swim across in no time. No, Jack. It's not possible. 
Why, are there 
man-eating fish in there? 
No. 
- Poisonous snakes? 
- Nope. 
- Dragons? 
- Not this time of year. 
So, what's in it that's a problem? I cannot swim. 
You kidding me? 
You... you who can kick the butts of the entire NFL at the same time... and you can't swim, what's 
wrong with this picture? 
They never taught... 
Yeah. Oh, come on. Where you're going? There's no time to waste. 
You're gonna walk? 
We don't have a choice. 
Okay, you gotta get over this "you don't have a choice" thing, alright? You do have a choice. 
You're strong and you're coordinated. Alright, maybe, we can 
work something else, okay? 
I teach you to swim, 
Page 24/36
you teach me more... 
Deal? 
Come on. 
Ooh... 
You can do it. 
You can do it, come on. 
Trust me. 
Hey, that's it. 
There you go. 
Now, put the shield on. 
Now, hop on. 
- Ooh... 
- Hey. 
There you go. 
You having fun? 
Yeah. 
I bet you didn't get too much of that, growing up the way you did. Fun? No. 
So, if you can make up for that... maybe you can come visit me. 
I'll show you around, maybe get my Mom to take us to Disneyland or something. I told you. 
I can never take off from my job. Hey, man, look... you... 
you really got to get a life. 
When you're responsible for 
a life, you don't have a life. 
Okay. 
You... 
You like go to school to 
learn how say things like that? Like what? 
When you're responsible for 
a life, you don't have a life. 
What's wrong with it? 
Nothing is wrong, but that, it's just... sound smart. 
It does? 
Yeah, it does. 
Cool. 
So, what's in Disneyland? 
A lot of princesses. 
Page 25/36
Oh. 
- A Chinese one, too. 
- Oh. 
- Our king will win! 
- Our king will win! 
Get down, get down, get down! 
So, you... you do have a plan, right? I've told you the plan. 
Ah, right. Get past the army. 
- Yes. 
- Get past the personal guards. 
- Correct. 
- Get past the tower guards. Find the princess. - Get past reinforcements? 
- Good.

- Exactly. 
Crowned Sulin in person 
saved the country. 
You learning to listen. 
Yeah. 
The real questions is... 
Do you have a plan to 
execute... the plan? 
Hmm? 
Ah, I mean... 
- Who will win? 
- Our king will win! 
Our king will win! 
Good morning. 
Hmm? 
Great plan. 
- Are we in the fortress? 
- Yeah. 
- Are we passed the army? 
- Yeah. 
Have we passed the personal guards? 
Almost. 
Well then, I think the plan is working. I think the plan to get in is working. How about the plan to get out? 
I'm working on it. 
Warrior Zhao. 
I'm so honored, that you've come 
Page 26/36
all this way to attend my wedding. I'm not here to attend yourwedding. I'm here to attend your funeral.

I'm not the Black knight, okay? I'm... I'm Jack Bronson. 
Jack Bronson. 
I've got good news. 
And I have bad news. 
The good news is... 
tomorrow... when my 
bride and I are married. 
We will stand... there. 
And you two... will stand... 
there. 
Okay, what's the bad news? 
As soon as we've taken our vows... you know, new life begins... 
your life ends. 
He's not bluffing, is he? 
Arun doesn't do bluffs. 
Even maybe he'll be feeling generous 'cause it his wedding day, and he'll pardon us. Arun doesn't do generous. 
Okay, ifhe doesn't do this 
and he doesn't do that... 
is there anything that he does do? Well, he rapes, murders, and pillagers. I guess in anotherwords we're dead. When one door closes, another one opens. See?

Of course, you are. 
You're the Black knight. 
You have skills. 
Okay, I don't... I don't get it. 
'Cause, one minute you told me I'm worthless, and after a few lessons, I'm not? It's notjust me who thinks 
you're notworthless, Jack. 
The way the Princess looks 
at you.. She believes in you.
