00:
Fallow arriving, area A. Do you copy?
2
00:
Hi, Mr. Fallow. Welcome.
3
00:
Hi, so nice to see you!
4
00:
Careful with that!
5
00:
We're in a bit of a rush...
6
00:
so let's hop on the cart and get going.
7
00:
There are a lot of people waiting.
8
00:
We're so honored to have you.
9
00:
This is really
an historic occasion, Peter.
10
00:
Mr. Fallow, I'd like
to take this private moment...
11
00:

Page 2/168

to tell you how much I admire your book.
12
00:
When Faulkner was asked
to recommend three novels, he said:
13
00:
"Anna Karenina, Anna Karenina,
Anna Karenina."
14
00:
Today, he'd say:
"The Real McCoy and the Forgotten Lamb.
15
00:
"The Real McCoy and the Forgotten Lamb,
The Real McCoy and..."
16
00:
I know you've heard it a million times...
17
00:
but the scene where the mayor is hit
in the head with the mayonnaise jar...
18
00:
Well, to be continued.
19
00:
Right this way.
20
00:
I've got Mr. Fallow.
21

Page 3/168

00:
Get away!
This should never have happened.
22
00:
I'm so sorry.
23
00:
Right this way, Mr. Fallow.
24
00:
We're just going through these two doors.
25
00:
We're on our way.
26
00:
But I must say, if I may quote you...
27
00:
Look at all the busy bees.
28
00:
If I may quote you...
29
00:
"How in the name of God...
Who in the name of God...
30
00:
"would bring a half-eaten jar
of mayonnaise to a public meeting?"
31

Page 4/168

00:
Ambassador!
32
00:
I'm Charles Buchanan. This is my wife,
Stephanie, and my daughter.
33
00:
Mr. Fallow, I read your book 15 times.
34
00:
Next year, next year I'm going
to take a course in it.
35
00:
We're going to go up by ourselves.
36
00:
Are you hungry?
37
00:
That's salmon, but I don't think
you should touch that.
38
00:
Mr. Fallow, it's such an honor
to finally meet you.
39
00:
Oh, my God!
40
00:
Oh, my God!
41

Page 5/168

00:
We are running a bit late.
42
00:
I don't know what to say. Let me see...
43
00:
-What's your name?
-Suzanne.
44
00:
Are you married?
45
00:
Excuse me!
46
00:
Excuse me!
47
00:
Animals!
48
00:
Someone needs deodorant.
49
00:
All right, all right, here we go.
50
00:
Everything is under control.
51
00:
Nothing to worry about.
52

Page 6/168

00:
Excuse me. I haven't
introduced myself, have I?
53
00:
My name is Peter Fallow.
54
00:
I am a writer.
55
00:
But you know that already.
56
00:
Unless you haven't read a newspaper
or seen a TV recently...
57
00:
you know exactly who I am.
58
00:
I am the man of the moment.
59
00:
The hero of the evening.
60
00:
Me and a book I happened to write.
61
00:
The real hero of the evening
is not even with us tonight.
62

Page 7/168

00:
We'll come to him in a minute.
63
00:
For now, indulge yourself
in the extravagance of the moment...
64
00:
and remember, ifyou will,
a phrase from another little best-seller.
65
00:
"What does it profit a man if he gains
the whole world and loses his soul?"
66
00:
They're waiting.
67
00:
This is a story about such a man.
68
00:
There he is!
69
00:
And it begins on a rainy night
a little over a year ago.
70
00:
Our hero, Sherman McCoy,
was about to make a simple phone call.
71
00:
But despite the existence of 11 phones
and seven different lines...

Page 8/168

72
00:
in the 14 rooms
of his $6-million-plus apartment...
73
00:
this was a phone call
he could not make at home.
74
00:
Gotcha!
75
00:
What on earth are you doing?
76
00:
I'm taking the dog for a walk.
77
00:
You're not taking "the dog" for a walk,
you're taking "Marshall."
78
00:
Marshall has a name. He's family.
And, anyway...
79
00:
it's raining.
80
00:
I know that.
81
00:
So does Marshall.

Page 9/168

82
00:
He doesn't want to go.
83
00:
Do you, Marshall?
84
00:
Judy...
85
00:
All right. Have a nice time.
86
00:
He's not happy about it, Mr. McCoy.
87
00:
Neither am I, Bill.
88
00:
Tony, sir. My name is Tony.
89
00:
Well, whatever.
90
00:
Let's be men about this.
91
00:
Hello, Sherman.
92
00:
Good evening, Pollard.

Page 10/168

93
00:
It's raining, you know.
94
00:
I did notice, yes.
95
00:
Ah, Sherman, a true friend
to man's best friend.
96
00:
Pollard, you old phrase-maker.
97
00:
I beg your pardon?
98
00:
Is that the best you can do?
99
00:
Is that as witty as we get?
100
00:
I don't know what you're talking about.
101
00:
Furthermore, if you're wet
when you return, take the service elevator.
102
00:
Come on, Marshall.
103

Page 11/168

00:
Maria, hello. It's me.
104
00:
Who?
105
00:
I'm sorry.
May I speak to Maria?
106
00:
Who is this?
107
00:
Maria?
108
00:
Sherman?
109
00:
Sherman, is that you?
110
00:
Jesus!
111
00:
We're back.
112
00:
You were right. I got soaking wet
and Marshall didn't do anything.
113
00:
If you want to talk to a Maria...

Page 12/168

114
00:
why call me?
115
00:
What do you mean?
116
00:
Please don't lie.
It makes your forehead crinkle.
117
00:
What are we talking about?
118
00:
You should see your face.
119
00:
I don't get it.
Did I miss something?
120
00:
You're going to stand there and say
you didn't call here asking for Maria?
121
00:
You think I don't know your voice?
122
00:
Judy, I was out walking the dog.
123
00:
Crinkle, crinkle.
124

Page 13/168

00:
I am not lying. I took the dog for a walk.
125
00:
Then I came back here and wham!
126
00:
I hardly know what to say.
127
00:
You are asking me to prove
a negative proposition.
128
00:
Negative proposition?
129
00:
Oh, God, Sherman.
130
00:
Listen to the way I sound.
Listen to the stress. Hear it?
131
00:
I don't want to be this person. I don't.
132
00:
I am thin and beautiful.
133
00:
I do not deserve this.
134
00:

Page 14/168

Here's the phone. Call her from here.
135
00:
I don't mind. I really don't mind.
136
00:
You are cheap and rotten and a liar.
137
00:
And you are dripping
on my Aubusson carpet.
138
00:
She was right.
139
00:
And Sherman knew it.
140
00:
Christ! How could he have been so stupid?
141
00:
A simple phone call.
142
00:
The next day, Judy's words still rang
in his ears.
143
00:
"Cheap, rotten and a liar."
144
00:
-Campbell, are we ready?
-I'm out of here.

Page 15/168

145
00:
Hold on.
146
00:
Where is your mother?
147
00:
Campbell!
148
00:
She's crying on the Lifecycle.
149
00:
"Crying on the Lifecycle."
150
00:
Like so many men before him,
he was no match for a woman's tears.
151
00:
She won't kiss me because I'm all wet.
152
00:
Campbell, come and give
your mother a kiss.
153
00:
Judy?
154
00:
Why couldn't hejust say it:
155

Page 16/168

00:
"Look, Judy, I still love you.
156
00:
"I still love our daughter,
our home, our life.
157
00:
"But I am a Master of the Universe.
158
00:
"I deserve more."
159
00:
Like the few privileged others
on Wall Street.
160
00:
How many? Two, three,
maybe 400 at most.
161
00:
For these men,
these Masters of the Universe...
162
00:
and Sherman McCoy was one of them...
163
00:
there were no limits whatsoever.
164
00:
Hi. This is 555-8771.
165

Page 17/168

00:
Leave a message and I'll call you back.
Thank you.
166
00:
Maria, I've been calling you for days.
Call me at the office.
167
00:
Gene's on from London.
168
00:
-Let's go! Let's go!
-Calm down, Rawlie.
169
00:
Let's not get overexcited.
170
00:
Calm, cool, collated.
171
00:
Let's not lose our composure
over a few hundred million dollars.
172
00:
Christ, Sherman, you must be made of ice.
173
00:
Just remember, a frantic salesman
is a dead one.
174
00:
What the hell
will this crazy Giscard deal cost us?

Page 18/168

175
00:
I need $600,000,000 to buy the bonds.
176
00:
You want us to sit
on $600,000,000 worth...
177
00:
of French government bonds?
178
00:
I'm confident on this.
It's a real sleeping beauty.
179
00:
-Where are you, Gene?
-At a cricket match.
180
00:
Somebody just hit the hell out of the ball.
181
00:
-Who's playing?
-Don't get technical.
182
00:
A bunch of men in white pants.
183
00:
How about it? Are we in or out?
184
00:
Gold has to hold steady.

Page 19/168

185
00:
Bernard Sachs is already in
for $300,000,000.
186
00:
Feel better?
187
00:
You are going to make me
an old man.
188
00:
A rich old man, Gene. A rich old man.
189
00:
A $600,000,000 deal.
190
00:
Sherman's commission
would be $1.7 million.
191
00:
All in a day's work.
192
00:
He was there! At the top!
193
00:
Impervious, untouchable...
194
00:
insulated by wealth and power.
195

Page 20/168

00:
A Master of the Universe.
196
00:
A great height
from which to view the world.
197
00:
A great height from which to fall.
198
00:
Sherman, you are an absolute angel
coming all the way out here.
199
00:
I had to talk to you.
I did a very stupid thing.
200
00:
Are we going to talk about it now?
201
00:
I'm afraid we have to.
202
00:
Sherman, don't you want
a little poontang first?
203
00:
I know it has its funny side,
but it isn't funny.
204
00:
It's your own fault

Page 21/168

for getting caught like a red herring.
205
00:
You mean red-handed.
206
00:
Can't we stop talking
about your wife now...
207
00:
and head over to our little hideaway
on 59th Street and just hide away a little?
208
00:
I think she knows.
209
00:
Of course she knows. That's not the point.
210
00:
It isn't?
211
00:
God, Sherman, you are so sweet.
212
00:
I could eat you alive if I could get
this goddamn zipper down.
213
00:
Isn't that the turnoff?
214
00:
The turnoff to Manhattan?

Page 22/168

215
00:
I can't get over right now.
216
00:
We'll just exit and get back on.
217
00:
Exit and get back on.
218
00:
Maria!
219
00:
Where are we?
220
00:
The Bronx.
221
00:
What does that mean?
222
00:
It means we're
north of Manhattan.
223
00:
All I need to do is make a right
and find a street back.
224
00:
And there it was.
225

Page 23/168

00:
A simple wrong turn.
226
00:
Anyone could have done it.
227
00:
A simple phone call...
228
00:
a simple wrong turn,
and you're off the track...
229
00:
moving towards a destiny
you never imagined.
230
00:
-Sherman?
-Yes, Maria.
231
00:
Where are all the white people?
232
00:
Are they going to scratch the car?
233
00:
I'm from the South
and I don't like this very much.
234
00:
Excuse me.
235

Page 24/168

00:
Please don't touch the car.
236
00:
Get us out of here.
237
00:
I have a red light.
238
00:
Hey, baby!
239
00:
We're having a party!
240
00:
Get us out of here!
241
00:
I want my money.
I want my money now!
242
00:
There was no need to panic.
243
00:
That's what you think.
244
00:
I have all my luggage with me.
245
00:
I just don't want to do anything stupid.
If we keep our heads, we'll be fine.

Page 25/168

246
00:
We're in the middle
of a war zone...
247
00:
and you're worried about
doing the right thing?
248
00:
An arrow!
249
00:
Right there. It's an arrow!
250
00:
I see it.
251
00:
Then turn!
252
00:
I'm going to.
253
00:
There's the ramp
back to Manhattan. See?
254
00:
What's that?
255
00:
It's a body!
256

Page 26/168

00:
It's an animal!
257
00:
Is it dead?
258
00:
It's a tire, that's all!
259
00:
-It's a dead tire?
-Calm down! It's just a tire!
260
00:
What are you doing?
261
00:
I can't drive around it.
262
00:
You're going to move it?
263
00:
Yes, that's exactly what I'm going to do.
264
00:
Sherman, be careful of your shoes.
265
00:
Sherman, come on.
266
00:
Touching that dirty old tire.

Page 27/168

267
00:
I just want to get out of here.
268
00:
I want to get to Manhattan.
269
00:
Come on, Sherman.
270
00:
Oh, my God.
271
00:
Oh, my God.
272
00:
Natives!
273
00:
Sherman! Sherman!
274
00:
Yo. Need some help?
275
00:
No.
276
00:
No, thank you. Hi!
277
00:
What's the problem? Need help or what?

Page 28/168

278
00:
I don't think so. No. Thank you.
Very much.
279
00:
Shit.
280
00:
Shit!
281
00:
Sherman, come on!
282
00:
Sherman.
283
00:
I have to go.
284
00:
Where are you going with the tire?
285
00:
This is yours? Oh, then here, you take it.
286
00:
Oh, my God!
287
00:
Get in the car, quick!
288
00:

Page 29/168

Here they come!
289
00:
Lock the door!
290
00:
Drive.
291
00:
Open the door!
292
00:
Get away! Get away!
293
00:
Careful. Look out!
294
00:
Back up!
295
00:
Get away from the car! I can't see a thing!
296
00:
Watch out!
297
00:
Go, car!
298
00:
Bitch, open this door!
299
00:

Page 30/168

Where's the ramp?
300
00:
What are we doing here?
301
00:
Just make a left.
302
00:
A left? Okay, a left.
303
00:
Sherman, fuck the luggage.
Let's go have a drink.
304
00:
Maybe we should tell
the police about this.
305
00:
The police?
306
00:
Yes, the police.
We were almost robbed.
307
00:
There's a possibility that you...
that we hit one of them.
308
00:
There was this sound,
like we hit one of them.
309

Page 31/168

00:
Did you see him get hit?
310
00:
No.
311
00:
Neither did I.
312
00:
So, if a question ever arises,
two boys blocked the road.
313
00:
They tried to rob us, and we got away.
That's all we know.
314
00:
But if we call the police now,
then we're not--
315
00:
Let's call them and invite them
to our little love nest.
316
00:
They'd love to get us.
317
00:
The police, the press,
and all the rest of the "mediarites."
318
00:
Mediarites?
319

Page 32/168

00:
The newspapers, radio, television.
I can see it now.
320
00:
"Mr. Sherman McCoy of Park Avenue,
and Mrs. Arthur Ruskin of Fifth Avenue...
321
00:
"are recuperating after their adventures
in the Bronx."
322
00:
Explain that one to your wife.
323
00:
Yes, you have a point.
324
00:
But I'd feel better if--
325
00:
You don't have to feel better.
326
00:
I was the one who was driving.
327
00:
And I say I didn't hit anybody.
328
00:
And I'm not reporting anything
to the police.
329

Page 33/168

00:
And if you're a gentleman,
you'll support me in that decision.
330
00:
We were in the jungle.
331
00:
-We were attacked.
-That's true.
332
00:
-We fought our way out.
-We could've been killed.
333
00:
We fought.
334
00:
I feel like an animal.
335
00:
You drove the hell out of that car.
336
00:
The hard part was getting into the seat,
over that gearshift.
337
00:
No, it was instinct.
338
00:
God, and that tire!
339

Page 34/168

00:
-He was big, wasn't he?
-Sherman was bigger.
340
00:
-You were great.
-We were both great.
341
00:
This could be the best sex we've had
in a long time.
342
00:
-I still think--
-Don't think!
343
00:
Just fuck!
344
00:
Mr. Sonnenberg?
345
00:
Where the hell is Mr. Sonnenberg?
346
00:
Mr. Lockwood, you sit down.
If and when your lawyer appears--
347
00:
Two to six, Judge.
348
00:
Two to six. Two weeks ago,

Page 35/168

he told me two to six.
349
00:
Two to six, or we go to trial.
350
00:
-Nobody wants to go to trial.
-I'll go.
351
00:
Approach the bench.
352
00:
I'll approach the bench.
353
00:
Listen, you son of a bitch.
You're a nice boy, with a lot going for you.
354
00:
We got 7,000 felony indictments
in the Bronx every year.
355
00:
We got room for 650 trials.
Yours isn't one of them.
356
00:
I go to trial.
357
00:
You go sit down.
358
00:

Page 36/168

And you'll take whatever plea bargain
we give you.
359
00:
You'll kiss my ass and thank me
that I didn't put you away for 25 years.
360
00:
That's what you'd get if this case goes
to trial. Now get out of my face.
361
00:
What'd he do?
362
00:
Robbed and raped a 70-year-old lady
and put her in a garbage can.
363
00:
Jesus Christ.
364
00:
Welcome to the South Bronx.
365
00:
People versus Harold Williams.
366
00:
Indictment number 294721.
367
00:
This case was dismissed three weeks ago.
368
00:

Page 37/168

Go get 'em, tiger.
369
00:
Why is this case here?
370
00:
May I approach the bench, Your Honor?
371
00:
Who the hell are you?
372
00:
Assistant District Attorney Kramer.
373
00:
Mr. Kramer, you are new here.
374
00:
Let me explain something to you.
375
00:
This case is what we call a piece of shit.
376
00:
Which, loosely translated,
means you don't have any evidence.
377
00:
Except that District Attorney Weiss
has instructed me to show you--
378
00:
I know who the District Attorney is,
Mr. Kramer.

Page 38/168

379
00:
The only reason Mr. Weiss is interested
in this case...
380
00:
is because Mr. Williams over there...
381
00:
is a white man who lives
in a nice big house in Riverdale.
382
00:
I'm not following you.
383
00:
Because it's an election year.
384
00:
Ninety-nine percent of those you shovel
through this court are black...
385
00:
and the other ninety-nine percent
don't speak English.
386
00:
But they do vote.
387
00:
So your boss, the District Attorney,
Mr. Weiss...
388
00:

Page 39/168

who dreams every night
of one day becoming mayor of New York...
389
00:
needs a white man.
390
00:
He needs to find him, book him,
and throw him in jail.
391
00:
Then everybody likes him.
392
00:
The press and voters like him.
393
00:
Even your mother would like him.
394
00:
-You following me?
-I am now.
395
00:
Now you tell your boss,
"Captain Ahab" Weiss...
396
00:
that I know he's out there looking
for "the great white defendant."
397
00:
But Mr. Williams, over there, is not it!
398

Page 40/168

00:
Don't take it personally.
399
00:
Maybe he didn't like your shoes.
400
00:
You Andruitti?
401
00:
I'm Martin, this is Goldberg.
We just came from Bronx Hospital.
402
00:
Kid named Henry Lamb came in last night
with a broken wrist.
403
00:
They fixed him up and sent him home.
404
00:
This morning, he comes back in
with a concussion.
405
00:
He goes into a coma
and now they say he'll die.
406
00:
Did you talk to him?
407
00:
He's in a coma.
408

Page 41/168

00:
What else?
409
00:
There's a nurse busting my balls.
410
00:
Says the kid told his mother he was hit
by a Mercedes, which drove off.
411
00:
-Hit-and-run.
-The mother told you this?
412
00:
She's got a pile of parking tickets
and won't talk to the police.
413
00:
Why come to us?
414
00:
You've got an unconscious victim,
no witness, and no driver.
415
00:
You've got what we call a piece of shit.
Right, Kramer?
416
00:
What we've got is a problem.
417
00:
Ever hear of Reverend Bacon?
418

Page 42/168

00:
No, not me, gentlemen.
419
00:
Kramer, this is all yours. See you later.
420
00:
Reverend Bacon?
421
00:
This is a tragedy!
422
00:
A fine young man has been struck down.
423
00:
God-fearing, church-going,
never in trouble...
424
00:
graduated from high school,
on his way to college.
425
00:
Somebody comes along,
some rich white people...
426
00:
in a rich white man's car and wham!
427
00:
They run him down and never even stop.
428

Page 43/168

00:
Now what'll we do
about these parking tickets?
429
00:
First of all, Reverend...is it Reverend?
430
00:
Is, was and always will be.
431
00:
First of all, we have no evidence--
432
00:
This is your evidence!
433
00:
I'm sorry. I didn't see you.
434
00:
Mrs. Lamb is not speaking to the police.
435
00:
Until we have proper counsel,
I'll speak for her.
436
00:
Fine. That's good.
437
00:
I just want to get a few things straight.
The boy was hit by a car?
438
00:

Page 44/168

On Bruckner Boulevard!
439
00:
Innocently walking along
minding his own business.
440
00:
A clear case of hit-and-run.
441
00:
But there were no witnesses.
Without a witness, you have no case.
442
00:
You got what he told his mother.
443
00:
It's hearsay.
444
00:
You and I may believe it,
but it's not admissible in a court of law.
445
00:
If this boy was born on Park Avenue...
446
00:
and was run down by two niggers
in a Pontiac...
447
00:
then you'd have a case, right?
448
00:

Page 45/168

I work Park Avenue
and Bruckner Boulevard.
449
00:
There's good and bad in both places.
450
00:
We'll try to help this lady...
451
00:
but there's not much to go on.
452
00:
I want you to make an investment here.
453
00:
An investment in steam control.
454
00:
Steam control?
455
00:
Steam control.
456
00:
A righteous steam is building up
in the souls of my people.
457
00:
And that steam is ready to blow!
458
00:
I see.
459

Page 46/168

00:
On Judgment Day, I am your safety valve.
460
00:
Because when it blows, and it will...
461
00:
how grateful you will be
that I am on your side.
462
00:
The one nigger who can control
the steam and save your white ass...
463
00:
from being burned
off the face of the earth.
464
00:
So to speak.
465
00:
Thank you. We'll see what we can do.
466
00:
Excuse me.
467
00:
Thank you.
468
00:
He said...
469

Page 47/168

00:
He said it started with an "R."
470
00:
The second letter was an "E"...
471
00:
or a "P."
472
00:
Those were the first two letters
of the license plate.
473
00:
We should move up here.
474
00:
Have you ever thought about moving out
of New York?
475
00:
Keep a small place in town.
Save loads of money. What do you think?
476
00:
About what?
477
00:
Do you think we could leave New York?
478
00:
No.
479
00:

Page 48/168

My father did it.
480
00:
You are not your father.
481
00:
She knew how to hurt a guy.
482
00:
No, he was nothing like his father.
483
00:
His father, "The Lion of Dunning,
Sponget and Leach."
484
00:
His father, who took the subway
to work every day of his life.
485
00:
His father, who believed
in principles and ethics...
486
00:
whose lessons about duty and debt
had whistled through his son's head.
487
00:
Sherman McCoy was
nothing like his father.
488
00:
What're you looking for
in that paper?
489

Page 49/168

00:
Nothing. Nothing special.
490
00:
What's a bond?
491
00:
Sherman, do explain it.
492
00:
Yes, your mother and I really want
to hear this.
493
00:
A bond is a way of lending people money.
494
00:
Say you want to build a road or a hospital,
and you need a lot of money.
495
00:
What you do is issue a bond.
496
00:
Do you build roads?
497
00:
No, I don't actually build them.
498
00:
You're in over your head.
499
00:

Page 50/168

Let me try.
500
00:
Darling, Daddy doesn't build roads
or hospitals or anything, really.
501
00:
Daddy handles bonds for the people
who raise the money.
502
00:
That's what he said. Bonds.
503
00:
Just imagine that a bond is a slice of cake.
504
00:
Now, you didn't bake that cake.
505
00:
But every time you hand a slice
of that cake to somebody else...
506
00:
a little piece comes off.
507
00:
Little crumbs fall off.
508
00:
Really. Crumbs?
509
00:
And you are allowed to keep those crumbs.

Page 51/168

510
00:
And many a man has sold his soul
for those little crumbs.
511
00:
And that's what Daddy does.
512
00:
Daddy passes somebody else's cake around
and picks up all of the crumbs.
513
00:
But you have to imagine a lot of crumbs,
and a great big golden cake...
514
00:
and a lot of golden crumbs.
515
00:
And imagine Daddy running around
picking up every little golden crumb...
516
00:
he can grab.
517
00:
And that's what Daddy does.
518
00:
You can call them crumbs if you want to.
519
00:
I'm doing the best I can.

Page 52/168

520
00:
Excuse me.
521
00:
In my day, there was some integrity to it.
522
00:
Now it isn't about anything, is it?
Except the money.
523
00:
Well, I don't make the rules, so...
524
00:
All the more reason not to play the game.
525
00:
We're just having a little...
526
00:
It's nothing really.
527
00:
Up to this point in our story,
I was blissfully ignorant.
528
00:
I had no idea of the storm
that was gathering.
529
00:
Never even heard of Sherman McCoy.
530

Page 53/168

00:
Hadn't the faintest notion that soon
his name would be inexorably tied to mine.
531
00:
That his fate would be inextricably bound
to my own destiny.
532
00:
I had my own problems...
533
00:
and I had no idea that Sherman McCoy
was the solution I was looking for.
534
00:
You're bad!
535
00:
Caroline, you look beautiful!
536
00:
-You devil.
-You pig.
537
00:
-Join us for a cocktail.
-No, I'm with someone.
538
00:
And a pretty someone he is.
539
00:
Filippo Chirazzi, the artist.

Page 54/168

Peter Fallow, the has-been.
540
00:
Enchant.
541
00:
We're crowded this evening.
542
00:
Why don't you sit on top of Billy Cortez?
543
00:
I'll see if Caroline will sit on my face.
544
00:
No thanks. The last time I sat on your face
I got a yeast infection.
545
00:
Good evening, Peter.
546
00:
Good evening.
547
00:
Don't get up. Do you know my daughter?
548
00:
Of course. How are you, Evelyn?
549
00:
This is one of my invisible employees.
550

Page 55/168

00:
One of the many journalists
who supposedly write for my newspaper.
551
00:
You're very honored to see him.
552
00:
I rarely do.
553
00:
I can explain. Come have a drink--
554
00:
We're having a private party.
555
00:
I was at a dinner last evening,
and halfway through the pudding...
556
00:
a 4-year-old child came in
dragging a little toy cart.
557
00:
And on the cart was a fresh turd.
558
00:
Her own, I suppose.
559
00:
The parents just shook their heads
and smiled.
560

Page 56/168

00:
I've made a big investment in you, Peter.
561
00:
Time and money, and it's not working.
562
00:
I could just shake my head and smile.
563
00:
But in my house, when a turd appears,
we deal with it.
564
00:
We dispose of it. We flush it away.
565
00:
We don't put it on the table
and call it caviar.
566
00:
Of course you don't.
I've been working at home.
567
00:
I'm working on a story that I can't talk
about here. It's a big story.
568
00:
I sincerely hope so, Peter.
569
00:
I sincerely hope so.
570

Page 57/168

00:
It was the end of the road for me.
I could see it coming.
571
00:
See it coming? It was here.
572
00:
I'd had my chance and I'd blown it away
in a bottle.
573
00:
It was over. I had to face up to that fact.
574
00:
I could go back home.
575
00:
Small town, small newspaper.
576
00:
Or I could write a novel or two.
577
00:
Or I could slit my wrists.
578
00:
This last idea seemed most appealing,
as it required the least amount of effort.
579
00:
And then the telephone rang.
580
00:

Page 58/168

Yeah?
581
00:
Peter! Albert Fox here.
582
00:
Peter?
583
00:
Peter!
584
00:
Yeah, this is Peter.
585
00:
You sound terrific.
586
00:
Any pulse?
587
00:
I called the paper. No one knew
where you were or who you were.
588
00:
Anything I should know?
589
00:
No, I'm just working at home today.
590
00:
Good. There's something
I want to talk to you about.
591

Page 59/168

00:
There's a hell of a story in it.
592
00:
Meet me at NBC, studio 4H, 7:00.
593
00:
Ciao.
594
00:
Yeah. Ciao.
595
00:
You see that Henry Lamb material?
596
00:
Yeah, I looked at it.
597
00:
What do you think?
598
00:
What do I think?
599
00:
I think it's an unfortunate situation.
600
00:
Where's the Goddamn story?
601
00:
A poor, innocent black kid
walking down the street...

Page 60/168

602
00:
and boom! Hit-and-run.
There's a story in it for somebody.
603
00:
The black community's up in arms.
604
00:
And when Reverend Bacon gets a feather
in his ass, the shit flies high.
605
00:
What's your angle on all this?
606
00:
What do you stand to get out of it?
607
00:
I'm a lawyer. I want justice done.
608
00:
Reverend Bacon is my friend.
It'll be good for him.
609
00:
And knowing your situation,
I thought if you broke the story--
610
00:
Wait a minute.
611
00:
What do you mean, my situation?

Page 61/168

612
00:
Your boss was at my house for dinner.
613
00:
He said a few things.
614
00:
I see.
615
00:
-You have a little daughter?
-Yes, I do.
616
00:
I bet she has a toy wagon.
617
00:
Yes, she does. Why?
618
00:
Got any scotch in that car?
619
00:
Henry Lamb. Who's that?
620
00:
He was a student of yours
at Ruppert High.
621
00:
He was? What's he done?
622

Page 62/168

00:
Nothing. He's been seriously injured.
623
00:
I'm a newspaper reporter.
624
00:
I don't remember him.
625
00:
What kind of student was he?
626
00:
If I don't remember him,
I guess he was okay.
627
00:
Was he a good student?
628
00:
Good doesn't apply at Ruppert High.
They're cooperative or life-threatening.
629
00:
-Wasn't he going to college?
-City College.
630
00:
If you live in the city, graduate high school,
and breathe, they take you.
631
00:
What about his performance in class?
Any aptitude, special skills?
632

Page 63/168

00:
I got 65 students in each class.
633
00:
Tests, homework, any written work?
634
00:
There hasn't been written work
at Ruppert High for 20 years.
635
00:
How do you keep track of the kids?
636
00:
There must be some records.
637
00:
You're thinking about
honor students and grades.
638
00:
We don't make those comparisons.
We just try to keep them off the streets.
639
00:
At Ruppert, an honor student...
640
00:
is somebody who comes to class
and doesn't piss on the teacher.
641
00:
By that standard...
642

Page 64/168

00:
was Henry Lamb an honor student?
643
00:
He never pissed on me.
644
00:
No, you're exaggerating
the situation. The franc is no problem.
645
00:
We can hedge that to next January,
to the term or to both, whatever.
646
00:
I don't think that's necessary.
647
00:
Look, Bernard, we've had our share of...
648
00:
Hell, I wouldn't even call them...problems,
so let's not work ourselves up...
649
00:
into a...coma.
650
00:
Jesus Christ, let me see that!
651
00:
No, not you, Bernard.
652

Page 65/168

00:
Wait. What the hell are you talking about?
653
00:
No, we can't wait.
We have to move on this thing now.
654
00:
You're bringing up phantom issues!
655
00:
We must pull ourselves together
and fucking do it!
656
00:
Look!
657
00:
Bernard. Bernard!
658
00:
But it was too late. It was gone.
659
00:
Oh, Jesus.
660
00:
$600,000,000.
661
00:
On Wall Street, a frantic salesman was
a dead salesman. And Sherman knew it.
662
00:

You know what?
663
00:
I was just thinking of you.
Where have you been?
664
00:
Have you seen this?
665
00:
-Don't I get a kiss first?
-Have you read it?
666
00:
You know I only read
the newspapers spasmodically.
667
00:
Sporadically?
668
00:
Who is this Peter Fallow
character? He's got it all wrong!
669
00:
Excuse me, but what is going on here?
670
00:
I'm installing a new intercom system.
Super let me in.
671
00:
Are you Caroline Heftshank?
672

Page 67/168

00:
I need you to sign a receipt.
673
00:
I don't live here.
I'm a guest of Miss Heftshank.
674
00:
No problem. I'm all done.
675
00:
-That was close.
-What's going on?
676
00:
I don't know. Caroline pays $300 rent
for this place.
677
00:
It's rent-controlled. I sublet it for $1,100.
678
00:
But it's not legal.
679
00:
To get Caroline out,
they have to prove she doesn't live here.
680
00:
Isn't it weird that he came here today?
After that piece in the paper?
681
00:
You are completely "paranoidical."
682

Page 68/168

00:
I have to leave for the airport
in about 20 minutes.
683
00:
So, we don't have much time.
684
00:
Do you think they could trace
the car to me?
685
00:
How? They don't have
the full number or a witness.
686
00:
The only person who could recognize you
is in terminal "comatosis."
687
00:
But the other fella.
Suppose he comes forward?
688
00:
If he was going to materialize,
he would have by now.
689
00:
And he hasn't because he's a criminal.
690
00:
What a wretched painting.
691
00:

Page 69/168

It's a Filippo Chirazzi.
He's a friend of Caroline's.
692
00:
-Know him?
-I hope not. God, that looks like you.
693
00:
No. How could it?
694
00:
-Where are you going?
-The airport. The car's coming soon.
695
00:
We have time for a quickie.
What do you say?
696
00:
I've lost $600,000,000 today.
Possibly my job.
697
00:
I don't feel terrifically sexy at the moment.
698
00:
You know I'm a sucker
for a soft dick, Sherman.
699
00:
You are incorrigible.
700
00:
I suppose we could still go to the police.
We could get a talented lawyer.

Page 70/168

701
00:
And put our heads right
into the tiger's mouth?
702
00:
I'm the one who was driving the car.
703
00:
Shouldn't I be the one
to make that decision?
704
00:
And I say no. I say no.
705
00:
Trust me.
706
00:
Nothing will come
of that little newspaper article.
707
00:
Absolutely nothing.
708
00:
Mr. Fallow. Our hero.
709
00:
Reverend Bacon.
710
00:
I feel as we already know each other.
And Mr. Corsaro.

Page 71/168

711
00:
Nice to see you again.
712
00:
You have an exclusive.
Understand?
713
00:
I could've had every newspaper
and TV station spreading this news.
714
00:
But I have chosen only
you two. And I expect big coverage.
715
00:
In-depth coverage.
716
00:
Let's get to work.
717
00:
Let's go.
718
00:
Might we be making a mountain
out of a molehill? Honestly--
719
00:
Honesty has nothing to do with this.
720
00:
This is show business. I've never known

Page 72/168

the two to go hand in hand.
721
00:
Neither have I.
And I'm supposed to be a journalist.
722
00:
You're a drunk. That's what I heard.
723
00:
And you're almost out of a job.
Or am I misinformed?
724
00:
You have the wrong man.
725
00:
No, I don't think so.
726
00:
I don't think so at all.
727
00:
TV's ready, Reverend.
728
00:
Stay in the wide shot.
Push in when you see the action.
729
00:
He's something, isn't he?
730
00:
He sure is.

Page 73/168

731
00:
He's on the level with this one, right?
The story's legitimate.
732
00:
Of course.
733
00:
This Henry Lamb's a nice kid.
734
00:
The neighbors like him. No record.
Honor student.
735
00:
No question about it.
736
00:
Personally, I don't care. But, when I finish
with this story, the kid'll be a saint.
737
00:
Be nice to know it's true, that's all.
738
00:
It's true.
739
00:
We're rolling the cameras. Go ahead.
740
00:
Brothers and sisters, I stand before you
with a heart that is broken.

Page 74/168

741
00:
And I stand before you
with a heart that is angry.
742
00:
It's heartbroken because our brother,
our neighbor, our son, Henry Lamb...
743
00:
has been struck down
in the prime of his young life.
744
00:
And now he lies in a hospital...
broken, like my heart.
745
00:
But I tell you, my heart is also angry.
746
00:
Yes! Angry!
747
00:
Because the driver
of that car didn't do nothing for him!
748
00:
And neither did the police!
749
00:
And neither did this man!
750
00:

Page 75/168

Mr. Abraham Weiss.
751
00:
That's my name. My own fucking name.
752
00:
That's a complete fuck-up.
753
00:
-Who the hell are you?
-Assistant District Attorney Kramer.
754
00:
I work in this office.
755
00:
Sources at Motor Vehicles say...
756
00:
less than 200 Mercedes have plates
beginning with "RE," "RB," or "RP."
757
00:
How did they get this information
out of Motor Vehicles?
758
00:
Calm down. We've had this information
for over a week.
759
00:
Why aren't we doing anything about it?
Why aren't we tracing the car?
760

Page 76/168

00:
Actually, I suggested we--
761
00:
What am I? The Wizard of Oz?
762
00:
Trace the car? Trace the car?
We don't even have a witness.
763
00:
We don't know where it happened,
or even if it happened.
764
00:
Trace the car.
765
00:
We don't have a case,
even if we find the car.
766
00:
If we found the driver,
and the driver came to us and said:
767
00:
"Yeah, that's right.
768
00:
"I hit this kid the other night,
and I didn't stop.
769
00:
"I didn't report it. I'm the guy. I did it."
Then we got a case.

Page 77/168

770
00:
Just trace the fucking car.
771
00:
Yesterday, I was
a respected Jewish liberal.
772
00:
Ten minutes of news like this,
and now I'm a hymie racist pig?
773
00:
The Italians are going to love this.
774
00:
The Irish, too.
775
00:
And the WASPs.
776
00:
They love this shit more than anybody.
777
00:
They love laughing at me.
778
00:
All the rich sons of bitches.
779
00:
They still think they own this town.
780

Page 78/168

00:
They sit in their co-ops, Park Avenue, Fifth,
Beekman Place, snug like a bug.
781
00:
Twelve-foot ceilings, a wing for them,
one for the help.
782
00:
They think money'll protect them.
783
00:
You stupid sons of bitches!
784
00:
I'd like to light a fire under their
white asses. Let them see how it feels.
785
00:
Let the Third World see the smoke
and come after them!
786
00:
Let them feel what it's like when every
Puerto Rican, West Indian, Cuban, Korean...
787
00:
Albanian, Filipino, black man
from every borough...
788
00:
The future knows how to cross a bridge!
789
00:
You laugh.

Page 79/168

790
00:
You laugh! All right!
Here's what we're going to do!
791
00:
We're going to turn this thing around
if it kills us!
792
00:
We'll prove to these black motherfuckers--
793
00:
Pardon my language.
794
00:
We'll prove to these niggers
that this administration loves them!
795
00:
No matter what it takes.
796
00:
I am no racist hymie.
797
00:
By November...
798
00:
they are going to be thinking of me as...
799
00:
the first black district attorney
of Bronx County.

Page 80/168

800
00:
They're going to beg me to be mayor.
801
00:
We'll walk away with that election.
802
00:
No question!
803
00:
That's what we'll do!
804
00:
Yes!
805
00:
If we have to screw every white asshole
from Albany to Park Avenue, we will!
806
00:
Here he comes now.
807
00:
-Tony, hi.
-It's Eddie, sir.
808
00:
I'm Detective Martin,
this is Detective Goldberg.
809
00:
We're investigating a car accident.
Maybe you heard about it.

Page 81/168

810
00:
Yes! On television.
811
00:
Last night. My wife...
812
00:
We said, "We have a Mercedes
and the license starts with 'R.'"
813
00:
You and a lot of people.
814
00:
Going up?
815
00:
Yeah. Yes, yes, I will.
816
00:
Should we...?
817
00:
-Is it bad time for you?
-No, no...
818
00:
We just have a few questions.
819
00:
-Was your car in use the night it happened?
-When?
820

Page 82/168

00:
Tuesday, a week ago.
821
00:
Let me think.
822
00:
Anybody else use your car?
823
00:
My wife sometimes.
824
00:
The men at the garage.
825
00:
Parking garage? You leave your car
and they park it?
826
00:
Can we go see it?
827
00:
The car? Now?
828
00:
Since we're here.
There's certain things to look for.
829
00:
We don't find them, we're out of your hair.
830
00:

Page 83/168

So you want to look at the car?
831
00:
I see. I see.
832
00:
We don't have a description of a driver,
so we have to look for the car.
833
00:
We're sorry for the inconvenience,
but it's routine.
834
00:
I understand.
835
00:
But if there is a routine,
then I ought to follow the routine...
836
00:
that's appropriate to me,
to someone with a car in this situation.
837
00:
You see?
838
00:
No, I don't follow.
839
00:
If there's a routine
in an investigation like this...
840

Page 84/168

00:
there must also be a routine
for a person like me.
841
00:
For the owner of a car
with a license number.
842
00:
That's what I need to consider.
843
00:
The routine.
844
00:
We just want to look at your car.
845
00:
That's what I mean. You see?
846
00:
No.
847
00:
Excuse me, Mr. McCoy.
848
00:
Do you want to tell us something?
849
00:
No.
850
00:
How do you mean?

Page 85/168

851
00:
I mean, if there is,
now is the time to tell us.
852
00:
Before things get complicated.
853
00:
No, no, no...
854
00:
I just think that to be certain...
855
00:
to be safe, sure, I think--
856
00:
If you want to cooperate, that'd be great.
857
00:
If you have a reason not to cooperate...
858
00:
you don't have to say anything.
That's your right.
859
00:
If you want, you can say nothing at all.
860
00:
You also have the right to an attorney.
861

Page 86/168

00:
For that matter...
862
00:
if you lack funds for an attorney...
863
00:
the state will provide you
with one free of charge.
864
00:
If that's what you wanted.
865
00:
I think what I should do is...
866
00:
talk to an attorney.
867
00:
So I casually read him
his rights.
868
00:
Then he sits down
on the guy's desk.
869
00:
And his eyes get bigger
and he starts double-talking like crazy.
870
00:
I know that there's something there.
871

Page 87/168

00:
Mr. Weiss, I think we got him.
872
00:
Got who?
873
00:
Sherman McCoy. We got him.
874
00:
You think it's him?
875
00:
It's him! This guy is Park Avenue.
876
00:
His father ran Dunning, Sponget and Leach.
His wife is a socialite.
877
00:
Does this put an end
to this white-justice shit?
878
00:
We have zip on him.
879
00:
We could bring him in for questioning,
then go public.
880
00:
Go public? With what?
The only witness is in a coma, likely to die.
881

Page 88/168

00:
Don't listen. You got a speech to make.
882
00:
Send a signal to the poor people
of the city.
883
00:
Let them know justice is blind.
884
00:
Let them know that rich whites
get the same treatment as poor blacks.
885
00:
You must give the people hope.
886
00:
You mean, we nail the WASP?
887
00:
To the wall.
888
00:
I like this man.
889
00:
So I tell him, "I'm your lawyer
from Legal Aid."
890
00:
He says, "I don't want a nigger lawyer.
I want a Jew."
891

Page 89/168

00:
Nice guy.
892
00:
-It's his third drug arrest. He wants a deal.
-He'll say he was at the scene?
893
00:
He'll say whatever you want him to say.
894
00:
Get me Andruitti. Tell him it's urgent
about this Lamb shit.
895
00:
Suppose this other fellow comes forward.
There was another fellow. He was big--
896
00:
I believe you. It was a set-up.
They were going to rob you.
897
00:
He has good reasons not to come forward.
898
00:
Now, you just sit tight.
899
00:
Look, you were recommended
as the best criminal lawyer around.
900
00:
But I didn't come here to...
901

Page 90/168

00:
I want to preempt this situation.
I don't want it to go any further.
902
00:
What does that mean?
903
00:
I want to take the initiative.
904
00:
I want to go to the police with Maria...
905
00:
with Mrs. Ruskin,
and tell them what happened.
906
00:
I feel morally certain
that what we did was right...
907
00:
in the circumstances we were in.
908
00:
Yeah, you Wall Street honchos
are real gamblers.
909
00:
What are you, nuts?
910
00:
They will devour you.
911

Page 91/168

00:
-Eat you alive.
-Why?
912
00:
Forget that it's a political football.
913
00:
Forget about the TV and Reverend Bacon...
914
00:
and Weiss's upcoming election.
915
00:
Remember that everyday, the Bronx DA
prosecutes people with names...
916
00:
like Tiffany Latour, Sancho Rodriguez...
917
00:
Chong Wong and Shabazz Tamali.
918
00:
So he's dying to get his hands on a nice
white couple like you and Mrs. Ruskin.
919
00:
I mean, Biscuit City.
920
00:
Open your mouth and they will arrest you.
921

Page 92/168

00:
They will make a big show of the arrest.
It will be very unpleasant. Guaranteed.
922
00:
And you don't want to be arrested
in the South Bronx.
923
00:
Put him on.
924
00:
I'll hold.
925
00:
I'll need to talk to Mrs. Ruskin too.
926
00:
I understand you went to Yale.
927
00:
Yeah. You too?
928
00:
What did you think of it?
929
00:
It was okay, as law schools go.
930
00:
They give you the scholarly view.
931
00:
And it's good for anything you want to do

Page 93/168

that doesn't involve real people.
932
00:
Andruitti, you guinea bastard!
933
00:
I'm sitting here with Mr. Sherman McCoy.
934
01:
I don't know if he needs a lawyer.
What do you think?
935
01:
Okay. So what does that mean?
936
01:
Yeah, yeah...
937
01:
We got a problem.
938
01:
What is it?
939
01:
They're going to arrest you.
940
01:
While Sherman faced catastrophe
in his career and in his marriage...
941
01:
and while the police were circling,
while his life hung in the balance...

Page 94/168

942
01:
Sherman went to the opera.
943
01:
There he is...
944
01:
Don Juan in the vise-like grip of fate...
945
01:
facing his crime, facing his entire life
of selfish consumption...
946
01:
and profligate wasting
of himself and others.
947
01:
You're Judy McCoy's husband.
948
01:
Yes.
949
01:
Have you met Aubrey Buffing, the poet?
950
01:
He's up for the Nobel Prize. He has AIDS.
951
01:
We were talking about the opera.
952

Page 95/168

01:
The wrath of heaven must be at hand.
953
01:
Itsjustice will not tarry.
954
01:
I see the deadly thunderbolt
poised above his head!
955
01:
Suddenly, he saw her in the crowd.
956
01:
Maria!
957
01:
He followed her past the grinning faces
full of boiling teeth.
958
01:
Past the conversational bouquets.
959
01:
Past the impeccably emaciated
ladies of society.
960
01:
The social X-ray women.
961
01:
Christ, was this the world he lived in?
962
01:

Page 96/168

Before he answered the question
he saw Maria being introduced...
963
01:
to his wife.
964
01:
Maria's just back from Italy.
965
01:
She lives on airplanes.
966
01:
She goes back and forth
from Italy like a Ping-Pong ball.
967
01:
Judy?
968
01:
Sherman!
969
01:
Have you met Nunnally Voyd?
970
01:
At last.
971
01:
Bobby Shalfet from the opera.
972
01:
And Arthur Ruskin.
973

Page 97/168

01:
And his wife, Maria.
974
01:
We've met.
975
01:
Couldn't you try just once
to be a little bit interesting?
976
01:
I wanted you to meet Aubrey Buffing.
977
01:
Aubrey Buffing.
He's on the short list for the Nobel Prize.
978
01:
He has AIDS. You'll love him.
979
01:
We are in the middle of the room,
a married couple talking to each other.
980
01:
You simply don't do it. Go mingle. Please.
981
01:
And even when
repentance is offered, he refuses.
982
01:
He refuses to deny his life.
983

Page 98/168

01:
The food, the drink, the flesh...
984
01:
fatal as they may be,
he cannot resist them.
985
01:
Maria, may I speak to you?
986
01:
We have to stop meeting like this.
987
01:
-Do you know Boris, the ballet dancer?
-No.
988
01:
-He's defective.
-You mean, he defected.
989
01:
No, I mean he doesn't speak English.
990
01:
Really? Are you sure?
991
01:
Do you know what's going on?
992
01:
Boris, want me to eat your ass?
993

Page 99/168

01:
You see? It went right over his head.
994
01:
-We have to talk.
-Of course we do.
995
01:
But keep smiling because
my husband is watching.
996
01:
He's so pleased with himself.
997
01:
He'sjust closed a new deal.
Charter business. He'll fly Arabs to Mecca.
998
01:
-I'm going to be arrested.
-The planes are from Israel.
999
01:
By the police.
1000
01:
He'll make a Goddamn fortune.
1001
01:
My lawyer, if you can call him that--
1002
01:
He called me a whore today!
Right in front of the servants!
1003

Page 100/168

01:
Really! How does he expect me
to run the house...
1004
01:
if he humiliates me in front of the help?
1005
01:
You have a point.
1006
01:
I'm sorry. What are we talking about?
1007
01:
The other guy's come forward.
Says I was driving.
1008
01:
I'm going to be arrested tomorrow.
1009
01:
I need to know from you
what you want me to say.
1010
01:
Maria, darling, I need your advice
about something.
1011
01:
Sherman, have you met Aubrey Buffing?
1012
01:
Like so many of us...
1013

Page 101/168

01:
until Death itself takes us into his arms
and burns us with the fever of living...
1014
01:
dragging us like Don Juan
into the bonfires of hell!
1015
01:
The voice of the ghost ringing in our ears!
1016
01:
"Repent!"
1017
01:
Careful. My kid got Styrofoam shit
back there and it sticks to your clothes.
1018
01:
-How do you feel?
-Top notch.
1019
01:
This is just a formality, right?
1020
01:
No problem. They promised me.
1021
01:
I told Maria. I saw her last night.
In case we need her.
1022
01:
That explains it.

Page 102/168

She left the country this morning.
1023
01:
You know an Italian painter
named Filippo Chirazzi?
1024
01:
I think your girlfriend's
got a new boyfriend.
1025
01:
It won't be so bad. This is routine.
1026
01:
Andruitti promised we'll be in
and out of there.
1027
01:
No one will ever know what happened.
1028
01:
Cuff him.
1029
01:
What?
1030
01:
The zone captain will be there.
And the press.
1031
01:
What the fuck? What press?
1032
01:

Page 103/168

Ray promised no bullshit.
1033
01:
Weiss gave the order this morning.
1034
01:
Somebody's going to pay for this.
1035
01:
I made sure I was there that day.
1036
01:
That day would be full of revelations.
1037
01:
I would meet Sherman McCoy at last.
1038
01:
When he finally appeared...
1039
01:
Well, excuse me, what the hell...?
1040
01:
Who were these people?
What were they doing here?
1041
01:
This was my story!
1042
01:
Sherman McCoy was my baby!
My creation!
1043

Page 104/168

01:
Look at these punks.
Get out of here!
1044
01:
Why'd you hit that kid?
1045
01:
Put the cuffs on him.
1046
01:
I'm going to jail, aren't I?
1047
01:
Don't say a word. Don't hide your head.
1048
01:
You don't even know they're there.
1049
01:
I'm going to jail.
1050
01:
What do you have
to say for yourself?
1051
01:
You been arrested before?
1052
01:
Where's your wife?
1053
01:

Page 105/168

You ran down Mrs. Lamb's son.
Have you anything to say to her?
1054
01:
Here! Let me take your picture, shithead!
1055
01:
How do you like this cocktail party?
1056
01:
Hello, Mr. McCoy.
1057
01:
Don't make any statements!
Don't talk to anybody!
1058
01:
I'll meet you at the arraignment.
1059
01:
Quiet! You people sit down!
1060
01:
Shut up!
1061
01:
Mr. McCoy...
1062
01:
do you know the charges
that have been brought against you?
1063
01:
What?

Page 106/168

1064
01:
How do you plead to the charges?
1065
01:
I'm sorry.
1066
01:
I am very sorry. Please forgive me.
1067
01:
Order!
1068
01:
I am truly sorry for everything.
Please forgive me.
1069
01:
For my life. For everything.
1070
01:
I'm truly sorry.
1071
01:
Shut up!
1072
01:
The defendant pleads not guilty.
1073
01:
Bail has been set at $10,000.
1074
01:

Page 107/168

Order! Order!
1075
01:
You people sit down!
1076
01:
We do not believe it will serve
the interests of justice...
1077
01:
to allow this man to walk free...
1078
01:
on a token bail.
1079
01:
Mr. Kramer knows perfectly well
that my client won't jump bail!
1080
01:
Think of the emotions of this community!
1081
01:
That is patent nonsense.
Bail has already been agreed to.
1082
01:
Mr. Weiss has instructed me to ask
for bail in the amount of $250,000.
1083
01:
Cash!
1084
01:

Page 108/168

Order!
1085
01:
If your office has any information
bearing on bail status of this case...
1086
01:
make a formal application.
1087
01:
Meanwhile, I release Mr. McCoy...
1088
01:
under a bond in the amount of $10,000.
1089
01:
Now get this sideshow out of my court!
1090
01:
Your Honor, your action will irreparably
damage not only the people's case...
1091
01:
I have spoken!
1092
01:
...but the people's cause as well.
1093
01:
Mr. Kramer!
1094
01:
It ill-behooves the criminal justice system!
1095

Page 109/168

01:
Kindly behoove me no "ill-behooves."
1096
01:
The court directs you to shut up!
1097
01:
He's coming out the back!
Fall out! He's coming out the back!
1098
01:
Go get him!
1099
01:
Get him.
1100
01:
He's getting away!
1101
01:
He's getting away.
1102
01:
So much for my introduction
to Sherman McCoy.
1103
01:
Before we could even speak,
he had been swept away.
1104
01:
I began to appreciate the power,
the magnitude...
1105

Page 110/168

01:
the sheer force unleashed
by my little story.
1106
01:
Jackals.
1107
01:
These dogs...
1108
01:
yapping at the heels of their prey.
1109
01:
And my God, I was one of them.
1110
01:
Let them have it. Enough is enough.
1111
01:
With what little dignity I had left,
I decided to go home.
1112
01:
Excuse me. Do you know
where I can find a taxi?
1113
01:
Sherman McCoy.
1114
01:
Yeah, I know who you are.
1115

Page 111/168

01:
-What are you doing out here?
-I need a taxi.
1116
01:
There he is! There's McCoy!
1117
01:
You need to get out of here. Come on.
1118
01:
We'll get out of here
on the subway.
1119
01:
I don't usually travel in the subway.
1120
01:
I owe you an apology.
1121
01:
No, you were very helpful.
1122
01:
-You don't know who I am.
-It's all right. Thanks.
1123
01:
I should go.
1124
01:
Go where? You're on a train.
1125
01:

Page 112/168

Come over here and sit down.
1126
01:
I'll make sure you get home.
1127
01:
-Want some?
-No thanks.
1128
01:
Fuck it.
1129
01:
What'll they do?
1130
01:
Arrest you?
1131
01:
Does this train go
anywhere near Park Avenue?
1132
01:
Not for the last million years.
1133
01:
My father rode the subway
every day of his life.
1134
01:
He didn't live in the South Bronx, though.
1135
01:
No...

Page 113/168

1136
01:
I look terrible.
1137
01:
You look like shit.
1138
01:
You don't smell good, either.
1139
01:
I think when I was in jail
I pissed in my pants.
1140
01:
Take it easy.
1141
01:
I'm all right.
1142
01:
I can't think.
1143
01:
Cheer yourself up.
1144
01:
Thank you.
1145
01:
Your welcome.
1146
01:

Page 114/168

Then this newspaper thing started.
This Peter Fallow.
1147
01:
Everything was wrong.
Total disregard for the truth.
1148
01:
This is your stop.
1149
01:
Everyone calls me by my first name,
like they know me. Like they own me.
1150
01:
Lawyers, police, newspapers.
How did I get to be so important?
1151
01:
You're not important. You're dinner.
Don't you get it?
1152
01:
A week from now,
they won't even remember what they ate.
1153
01:
Thank you for everything.
1154
01:
I should have just called the police
right away. Right when it happened.
1155
01:
But it really wasn't my decision to make.

Page 115/168

1156
01:
I wasn't driving the car.
1157
01:
Stand clear of the doors, please.
1158
01:
Sherman, wait a minute!
1159
01:
It's going to be fine.
1160
01:
-What do we want?
-Justice!
1161
01:
-What do we get?
-Racism!
1162
01:
It's Sherman! A bravo, everybody!
1163
01:
You sly fox. Don't let the newspapers
keep you down.
1164
01:
The press are bloody fruit flies.
1165
01:
They hover over the feces.
Just swipe them away.

Page 116/168

1166
01:
But they always come back to the shit.
1167
01:
I always thought you were dull.
1168
01:
Congratulations.
1169
01:
Has anybody talked to you
about television?
1170
01:
We'd have to play down the racial thing.
1171
01:
Kind of make you more sympathetic.
1172
01:
I know I'm first, but I wanted to be there
before the corpse was cold.
1173
01:
$200,000.
1174
01:
-I beg your pardon?
-Fuck my pardon.
1175
01:
I'll suck your dick for the rights. $250,000.
1176

Page 117/168

01:
A book, a mini-series. $500,000.
Go to jail, double.
1177
01:
-Is that a great blow job or what?
-Excuse me!
1178
01:
Didn't mean anything to interrupt anything.
1179
01:
Gene asked me to come by.
1180
01:
I haven't talked with anyone yet.
1181
01:
If there's anything we can do...
1182
01:
I'll be back to work in a day or two.
1183
01:
That won't be necessary.
That's what I was sent to...
1184
01:
You don't have to.
1185
01:
I mean, you shouldn't come down.
1186

Page 118/168

01:
They don't want you to come down.
1187
01:
Sherman, I'm sorry.
1188
01:
Between this and the way you handled
the Giscard deal...
1189
01:
-I mean, $600,000,000 is a--
-This is final?
1190
01:
Well, the firm feels that...
1191
01:
I'm sorry.
1192
01:
Judy, could we...
What's going on?
1193
01:
This dinner party was planned weeks ago,
if you bothered to check your calendar.
1194
01:
Under the circumstances--
1195
01:
I know the whole story.
I saw it on television.
1196

Page 119/168

01:
I'm sorry. Judy, I am.
1197
01:
You betrayed us. Me. Campbell.
Even yourself.
1198
01:
But I'm chairing the museum benefit
thanks to your escapades.
1199
01:
What can I say? Life goes on.
1200
01:
I'll make the best
of an appalling situation.
1201
01:
Can you forgive me?
1202
01:
I suppose I can forgive anything,
but not television.
1203
01:
I'm leaving you.
1204
01:
After the party.
1205
01:
Now if you will excuse me,
we have guests.

Page 120/168

1206
01:
I'm terribly sorry to bother you.
Is this a bad time?
1207
01:
No.
1208
01:
The more the merrier.
1209
01:
I've been in touch with the co-op board.
1210
01:
We want you to know
you have our support.
1211
01:
Oh, thank you!
1212
01:
You know, I wanted to die...
1213
01:
with everybody calling my name
in that courtroom.
1214
01:
Of course. It's hard to believe.
1215
01:
And then I thought, "I have a gun."
1216

Page 121/168

01:
A 12-gauge, pump action.
1217
01:
We've known each other a long time.
1218
01:
We went to Buckley together.
My father knew your father.
1219
01:
I speak as a friend and also for the board.
1220
01:
How do I get the barrels into my mouth?
1221
01:
How am I going to pull the trigger?
1222
01:
I read about a man who took off his shoe...
1223
01:
and pulled the trigger with his toe.
1224
01:
This can't be a comfortable situation
for you.
1225
01:
Is that a gun?
1226
01:

Page 122/168

Where would I do it?
1227
01:
And who would find me?
1228
01:
Yes, exactly.
1229
01:
Have you considered...
1230
01:
changing residence for a while?
1231
01:
You want me to leave?
1232
01:
This is my home.
1233
01:
I have no safe place to go.
People are threatening my life.
1234
01:
I must protect myself.
1235
01:
People are demonstrating out front.
Black people with basketballs.
1236
01:
You're putting everyone at risk!
1237

Page 123/168

01:
It's not your fault. But that's the fact.
1238
01:
If you're so scared, you move out.
1239
01:
Please.
1240
01:
Start...
1241
01:
by moving out of my apartment now.
1242
01:
I came here in good faith.
1243
01:
Now, out!
1244
01:
You were a fat blowhard at Buckley...
1245
01:
and you're a fat blowhard now!
1246
01:
I'll enforce the provision
on unacceptable situations.
1247
01:
Another word and you'll have

Page 124/168

an unacceptable situation up your ass!
1248
01:
March!
1249
01:
That goes for the rest of you too! Out!
1250
01:
I said, "Get out!"
1251
01:
Parasites! Everybody out!
1252
01:
Out of my house! Out of my apartment!
1253
01:
Out of my life!
1254
01:
Sherman McCoy is dead!
1255
01:
Sherman McCoy of Park Avenue
and Wall Street...
1256
01:
will never be Sherman McCoy again!
1257
01:
Meanwhile,just a few blocks away,
I was being praised and congratulated.
1258

Page 125/168

01:
It should have been
a triumphant yours truly...
1259
01:
but it wasn't.
1260
01:
My encounter with the real
Sherman McCoy was spoiling everything.
1261
01:
Truth has a way of doing that.
1262
01:
Daddy, dinner.
1263
01:
-Yes. Shall we take Peter with us?
-Lovely.
1264
01:
Pay full attention to this story.
1265
01:
We look better and better
the more we do for the Lambs.
1266
01:
These poor little Lambs.
1267
01:
These fuzzy-wuzzy little wogs!
1268

Page 126/168

01:
Phone call for you in the office.
1269
01:
Thank you. I'm expecting a call
about the story.
1270
01:
I'll see you at dinner. Thank you.
1271
01:
Where's the phone?
1272
01:
I lied.
1273
01:
I wanted to see you alone.
1274
01:
I'm going to do you a favor.
1275
01:
Does this mean I'll finally get
into your panties?
1276
01:
You don't deserve this, Peter.
1277
01:
I'm going to tell you
something.
1278

Page 127/168

01:
I'm with some people right outside.
1279
01:
Relax, darling.
1280
01:
Do you remember...
1281
01:
my pretty little Italian friend?
The painter.
1282
01:
Frederico. No. Franco.
1283
01:
Filippo.
1284
01:
The shit.
1285
01:
You are very intoxicated.
1286
01:
Filippo has run off with a little slut
you should know about.
1287
01:
Isn't that dangerous?
1288
01:
At the very least, unsanitary?

Page 128/168

1289
01:
Shut up, Peter.
1290
01:
You're not listening.
1291
01:
Her name is Maria Ruskin.
1292
01:
She was subletting my apartment.
1293
01:
She was also subletting Filippo.
1294
01:
As it turns out...
1295
01:
she was in the car with Sherman McCoy
when he had his little mishap.
1296
01:
You're joking.
1297
01:
I never joke.
1298
01:
She was in the bloody car.

How do you know?
1300
01:
The apartment was bugged.
1301
01:
They had a wire in the intercom.
1302
01:
They wanted to prove
I wasn't living there.
1303
01:
Which I wasn't.
1304
01:
Now I've lost the apartment
and the boyfriend.
1305
01:
Do you know where they are?
1306
01:
No.
1307
01:
I am trusting you to find them.
1308
01:
When you do...
1309
01:
give them this.
1310

Page 130/168

01:
Tell them it's from the little twat
who turned them in.
1311
01:
Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice, Mr. Ruskin.
1312
01:
Peter Fallow.
1313
01:
I'm a good friend of your wife.
1314
01:
My wife. My wife.
1315
01:
I'm glad she's not here.
Otherwise I couldn't have a drink.
1316
01:
A Courvoisier VSOP. Put it in a sidecar.
1317
01:
Where is Maria?
1318
01:
Italy. She's always in Italy.
1319
01:
She's young. She needs young people.
1320

Page 131/168

01:
I know what goes on.
1321
01:
I'll want to talk to her.
1322
01:
My office has her number.
1323
01:
I'm not supposed to drink,
but I love a sidecar.
1324
01:
So you're on The City Light?
1325
01:
We're profiling the new tycoons.
Naturally, we thought of you.
1326
01:
Good. Good. I like that.
1327
01:
New tycoons. What do you want to know?
1328
01:
The best one happened
a few weeks ago.
1329
01:
My jackass pilot lands long
and the plane goes off the runway.
1330

Page 132/168

01:
I was on the plane.
1331
01:
We were going to Mecca.
The plane is full of Arabs with animals.
1332
01:
Goats, sheep, chickens. They don't
go anywhere without their animals.
1333
01:
We had to put plastic in the cabins.
They urinate, they defecate.
1334
01:
Anyway, the plane goes off the runway
and lands into that sand with a jolt!
1335
01:
The right wing tip digs into the sand
and spins around in a circle.
1336
01:
Three hundred and sixty degrees.
I'm scared shitless. Panic!
1337
01:
I look in the cabin. In there, calm, quiet...
1338
01:
they're picking up their luggage
and animals...
1339
01:

Page 133/168

and looking out the window
at a little fire on the wings.
1340
01:
They're waiting for the doors
to open like nothing happened!
1341
01:
Then it dawns on me.
1342
01:
They think it's normal!
1343
01:
That's how you stop a plane!
1344
01:
Stick the wing in the sand
and let it spin until it stops!
1345
01:
They'd never been on a plane before!
What do they know?
1346
01:
They think this is how you do it!
1347
01:
Mr. Ruskin?
1348
01:
Mrs. Ruskin?
1349
01:

Page 134/168

I'm Peter Fallow.
I want to express my sympathies.
1350
01:
How very kind.
1351
01:
Did you know Arthur?
1352
01:
Actually, I was quite close to him
when he died.
1353
01:
I have reprobated myself,
over and over again, for not being there.
1354
01:
I understand that
you're Sherman McCoy's lover.
1355
01:
Excuse me?
1356
01:
And that you were driving the car
on the night of that unfortunate accident.
1357
01:
-Sherman would never tell you that.
-Tell me what happened that night.
1358
01:
Listen, Mr. Peckerhead.
1359

Page 135/168

01:
I am here for my husband's funeral.
Understand?
1360
01:
Go away. Disappear. Disintegrate.
1361
01:
Yes, yes, yes.
This story was getting better every day.
1362
01:
I could smell it.
1363
01:
Hell, some of it was even true.
1364
01:
I was back on track.
I was a reporter again.
1365
01:
You're a muckraking yellow journalist!
1366
01:
You print this story without so much
as a by-your-leave to me or the Reverend.
1367
01:
Who do you think you are?
1368
01:
For chrissakes, calm down.
1369

Page 136/168

01:
You have to keep
your voices down.
1370
01:
Sherman McCoy was not driving the car.
I think I can prove it.
1371
01:
So what?
1372
01:
This is our case. Right here.
The hospital is the guilty party.
1373
01:
The hospital?
1374
01:
The hospital. A young man comes in
with a cerebral concussion.
1375
01:
They treat him for a broken wrist.
1376
01:
That is our case. That is the lawsuit
we'll bring against the hospital.
1377
01:
That is what we have been
working toward all this time.
1378
01:

Page 137/168

And you are confusing the issue.
1379
01:
What about Sherman McCoy?
1380
01:
What about the truth?
1381
01:
Congratulations.
1382
01:
You're a reporter again.
1383
01:
Don't forget where your story came from.
1384
01:
That's right.
You our boy, Peter.
1385
01:
You take care of us
and we'll take care of you.
1386
01:
I promise you that is going
to be a very profitable relationship...
1387
01:
for all of us.
1388
01:
Annie, I know nothing can heal

Page 138/168

the wound that you've suffered.
1389
01:
But $10,000,000 in damages
will make your grief more comfortable.
1390
01:
I could use a few things.
1391
01:
I feel that the presentation of my person
should be carefully designed.
1392
01:
I think I should have the right wardrobe.
1393
01:
So if Mr. Fox's limousine could pick me up
tomorrow morning...
1394
01:
I could do some shopping.
1395
01:
Certainly.
1396
01:
I printed the story they wanted.
1397
01:
If you work in a whorehouse,
there's only one thing to be.
1398
01:

Page 139/168

The best whore in the house.
1399
01:
And I was beginning to see
even greater possibilities in my situation.
1400
01:
They're going to sue the hospital.
1401
01:
All they want is money.
1402
01:
Can you imagine using a tragedy like this
for your own selfish motives?
1403
01:
It really is terrible.
1404
01:
Shut up, asshole!
1405
01:
What is happening to my campaign?
The People versus Sherman McCoy?
1406
01:
Where is my issue?
1407
01:
Where is my cause?
1408
01:
Where is my hope?

Page 140/168

1409
01:
We've got to talk to this Ruskin woman.
1410
01:
You go to the press. Tell them we're going
to question the woman.
1411
01:
If she's the woman in the car,
she faces possible charges, etc., etc.
1412
01:
And you!
1413
01:
Mr. Wise-Guy-Know-It-All-Shitface!
1414
01:
You got us into this!
You're going to get us out.
1415
01:
Look at me when I talk to you!
1416
01:
Go to this broad.
Tell her she's in a whole lot of trouble.
1417
01:
But, if she's willing to cooperate,
if she'll say what we want her to say...
1418
01:

Page 141/168

we will grant her immunity.
1419
01:
What are you waiting for? Go!
1420
01:
Today?
1421
01:
Her husband's funeral is today.
1422
01:
I don't care if today is
her mother's bar mitzvah.
1423
01:
Go to her. Now!
1424
01:
I hear you did some creative wiring
in the building.
1425
01:
You bugged
Caroline Heftshank's apartment.
1426
01:
In three minutes,
I had what I needed.
1427
01:
It was more than a story.
I had the makings of a book.
1428

Page 142/168

01:
A great book. A prize-winning effort.
1429
01:
All I needed was a finish.
1430
01:
-Do you have the tape upstairs?
-I got it.
1431
01:
I shipped off a present
to McCoy's lawyer...
1432
01:
and waited for the fireworks.
1433
01:
I don't feel
terrifically sexy at the moment.
1434
01:
You know I'm a sucker
for a soft dick, Sherman.
1435
01:
You are incorrigible.
1436
01:
That is me! That's Maria!
Where did you get this?
1437
01:
Listen!
1438

Page 143/168

01:
We could still go to the police.
We could get a talented lawyer.
1439
01:
And put our heads right
into the tiger's mouth?
1440
01:
I'm the one who was driving the car.
1441
01:
Shouldn't I be the one
to make that decision?
1442
01:
And I say no. I say no.
1443
01:
The apartment was wired?
It was bugged all that time?
1444
01:
Why?
1445
01:
Who knows?
1446
01:
Whoever sent this tape is either a fan
of yours or not a fan of Maria's.
1447
01:
Then we have this as evidence!

Page 144/168

1448
01:
This tape is illegal. Totally illegal.
1449
01:
The guy who did this could go to jail.
1450
01:
If this were your tape, it'd be legal.
1451
01:
But it's not.
1452
01:
If it were my tape?
1453
01:
If you recorded your own conversation...
1454
01:
it would be okay.
1455
01:
But this tape can't be used as evidence
in a court of law.
1456
01:
Then what good is it?
1457
01:
-It gave me an idea.
-What kind of idea?
1458

Page 145/168

01:
About what you wear to the funeral.
1459
01:
What funeral?
1460
01:
Please be seated.
1461
01:
In accordance with the wishes
of Mr. Ruskin...
1462
01:
Manny Leerman will play a medley
of Arthur's favorite songs.
1463
01:
It's me. Sherman.
1464
01:
I need to talk to you.
Can you come?
1465
01:
What are you doing here?
1466
01:
I had to talk to you.
1467
01:
Sherman, it seems like you've been doing
all your talking to the newspapers.
1468

Page 146/168

01:
I had nothing to do with it.
We didn't want your name brought up.
1469
01:
I see.
1470
01:
Maria, you have to help me.
1471
01:
How can I help you?
1472
01:
This may sound strange,
but you could start by...
1473
01:
telling the police
what really happened that night.
1474
01:
Sherman, you are the sweetest thing.
1475
01:
I'm not sure anybody knows
what really happened that night.
1476
01:
Not anymore.
1477
01:
Oh, God! Oh, God!
1478

Page 147/168

01:
There's something about funerals
that is so stimulating.
1479
01:
My panties have been wet all morning.
1480
01:
Maria, stop.
1481
01:
What's wrong with you?
Why are you all hunched over?
1482
01:
What's on your back?
1483
01:
This lump, this piece of metal.
1484
01:
-That's my belt buckle.
-You don't have a buckle in the back.
1485
01:
There's subterfuge afoot!
1486
01:
You're secreting something on
your body! I want to see what it is!
1487
01:
A hidden microphone? A wire!
1488

Page 148/168

01:
Sherman!
1489
01:
You rotten, dishonest bastard!
1490
01:
I didn't want to do it!
You gave me no choice!
1491
01:
Mrs. Ruskin?
1492
01:
Go away, whoever you are!
1493
01:
I'm so sorry. I'm Jed Kramer,
of the district attorney's office.
1494
01:
District attorney's office.
1495
01:
My, my, my, Mr. McCoy.
1496
01:
I'd say your goose is just about home-fried.
1497
01:
I have protected you.
I have been a gentleman about this.
1498
01:

Page 149/168

I've tried to keep your name out of the
papers. Now you must do the right thing!
1499
01:
Never. Never! Never!
1500
01:
I hope you die and hang
in the electric chair!
1501
01:
Mrs. Ruskin,
I apologize for the intrusion...
1502
01:
He's gone!
1503
01:
I know. And I'm sorry for your loss.
1504
01:
He just ran out the back door!
1505
01:
-Who?
-Sherman McCoy!
1506
01:
Jesus!
1507
01:
I'm sorry if I alarmed you,
but he was acting very strange.
1508

Page 150/168

01:
Where are my manners?
My name is Maria Ruskin.
1509
01:
I'm Kramer.
1510
01:
Jed Kramer.
1511
01:
I'm the assistant district attorney.
1512
01:
Bronx County.
1513
01:
I see.
1514
01:
What a handsome district attorney you are.
1515
01:
We have a lot to talk about.
1516
01:
Because if I'm going to testify...
1517
01:
I need to know what I should
or should not say.
1518
01:
You can start by telling the police...

Page 151/168

1519
01:
what really happened that night.
1520
01:
Sherman,
you are the sweetest thing.
1521
01:
I'm not sure anybody knows
what really happened.
1522
01:
Not anymore.
1523
01:
They weren't sure downstairs
if you were here.
1524
01:
I usually come up the back way now.
1525
01:
I see. May I?
1526
01:
Yes. Yeah, sure.
1527
01:
It's all gone. Everything.
1528
01:
Judy's gone too?
1529

Page 152/168

01:
Yes.
1530
01:
She moves quickly.
1531
01:
She's got a good lawyer.
1532
01:
I'm not sure I ever really liked her,
your wife.
1533
01:
No, of course not.
1534
01:
Or this apartment, for what you paid for it.
1535
01:
Or the furniture--
1536
01:
Or my car, or my job,
or my clothes, my life, my money!
1537
01:
Christ! You did not come
all the way here...
1538
01:
on a fucking subway to tell me...
1539

Page 153/168

01:
I am not...
1540
01:
at this late date, going to get
the ethics and morality speech!
1541
01:
Not now! Not when I have to do what
I'm going to do in court tomorrow.
1542
01:
If you came to give me that...
Jesus Christ!
1543
01:
I don't know how to do this.
1544
01:
You didn't call. We wanted to help.
1545
01:
I came to say that we're here for you.
1546
01:
You're our son and we love you.
1547
01:
I don't mean "we."
1548
01:
I mean "I."
1549
01:

Page 154/168

I love you.
1550
01:
That's all.
1551
01:
Please.
1552
01:
Have you thought about
what you want to do?
1553
01:
There's only one thing I can do.
1554
01:
I want the truth to come out
and burn every one of them.
1555
01:
There's only one way to do that.
1556
01:
Lie.
1557
01:
I have always been a great believer
in the truth.
1558
01:
I've lived my life as honestly as I can.
1559
01:
I believe in the truth as an essential

Page 155/168

companion to a man of conscience.
1560
01:
A beacon in this vast and dark
wasteland that is our modern world.
1561
01:
And yet...
1562
01:
Yes?
1563
01:
In this case,
if the truth won't set you free...
1564
01:
then lie.
1565
01:
Did this incident take place
on the ramp to the expressway...
1566
01:
or on the avenue itself?
1567
01:
On the avenue. Right on the street.
1568
01:
Was there a barricade,
or an obstruction of any kind...
1569
01:

Page 156/168

that forced the car to stop?
1570
01:
No, there was nothing like that at all.
1571
01:
Just one last question.
1572
01:
Who was driving the car
when Henry Lamb was hit?
1573
01:
Sherman never let anyone drive his car.
1574
01:
So, Sherman McCoy was driving the car?
1575
01:
Yes.
1576
01:
Lock him up! Bang it shut!
Lock him up! Bang it shut!
1577
01:
Chill, everybody. Chill!
1578
01:
And there it was.
1579
01:
The end of Sherman McCoy.
1580

Page 157/168

01:
It wasn't the ending I was hoping for.
1581
01:
All my work, all my efforts,
down the tubes.
1582
01:
My hero was gone. Finished.
1583
01:
Maria might as well have put a gun
to his head and pulled the trigger.
1584
01:
She and everyone in this courtroom.
1585
01:
I saw a wave of triumph wash over them.
1586
01:
I could feel them rising like the tide
as Sherman sank before them.
1587
01:
The Master of the Universe was
going down for the third time.
1588
01:
It was all over.
1589
01:
There was no hope now.
1590

Page 158/168

01:
The darkness closed in around him.
1591
01:
And then I noticed a peculiar thing.
1592
01:
Sherman was smiling.
1593
01:
You people settle down!
1594
01:
I will have you all thrown out!
1595
01:
You are out of order!
1596
01:
Order in here! Order!
1597
01:
Order!
1598
01:
Go on, Mrs. Ruskin.
1599
01:
And I wanted...
1600
01:
to report the incident,
but he wouldn't let me.

Page 159/168

1601
01:
He said that he was driving...
1602
01:
and that it was his decision to make.
1603
01:
And did that surprise you?
1604
01:
I was shocked.
1605
01:
There are certain qualities of virtue
that I admire in a human being.
1606
01:
Virtues that I hope...
1607
01:
I possess myself.
1608
01:
We have time
for a quickie.
1609
01:
What do you say?
1610
01:
I don't feel
terrifically sexy at the moment.

01:
You know I'm a sucker
for a soft dick, Sherman.
1612
01:
You are incorrigible.
1613
01:
We could still go to the police.
We could get a talented lawyer.
1614
01:
And put our heads
into the tiger's mouth?
1615
01:
I'm the one who was driving the car.
1616
01:
Order!
1617
01:
Order in here, Goddamn it! Order!
1618
01:
Approach the bench.
1619
01:
Now, gentlemen.
1620
01:
Damn it.
1621

01:
That can't be used.
1622
01:
-Whose tape is this?
-Mine.
1623
01:
Shut up!
1624
01:
I remind you that you are still under oath.
1625
01:
Did you record this conversation?
1626
01:
Yes, sir, I did.
1627
01:
I recorded the conversation on this tape.
1628
01:
My tape. This is my tape...
1629
01:
of my conversation.
1630
01:
I recorded it.
1631
01:
Get out of my face.
1632

Page 162/168

01:
All of you!
1633
01:
You can't let them get away with this!
1634
01:
Order!
1635
01:
Order in the court!
1636
01:
You insist on testing the will of this court?
1637
01:
Now shut up and sit down!
1638
01:
Very well.
1639
01:
In the case of
The People versus Sherman McCoy...
1640
01:
based on the evidence contained
in this recording...
1641
01:
I order the indictment dismissed
in the interest of justice.
1642

Page 163/168

01:
That's not justice, you racist pig!
1643
01:
Racist?
1644
01:
You dare call me racist?
1645
01:
I say unto you...
1646
01:
what does it matter
the color of a man's skin...
1647
01:
if witnesses...
1648
01:
perjure themselves?
1649
01:
If a prosecutor...
1650
01:
enlists the perjurers?
1651
01:
When a district attorney...
1652
01:
throws a man to the mob...
1653

Page 164/168

01:
for political gain?
1654
01:
When men of the cloth...
1655
01:
men of God...
1656
01:
take the prime cuts?
1657
01:
Is that justice?
1658
01:
I don't hear you.
1659
01:
I'll tell you what justice is.
1660
01:
Justice...
1661
01:
is the law.
1662
01:
And the law...
1663
01:
is man's feeble attempt...
1664

Page 165/168

01:
to set down the principles of decency.
1665
01:
Decency.
1666
01:
And decency is not a deal!
1667
01:
It isn't an angle, or a contract or a hustle.
1668
01:
Decency...
1669
01:
Decency is what
your grandmother taught you.
1670
01:
It's in your bones.
1671
01:
Now you go home.
1672
01:
Go home and be decent people.
1673
01:
Be decent.
1674
01:
Mr. McCoy, you're free to go.

Page 166/168

1675
01:
I don't fucking believe this.
1676
01:
Shit!
1677
01:
So we come to the end
of our story.
1678
01:
That was the last I saw of Sherman McCoy.
1679
01:
The last anyone saw of him.
1680
01:
He was gone...
1681
01:
in a blaze of glory. A hero for our times.
1682
01:
Or as close to a hero
as we're likely to get these days.
1683
01:
And now, without further ado,
the man of the moment.
1684
01:
The winner of the Pulitzer Prize...
1685

Page 167/168

01:
the National Book Award
and every other prize you can win.
1686
01:
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Peter Fallow.
1687
01:
Sherman, who started with
so much, lost everything.
1688
01:
But he gained his soul.
1689
01:
Whereas I, who started with so little...
1690
01:
gained everything.
1691
01:
"But what does it profit a man
if he gains the world and loses..."
1692
01:
Ah, well.
1693
01:
There are compensations.
