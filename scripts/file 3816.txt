[astrophysicist]
The blue indicates water.

The red is oxygen.

This is our best chance
to find a habitable planet.

One we can colonize and so ensure
the survival of our species.

With the deteriorating situation
here on Earth,

it's essential we send a scouting mission
as soon as possible.

The voyage there will take 86 years.

So, the crew will reproduce
onboard the ship,

and their grandchildren
will be the ones who reach the planet.

[technician]
Nobel laureate in physics...

say hello to MIT bio-engineer.

[babies wailing]

Our first challenge was finding


able to cope with the stress
of prolonged confinement.

That and the knowledge
that they won't be coming back.

Our solution,
breed and raise our own crew.

Train them in isolation
so they won't miss Earth.

Then the next step is to assess
when they'll be ready to go.

The younger they are,
the longer we can conserve resources

and extend the timeline of the mission.

But they will be on the ship alone.

And while I have every confidence
in our education and management system,

I'm most concerned that they be able
to combat the dangers

they may face along the way.

Some we're just beginning to understand.

[keypad beeping]

[door whirring, hisses]

[automated voice]
Decontamination complete.

- Richard!
- [child 1] Richard!

[children shouting excitedly]

[Richard exclaims and chuckles]

[child 2] Richard.

[computers beeping]

How would you solve that one?

[computer trilling]

Good.

[Richard] Sleep well, Christopher.

Sleep well, Sela.

Sleep well, Zac.

I'm scared.

Of what?

I don't know.

There's nothing to be scared of.

You're safe.

[birds chirping]

[Richard] I want to go with them.

It's a one-way trip, Richard.
There's no coming back.

You'll die up there.

I'll die down here eventually.

Seems the same to me.

The whole reason
we're raising them this way

is for their mental health.

So they don't miss wide open spaces,
sunlight, people.

Now you, on the other hand,
are gonna have a hard time dealing with...

I wouldn't miss a thing.

It's not part of the plan.

I know, I know,
but think of it like this.

You'll be able to launch sooner
if I go with them.

Four years instead of seven.

Someone should be there to raise them.

To protect them.

You know I'm right.

[helicopter blades whirring]

[launch director on radio]
T-minus 15 seconds.

We are go for launch.


Switch from GLC to OBC.

...six, five...

- [ship launches]
- Go main engines.

...three, two, one...

- All right.
- [male technician] You good?

Yeah.

- Good luck.
- Thank you.

[automated voice]
Hatch closing.

[metal creaking]

[bell tolls]

[doors sliding]

[male automated voice] You are the link
between past and future generations

and have been entrusted
with the survival of our species.

You will have children
onboard the ship,

and your grandchildren
will be the ones to reach the planet.

[female automated voice]
On-ship reproduction will occur

via artificial fertilization
and incubation

during each generation's 24th year
in order to maximize resources.

[tray clatters]

[scanner beeps and trills]

[classical music playing over headphones]

[volume increases]

[Sela] Well, we're the first generation,
so we won't ever see the planet.

We'll never know what they discover.

That's true.

Our lives are unimportant.

No, your life,
my life is as important as anyone's.

Here or on Earth.

Let me show you something.

[keypad beeping]

Not supposed to let anyone see these.

That is my father and his parents.

My grandparents.

I never knew them,
but I know they lived an honest life.

You know, they took care of their family,
they provided for the future.

That's all any of us can do.

[metal creaking]

[creaking continues]

[alarm beeping]

What's up?

There's a toxin in the irrigation water.

Well, replace the filter
and test it again.

It's coming from us, it's in our urine.

Yeah, it's from something we've eaten.

Are we eating something toxic?

Maybe toxic for a plant
that relies solely on water,

but you're stronger than that.

What is it? What's the chemical?

I don't know. Just change that filter.

[Christopher] Hey.

What do you make of this?

It's an ingredient in something we eat.

Why would that be unavailable?

[softly] Let's go.

How'd you get past the firewall?

[Christopher]
By connecting directly to the processor.

It's the same way
I got into the design plans.

[Christopher sighs]

[beeping]

- Hmm.
- Try "Nutrition."

- It's not there.
- Is it some kind of vitamin?

Maybe... medication.

[Christopher] Here we go.

"...the active ingredient
in daily beverage A.02."

"Combine with blue alkaline syrup
to counter stomach irritation."

Blue.

It's the blue.

"...effect is enhanced
when consuming it with food."

What effect?

I thought it was just an enzyme
for digestion.

"...personality becomes dull
and docile..."

"...eliminates sexual desire
and sensation..."

"...decreased pleasure response..."

Decreased pleasure response?

I want increased pleasure.

[scoffs]

They're drugging us.

[Zac] So they can control us.

Pacify us.

They don't want us to reproduce naturally.

They don't want us
to have sexual relations.

So we don't feel what that feels like.

And so we don't overpopulate the ship.

To conserve food.

I don't care.

I'm not drinking it.

So, Richard lied to you.

The mission lies.

What else aren't they telling us?

Well, Christopher found
a hidden compartment.

In the ship's plans.

Where is it?

[computer beeping]

In Pod-23.

Unmarked behind a wall.

- What's inside?
- I don't know yet.

[Kai] Don't tell Richard
you went off the blue.

He's going to force them
back on it anyway.

Yeah, maybe.
By then, we'll know what it feels like.

What does it feel like?

Has anything changed since you stopped?

- Yes, but...
- Where's my pleasure?

[electricity crackles]

- [electricity crackles]
- [groans softly]

[both chuckle]

Here.

Ow.

[all chuckle]

[grunts and chuckles]

A little jolt.

- A bolt.
- A bite.

You know that's a waste of electricity.

Go away.

[Richard] So...

What have you been thinking about
since our last session?

Nothing.

Come on, nothing?

Well, I guess I was wondering
why do you lie to us?

What do you think I lied about?

Well, I found out that...

What?

There's an unmarked compartment.

Pod-23.

Well, mission withholds
certain information for various reasons.

You know, even-even from me.

It's not quite lying,
but I get what you mean.

How'd you find it?

I just did. What's inside?

I don't know.

I don't know.
It must be for the third generation.

But why's it hidden? Aren't you curious?

I am...

It's probably reserved for them.

It's... for your grandchildren.

That's a profound thought.

I mean, you're going to have children,
and you're going to have grandchildren.

What do you think about that?

[Richard] Yeah, they're normal kids.

They're sensitive and smart,

which means they know
when I'm not telling them the truth.

And that's my point.

I want to be honest with them
about everything.

Otherwise, they'll lose faith in me.

So...

I'm going to need a quick response
from you on this.

That's all for now.

[scanner trilling]

[heartbeat thuds]

[heartbeat fading]

Sela?

[Sela] What?

You look different.

I'm the same.

No, you're not. Neither am I.

What are you talking about?

I don't know. You've changed.

Everything about you.

Yeah, I've grown up.

That's exactly what
I want to talk to you about.

You have, but you're not feeling
what I'm feeling.

No grabbing, Zac.

I wasn't grabbing.

[Richard] Easy with the hands.
You know the rules.

[both grunting]

[both breathing heavily]

[Christopher grunting]

[panting]

Yeah!

Yeah!

[chuckles]

[both whooping and laughing]

[metal creaking]

[creaking stops]

C'mon.

[Zac] I hate those noises.

Anything?

No.

So what's causing the sounds?

Richard says it's the cooling

and contracting of the ship
when we power down.

I don't think the temperature differential

is enough to affect
the structure that way.

Plus, Richard's a liar.

[Christopher chuckles]

So what is it?

You think it's something
on the outside, don't you?

If there's life on the planet,
why not out here?

What else can explain those sounds?

[sniffs]

[sniffs]

What is it?

Sage.

Plant that grows in warm climates.

[sniffs]

- Pine needles.
- [sniffs]

- It's beautiful.
- Hmm.

[indistinct conversation]

[indistinct conversation continues]

[Sela reading indistinctly]

You see that?

He can touch her. But I can't.

[Richard] We've lost contact with Earth

because overnight there was
a malfunction in the LCT transmitter.

I'll have to go exterior to fix it.
Zac will come with me.

And the rest of you know your roles.

[crew member 1] Right here.

- [crew member 2] Here you go.
- Thanks.

This sensor goes on your wrist
and it attaches here,

but it's tricky
because it can come loose,

so just make sure...

Make sure you pull the cuff
over the inner sleeve so that it...

[Sela gasps]

[Sela grunting]

Hey! Hey! Hey!

[grunts]

What's happening here?
Zac, what are you doing?

You're gonna lose food rations
if you don't tell me what's going on.

You okay?

[Sela] I'm fine.

Zac!

Zac.

Zac.

Phoebe, have you seen Zac?

No. But I heard what he did.

Has he done anything like that before?

I don't know,
but he stopped taking the blue.

Are you sure?

I saw him pour it out.

[Richard] Christopher.

You seen Zac?

You heard what he did?

What, you think that's okay?

No.

Good, I'm glad to hear it.

- He's not taking the blue. Are you?
- Why would I?

It's a drug. You're drugging us.

Mission made a decision
to administer medication...

to help with impulse control.

[scoffs]

To prevent exactly
this kind of thing from happening.

[inhales deeply]

It's the only way
to deal with living like this.

We didn't ask to be here.

Nobody chooses what they're born into.

But you have to find a way
to live your life.

You gotta decide
what kind of person you want to be.

You gotta try to be good.

Why?

We're just gonna die in the end,
so why can't we do what we want?

What's the difference
whether we're good or not?

- There's a big difference.
- Well, I don't see it.

Are we still doing the repair?

Yeah.

C'mon.

All right, put this on.

- Why?
- You're coming with me.

[scoffs] I don't want to go.

Look, I get that you're angry,
but I need your help with this.

And the sooner we fix it,

the sooner you can voice your objections
to mission control.

I'll back you up.

[keypad beeping]

[computer chiming]

[automated voice]
Depressurization in progress.

[air hissing]

Ninety percent.

Eighty percent.

[Richard] Kai, you ready
in the systems room?

Yes.

Control room set.

[Sela on comms]
Med Bay on 1 with vital signs.

[door opens]

[automated voice]
Depressurization complete.

Opening hatch.

Who's with him?

[Kai] Christopher.

[breathing heavily]

[Richard on comms]
We're at junction box 1.

Starting the repair.

Shut down power to LCT 1 transmitter.

Copy that. LCT 1 shutting down.

[device clicks]

[Richard]
Opening junction box 1.

[Kai on comms]
Copy that.

[Richard]
LCT 1 repair complete.

Going to LCT 2.

[Kai] Copy that.

LCT 2 shut down.

[metal creaking]

There it is.

It's just the ship.

Richard told us what it is.

[thuds]

Do you see anything?

Because there's nothing there.

- [grunts]
- [all whimpering]

[groaning]

Richard!

Richard!

[Anda] Richard! Do you read me, Richard?

[crew member 1] What happened?

- Switching to emergency power.
- [alarm blaring]

[crew member 3]
Check the breakers.

[crew member 4 on comms]
We have a fire in the systems room.

[alarm blaring continues]

[Phoebe] Navigation errors.

[crew member] I don't know.
We're trying to check.

- Negative. No effect.
- Communications.

The whole system's down.
We're not transmitting or receiving.

[Sela] No, keep the oxygen.
We're going to go again.

- [EKG beeping]
- [defibrillator buzzes]

[flatlining]

[defibrillator buzzes]

It's not working.

Are you pronouncing him dead?

It says the chief medical officer
should note the time of death.

[Sela breathes shakily]

Okay. 14:35 ship time.

[Christopher]
I just don't understand.

What actually happened?

- You didn't see it?
- I was facing the other way.

There was that sound.

Creaking.

Just before it happened.

Was anyone watching the monitor?

Yes. We didn't see anything.

I did.

[Christopher] And?

What'd you see?

It looked like...

- Like a force jumping into him.
- [all groaning]

What do you mean? Like a meteoroid?

He means something else.

Something alien.

- What?
- [female crew member gasps]

[sobbing]

It's okay.

It's going to be okay.

What's going to happen to us?

We'll be okay.

Whatever it was, it was on the outside.

We're safe inside the ship.

But without Richard...

We were going to be on our own
at some point anyway.

It just happened early.

If we keep it together,
we'll be all right.

[crew members murmuring]

- [alarm buzzes]
- [electricity pops]

[system powering up]

[automated voice]
System restarting.

[beeping]

Did you get an image?

Everything recorded is gone.

So we can't see what happened?

[Edward] The fire in the systems room
destroyed the surveillance archive.

[crew members murmuring]

The program says we need to choose
a new chief officer.

I'll be chief officer.

I'm head engineer now,
it makes sense that I be chief.

Well, what about Sela?

She's head medical officer.

I don't want to be chief.

It says everyone gets a vote.

We have an election.

[scanner trilling]

[scanner trills, chimes]

[Phoebe] And the new chief officer is...

Christopher.

[all cheering]

- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

First thing we have to do
is repair the damage.

The LCS is down, so we won't be
hearing from Earth until we fix it.

We're on our own now,
but we can work our way out of this.

[indistinct chatter]

[Christopher] We'll need the entire crew
in the damaged area

working on the repairs.

The fire knocked out
most of the systems room.

We'll look at electrical
and communications first.

Pull out all the burned equipment
and replace it.

Then we'll work
on the surveillance system.

Try to get it up and running

so we can see what
really happened to Richard.

[indistinct chatter]

Okay.

[Phoebe] Edward said the fire
destroyed all the surveillance.

[Christopher] Yeah.

The connections are burned.

But maybe the drives are still intact.

[sniffs]

[knocking at door]

Hey.

You okay?

Yeah.

What are you doing in here?

I'm supposed to destroy
his personal archive.

- Why?
- It's in the program.

They don't want us to see it.

Do I have to do it?

Yes. Of course.

[Sela] That's Richard when he was ten.

That's his sister. That's his parents.

His parents...

We only have genetic donors.

It's the same.

Is it?

We still get our natures from them.

Why did he show you all this?

He wanted someone to talk to.

What else?

What do you mean?

We saw...

We saw him touching you.

- And we thought that you and Richard...
- I didn't do anything with Richard.

We were just friends.

He showed me his things.
He would tell me about his life.

But why?

He felt... alone.

Day 1,240.

I'm not gonna be able
to keep up the count...

[both chuckle]

It's hard to explain.
On one hand, I...

I didn't feel like I had
anybody at home.

The kids seemed like
my only relationship, so...

I didn't want to lose that.

And then, on the other hand,
I believe it's a noble mission,

in the great tradition of exploration.
You know...

What's out there?
Why are we here?

Where are we going?

I won't get to see the answer,

but maybe I can move us
a little closer to it.

But I think the real reason
why I came is,

I wanted to make sure they're okay.

And I want to protect them.

Protect us from what?

[loud thud]

Everything okay?

Yes.

How's it going with the surveillance?

Not sure yet.

Where is everyone?

[indistinct chatter]

Hey, what's going on?

Why isn't everyone at their jobs?

We have to repair the damage.
We have to secure the ship.

What are you doing in here?

Bit of an emergency.

That short circuit cut the power
to the refrigerators.

We're doing everything we can
to get them back before we lose any food.

- Oh.
- Somebody should have told you.

- Can you fix it?
- Yes.

But there's a bunch of food we need to eat
before it goes bad and...

Well, I was thinking
we could have a party.

A feast.

What for?

To celebrate our new chief officer.

[chuckles]

[indistinct chatter and laughter]

[scanner trilling]

Don't drink the blue. Don't drink it.

- Why not?
- Zac says we shouldn't.

It's medication to control us.

[screaming]

[laughs]

- [man on video] Richard.
- Yeah.

[all exclaiming]

[both laughing]

[Richard talking indistinctly on video]

[Julie grunts]

[both grunting]

[crew members cheering]

[exhales]

[Julie] Kai!

[Julie giggles]

[laughs]

[shrieks]

[indistinct chatter]

- [snake hisses]
- [lion roars]

[animal squealing]

[woman moans]

- [g*nsh*t]
- [soldier screams]

[g*nf*re on TV]

What are you doing?

Get out of here now.

Everyone go!

[grunts]

Get out.

[beeping]

Just remember...

Richard isn't here to protect you.

I don't need him to protect me.

Is she all right?

She doesn't want me to touch her.

[sighs heavily]

[exhales]

[Kai grunting]

[both panting]

[knocking on door]

[Zac] Sela?

You in there?

Looking for Sela?

She's in the Med Bay.
I just saw her.

Hi.

Everything all right?

- Yeah.
- [knocking at door]

[Zac] Sela?

- [breathing heavily]
- [door opens]

[Sela] Stop.

What are you doing?

What does it look like?

Looks like you got here fast.

Get out.

Wait.

- Whoa.
- You're just like him.

No, you don't understand.
He was coming in here to get you.

- I was trying to help you.
- Why don't you help the rest of the crew?

It's getting out of control.
You're the leader.

You should do something about it.

[Zac] Why'd you do that?

What?

You knew I was going to find Sela,
and you went right to her.

You need to leave her alone.

You think 'cause you're chief officer,
you can tell me what to do?

- No.
- Good.

I'm telling you as a friend.

Stay away from her.

I'll do what I want.

[metal creaking]

[creaking continues]

[loud thudding]

[both panting]

[grunts angrily]

[grunting]

[Julie] Kai!

What are you doing, Kai?

[breathing heavily]

[Peter whimpering]

[Kai grunting]

[breathing heavily]

[indistinct chatter and laughter]

[Tayo] What's up? No, I'm good.

[chuckles]

Tayo... Tayo, get down from there.

Don't sit on the table.

[Phoebe] That's right.

You're not supposed to
put your feet where you're eating.

- Shut your face.
- [all laugh]

All right. That's enough.

- Kai.
- What?

- [grunts]
- [Kai screams]

[Christopher] No, no, no! Stop!

Stop!

[crew members clamoring]

[Peter growling]

Let go!

- Let go!
- [crew member] Let it go.

- Let it go!
- [crew member] Come on!

- [female crew member] Let go!
- Stop!

[Christopher grunts]

[groans]

Let's get them treated.

And then I want everyone
in the common room.

[all murmuring]

There's no more fighting.

It has to stop.

It's not how we resolve our conflicts.

Do you understand?

Also, some of us aren't doing our work.

No one's maintaining the ship.

Why should we if no one else does?

[Christopher]
Because if you don't, who will?

It isn't fair.

We have to repair the damage
and safeguard the ship.

I want everyone finishing
those two jobs.

The ship is secure.

We've done our job.

Then everyone should be
in the systems room.

No. Now we're working on the food supply.

This is more important.

More important than food?

No, you're wrong about that.

You haven't been working on
the food anyway.

You haven't been doing anything.

No one has.

And if we don't,
the mission won't survive.

[Kai] Who cares?

We won't make it anyway.

But somebody will.

And it's our job to support them.
To lay the groundwork.

For our grandchildren.

Who cares about them? We'll be dead.

Listen, we're going to get
that whole section up and running,

and everyone's going to work on it.

I don't want to work in the systems room.

- Why not?
- I just don't.

He thinks the alien is living in there.

What? That doesn't make any sense.

It's on the outside.

He says we brought it inside with Richard.

Christopher brought it in.

Now it's hiding in the damaged area.

That's not true.

I, for one,
don't know if there is an alien.

Who cares what you don't know?

If we repair the damage, we can watch
the surveillance video and see...

Shut your fat, pus-filled face.

I've got a right to talk.

You talk too much as it is,
you bloated, wheezing blister.

- [all chuckle]
- Zac, she can talk.

You shut up, too.

Who are you?
Telling people what to do.

I'm chief officer.

And why should that make any difference?

Because I was chosen.

It's in the program. It's in the rules.

Who cares about the rules?

Zac! Come on.

We're strong, we can do what we want.

[female crew members gasp]

Stop it! Both of you. Stop!

I'm not listening to Christopher anymore.

- He's chief officer.
- You're not a commander.

- You're not a leader.
- I'm trying to keep us on track.

Anyone who wants to follow me can.

- I'll make more food.
- That's our food, too.

And I'll protect you from the alien.
Especially if he's inside the ship now.

You're just trying to scare them.

Are you calling me a liar?

Zac, why are you doing this?

We need a new leader.

He doesn't know how to feed you.

He can't protect you.

And I'm not going to
listen to him anymore.

Anyone who wants to be
a part of my group is welcome.

We'll have more food, so we're strong.

Strong enough to fight the alien,
strong enough to k*ll it.

Anyone who wants...

can come with me.

[crew members murmuring]

[Anda] What if Zac is right
about the alien?

[Christopher] If we can just
get that surveillance drive,

then we can see what really happened.

You don't think
it's living in there, do you?

I don't know.

What are you doing?

Nothing.

Where's Christopher?

I-I don't know.

[Zac] Who's in the systems room?

No one.

You all stay here.

Don't let anyone come in.

[Kai] What do you think?

What's through there?

[thuds]

[metal rattles]

[Zac] What is that?

[metal scraping]

- Get behind it.
- [Kai] Try to close the door.

[loud crash]

- [crew members screaming]
- [Zac] Go! Go! Go!

Close it! Close it!

[Edward] What was that? What happened?

- What was it?
- [panting]

[metal rattles]

The surveillance drive.

- There was really something in there?
- What was it?

- I don't know.
- Not Christopher?

- No.
- What did it look like?

It was dark. We couldn't see.

Okay...

[beeps]

[keypad beeping]

[Richard] Start shutting down
the transmitter circuits now.

It's pretty damaged.
You can't see anything.

- [Kai on video] Copy that.
- Let's try a different angle.

[static]

I can clean this up.

It's not as bad as it looks.

[panting]

- Everything all right?
- No. [breathes shakily]

What is it?

Zac and Kai were in the systems room
right after you left.

[Alex] They said they saw the alien.

- They fought it.
- [Sela] What?

It wasn't there when I was inside.

And the room looks destroyed.

There are pieces
of the surveillance unit everywhere.

The alien did that?

Or they did it themselves.

It doesn't matter.

We have all the data right here.

But if it was Zac and Kai,
they did it for a reason.

To destroy the record.

[keypad beeping]

[computer beeps]

[Zac] Who's with him?

Christopher.

[Zac] It was supposed to be me.

[Kai] Richard looked for you.

[Richard] All right, go into LCT 2.

Copy that. Shutting down LCT 2.

You should give him a little zap
for his trouble.

[Zac] For my trouble...

A little spark.

- A sting?
- A stab.

You could do it.

- I know I could.
- [Kai] He'd be surprised.

- He'd be shocked.
- [chuckles]

[metal creaking on video]

You hear that?

Yeah, it's just the ship.

[Sela] He knew it was
the ship all along.

This one?

Yes.

[Kai] He didn't feel it.

Nothing.

[Zac] Is he touching the cable?

[Kai] Yes.
But his gloves are insulated.

[electricity crackles]

[breathing heavily]

m*rder...

[powering down]

Don't mention this to anyone.

Not until we decide what to do.

[Sela] How could Zac do that?

Why have they all gone crazy?

Maybe they haven't.

Maybe this is what they're really like.

We have our rules that keep us in line,

but deep down,
maybe this is our true nature.

No.

It can't be. I'm not like that.

You're not like that.

You're not.

And the crew will be on our side
once they know the truth.

I'm not so sure.

They don't care anymore.

Sometimes, I don't either.

You care.

I know you do.

I should leave you alone.

No.

I want you to stay.

[knocking at door]

[Zac] Time to wake up, Sela.

[knocking continues]

Go away!

[Zac chuckles]

[Zac] Oh, we're not going away.
We're coming in.

[knocking in sequence]

[door beeps]

- [Kai and Zac chuckle]
- What are you doing?

What are you doing?

I see I'm breaking up
a nice little thing here.

What do you want?

[Kai] We're having a celebration.

Right now?

Yes.

Sela's invited.

I guess you are, too.

Come eat. If you want.

Don't if you don't.

- [door beeps]
- [Sela sighs]

[indistinct chatter]

- [Phoebe gasps]
- [laughter]

- You okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

Get some food.

You must be hungry.

[chatter continues]

All right, listen up, everybody.

[chatter stops]

Now I know we've had
some disagreements in the past.

We're going to put all that behind us.

I'm chief officer now,
and that's the way it's gonna be.

From now on, we'll do the work,

but we'll do it when we want
and how we want.

We'll make the rules,

and anyone who breaks them
will have to answer to me.

The alien's somewhere in the ship.

We'll fight it again if we have to,
and we'll defeat it.

You'll be safe now
'cause I'll protect you.

- [computer beeps]
- Hey, what are you doing?

Sit down.

Richard was k*lled at 13:58:37.

- [Kai] Copy that.
- He was electrocuted.

[Kai] Shutting down LCT 1.

[Zac] Who's with him?

[Kai] Christopher.

[Zac] It was supposed to be me.

You should give him a little zap
for his trouble.

A little spark.

[Zac] A sting, a stab.

[indistinct chatter]

- [Zac] This one?
- [Kai] Yes.

He didn't feel it.

Is he touching the cable?

Yes, but his gloves are insulated.

- [electricity buzzes]
- [crew members gasp]

[crew members murmuring]

- Zac k*lled Richard.
- [crew members murmuring]

There is no alien.

Not out there, not in here.
There's only Zac.

He's been lying to you the whole time.

But now you know the truth.

You've seen it with your own eyes.

Zac should go to his compartment
while we consult the program.

Then we'll decide what to do.

It's true.

I did it.

I k*lled him.

But I did it for you.

I did it to protect you.

I did it because I saw the alien in him.

The alien was in Richard,
and then Christopher brought it inside.

- That's not true. [chuckles]
- [Zac] He shouldn't have.

He knew something was wrong,
but he did it anyway.

He brought the alien into the ship.

Just watch the rest of the video.

You'll see he's lying.

I k*lled Richard to protect the crew,

but now the alien's inside
the ship somewhere.

We need to find out
where so we can stop it.

So we can k*ll it.

That's right. We'll k*ll it.

[Zac] We'll take back control.

We've been drugged and betrayed
and programmed by liars,

but we're not going to follow
the program anymore.

We can't escape this life,
but we won't just lay down and give up.

We won't be afraid.

We won't be terrorized.

We'll fight back, we'll find it!

There's nothing to find.

Where is it now?

First, it was inside Richard.

Now maybe it's hiding in someone else.

One of you.

It could be you.

Or you.

[crew members chatting indistinctly]

Or you.

We'll k*ll it.

Yes. We'll find it and k*ll it.

- [Kai] k*ll it.
- [Julie] We have to find it.

- [crew member 1] It could be you.
- [crew member 2] Or you.

Or you.

Or him.

It's him.

- [crew members] It's him!
- [Kai] Him...

[crew members] It's him!

It's him.

[female crew member] Him.

[all] Get him!

[crew members clamoring]

[whimpering]

[grunts]

- [all grunting]
- [Peter groaning]

Stop! Stop it!

[crew members growling and grunting]

[keypad beeping]

[sobbing]

[Kai] It's okay.

He had the alien inside of him.

- I don't know.
- He did.

Don't worry.

Unless it's you who has it inside.

No.

It's not me.

[Zac] Grab anything that can
be used as a w*apon.

Scalpels, scissors, anything sharp.

We have to arm ourselves to fight.

We need something
that will make him back down.

Maybe we should just give up.

We can't give up.

But there's nothing
we can do right now.

We accused him of m*rder.
He's not going to forget that.

We should join his group.

I mean, that's all
he really wants anyway.

Maybe later we can detain him.

[Alex] That's right.

When things calm down.

Eventually, things will calm down
and be okay.

Right now, it is too dangerous.

We can't stay separate.

There's no way to fight him.
We don't have any weapons.

[whispers] Weapons.

[in normal voice]
You know where they are.

- I do?
- He said you did.

- Who did?
- Richard.

I was watching his video diary,
and he said you knew about the weapons.

[keypad beeps]

[door buzzes]

[alarm blaring]

[Julie chuckles]

[alarm blaring]

[alarm stops]

- [exhales]
- [metal rattles]

[Kai] Chief.

Wake up.

[tool whirring]

[metal scraping]

- [loud rattling]
- [crew member grunts]

Was it the alien?

It was Christopher.

[breathing heavily]

[Kai grunting]

- [door creaking]
- [Kai straining]

[straining]

[crew members murmuring]

Must be for the third generation.

When they reach the planet.

No, these are for us.

[bell tolls]

[keypad beeping]

[Kai] Chief.

They want to join us.

Why should we let you?

What else can we do?

Is the alien inside you?

There isn't an...

No, it's not.

Where're they hiding?

[Christopher] There they are.

[Phoebe] What are they holding?

Weapons.

[scoffs] And we just have this.

That's not going to help us.

Maybe it will.

We can say we want to join his group.

Like Anda and Alex.

He'll never believe it.

All we need is a moment.

[Phoebe] Why?

So we can get close.

And then what?

And then I'll k*ll him.

k*ll him?

Or he's going to k*ll us.

- No, he's not.
- They're moving.

[powering down]

They cut the power.

- What do we do?
- We stay in here.

No.

We should go out there, talk to them.

Tell them we don't want to fight.
And then...

[footsteps thudding]

[indistinct chatter]

They're here.

[all breathing heavily]

[door rattles]

Don't do anything.

- Don't resist.
- [crew members clamoring]

[Toya and Julie grunting]

[all clamoring]

Grab him.

Get off me!

[crew member] This way.

[Sela] Wait!

Wait a minute!

[panting]

Get back, Sela!

Zac.

You can't stop us.

Let me talk to you.

What for?

Privately.

You can say
whatever you want to say right here.

I want to be with you.

You want to join my group,
or you want to be with me?

Both.

I bet you do.

I do.

I'm glad you've
finally come to your senses.

I have.

I'll do anything you want.

I'm sure you will.

Only problem...

is I don't want you to.

You want to be with me,
but I don't want to be with you.

- [crew members laugh]
- [scoffs]

- Maybe someone else does.
- [laughter]

But not me.

[Phoebe] Have you all gone crazy?

Have you?

Don't you see?

All of this is against our nature.

This is not who we are.

This is who we are.

But we don't have to act this way.

We can think.
We can decide to be different.

Shut up, you genetic defect.

We can decide which is better.

- Shut up.
- Shut up.

Let me speak!

We're trying to make sense here,
and you're not listening.

[all] Shut up. Shut up.
Shut up. Shut up.

Which is better?

To have rules and agree, or...

Or to run wild and fight?

- To run wild.
- [laughter]

Do you want to listen to reason
and-and figure out a plan,

- or do you want to...
- [g*nsh*t]

- [body thuds]
- [gasps]

You see?

You see what I can do?

[w*apon charging up]

[whimpers]

[both gasp]

Which way?

You go that way. I'll check down here.

This way.

[both breathing heavily]

Check in the vats.
Check in the refrigerators.

Tayo.

Check in there.

No way they could fit.

Check all of them.

This one's been opened.

Move back, Tayo.

- What?
- Get out of the way.

[air hisses]

Zac, that's for our food.

Go see if we got them.

[Sela breathing heavily]

- [Sela] We should stay...
- [laser fires]

Check the drawers, try to find something.

[opening drawers]

[whimpers] Next to you, in the cabinet.

[door creaking]

- [groans]
- [laser fires]

[Zac] They're in the Med Bay.

[Zac] Hey!

You're okay. You're okay.

Get into a space suit.

If we go out, we'll never get back in.

[Zac yelps]

[automated voice]
Close hatch.

Close hatch.

Close hatch.

Emergency oxygen released.

[Sela and Zack yelping]

Enter closing code.

Hatch closing.

[both grunting]

Oxygen level 70%.

[Sela whimpering]

Oxygen level 50%.

- [Zac grunts]
- [screams]

- Oxygen level 30%.
- No!

[both grunting]

- [Zac grunts]
- [yelps]

[automated voice]
Pressurize now.

Pressurize now.

[Sela grunting]

Hatch stopped.

[breathing heavily]

[beeping]

[indistinct chatter]

Tayo.

Put your g*ns down.

Zac's gone.

[indistinct chatter]

How do we make sure
it doesn't happen again?

So tomorrow we go.

And as we begin our journey,

I think about the world
we are leaving behind and...

how I've seen it at its best
and its worst

and how we'll have our own bad times.

I mean, they're coming.
There is nothing I can do about it.

But I also know that you will prevail.

And our best will live on.

That we are worth saving.

[scanner trills, chimes]

[scanner trills, chimes]

[crew member]
And the new Chief is... Sela.

We are voting on everything now.

Trying to reach consensus.

It's not easy, but it's how we
want to move forward.

And we've decided
to not go back on the blue.

We feel that it's
the best course of action.

That we can do better.

[crew member] Hey, Chief,
we just started those updates.

Still been having the headaches?

[Sela] She just kicked.

[baby crying]

[baby fussing]
