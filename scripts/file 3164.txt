[eerie moaning]
[suspenseful music]

[thunder rolling]

- I've just made you a fresh
pot of coffee, Mrs. Preston.

- Hm?
- Afresh pot.

- No, thank you John, no.

- Is it slacking off any out there?

- John, it's absolutely pouring down.

I'm sorry, I'm so clumsy.

- Oh no, don't worry about it.

I'll just get you a fresh cup.

- Thank you.

- Now you relax.

- Mark, Steve?

Mark!

Well?

- No sign of him.

Or the truck.

I got as far as Simpson's Bridge,

or what's left of it, the
river's about swept it away.

- He couldn't have just
disappeared, he couldn't.

- He probably pulled off
someplace to wait the storm out.

It's still dead.

- I know.

- Winds knocked the lines down.

- I don't think so.

- What else could it be?

It's only the storm.

- Mark, don't think I'm a fool--

- Mother, don't start now.

- Please listen to me.
- Please don't st--

- It's my dream!
- I know, I know.

Your dream--
- Will you listen to me?

It's the same, night after night!

- Night after night, yes,

I know that mother.
- Yes!

- I don't want to hear any more about it.

- Mark, listen to me, it
always starts the same way.

It starts with a storm
and then your father--

- Father is alright.

It's alright.

- But--
- Mother, no.

[dog barking]

- Someone's here.

- [Mark] Dad?

Oh my god.

- Steve?

Steve?

- The book.

Corbis.

- Oh God help us.

- Where is Corbis?

- The desert.

Redstone.

He's waiting for the book.

Give Corbis what belongs to him.

[dramatic music]

[Mrs. Preston groans]

- Don't go near him, don't touch him.

[speaking in foreign language]

In the name of Satan.

That wasn't your father.

- It was his face, his clothes.

- Mark!

The book!

Don't you see?

Don't you see, my dream was a warning.

My dream was a warning.

They've found us.

[thunder rolling]

Corbis has your father.

It wasn't him, Mark, I tell you.

I tell you, it wasn't him.

He said, he said Corbis was in Redstone,

the old mining town.

- It's a godforsaken place.

- Wait a minute.

Mark, take the book to Corbis.

It's the only way.

- The book's not ours to bargain with.

- Oh please, take it.

- No, I won't give the
devil's man what he wants.

- Your father would've--
- My father

would agree with me.

- Mark, there must be
something you can do.

- Yeah.

I'll fight him on my terms, not his.

- Listen, take this with you.

Corbis can't harm you as
long as you wear this amulet.

[horn honking]

- He's here, it's the truck.

No, you stay here.

John.
- Yes?

- Take care of her.
- I will.

[thunder rolling]

[ominous music]

[loud booming]
[Mrs. Preston screaming]

[glass shattering]

[John moaning]

- [Mark] John.

Hang on, hang on tight.

It's alright.

- Get out.
- What?

Mother?

Mother!

- She's gone over the sun.

- Corbis!

g*dd*mn you!

[suspenseful music]

I'll be back.

- They had no faces.

[eerie music]

- Looks like you've been driving a ways.

Are you lost?

- No, I'm not lost.

- Use some water?

Drink up.

- It's bitter.

- Sweet way to end a
thirst though, isn't it?

Did you bring the book?

- I'll talk to no one but Corbis.

- Then speak, where is the book?

- Where you can't touch it.

I'm not afraid of you, Corbis.

- Mr. Preston, I'd be very
disappointed if you were.

We've both come a very
long way for this moment.

- And I've a ways to go yet
before I find what I'm after.

- Well if you're led by a
faith as strong as mine,

nothing can stop you.

- Depends what you put your faith in.

- Well said.

Let me show you what I've put my faith in.

- Corbis!

I'll face whatever you
have behind those doors

and come out exactly as I went in.

- A challenge?

My faith against yours.

- For my mother and father.

They go with me if I win.

- Agreed.

And if you lose?

- The book.

- And you.

[laughs]

[suspenseful music]

The ceremony will begin shortly.

Would you be seated?

[chanting in foreign language]

[discordant organ music]

[speaking in foreign language]

In the name of Satan, ruler of the Earth,

king of the world, I command
the forces of darkness

to bestow their infernal power upon--

- Lord in heaven,

hallowed be thy name.
- Come forth from the abyss,

open wide the gates of hell.
- Thy kingdom come,

thy will be done, on
Earth as it is in heaven.

- You greet me--
- Preserve my soul--

- As your brother and friend.
- From the dark angels

that you have cast into the fire.

Give us this day our daily bread.

- [Corbis] I call the gods of the pit.

I command--
- Forgive us our trespasses--

- [Corbis] Those things which I desire--

- As we forgive those
that trespass against us.

- You have bestowed upon us a vessel

for the sacred rite of the holy water.

For this, we thank thee
and summon the soul--

- Be my shield against
the terrors of hell.

- Martin Fife, [speaking
in foreign language].

Martin Fife, [speaking
in foreign language].

Martin Fife--

- In the name of God, I am Mark Preston!

- In the name of Satan, Martin
Fife come into this vessel!

- In the name of God, I am Mark Preston!

[chanting in foreign language]

Deliver me from evil.

- Evil?

There is no evil here.

Only purity.

See thy mother?

- My son, we have made
a place for you here,

and you will know the piece
of mind that I have found.

Come.

- Give me strength.

- A divine peace can be yours.

Join us.

- No.

Get away.

Let me go.

- [Corbis] Whose belief is greater now?

- [Mark] Let me go!

- Seize him!

[g*n firing]

[crowd moaning]

[ominous music]

Is that your faith?

- I'm still free, Corbis.

- Are you free, Mark Preston?

- Free my family.

- Come forth,

oh master of the world.

Present thyself to him.

Behold!

[Mark yelling]

[suspenseful music]

Soon the family name of
Preston will be no more.

- [Sam] Mrs. Preston, my associate's wife,

is consciously controlling
the rate of her heartbeat.

She's now in a state of deep meditation.

- [Woman] Dr. Richards, you
mean she's controlling her body

through willpower alone?

- Our experiments would indicate that

there's nothing in the subconscious

that cannot be raised
to the conscious level.

- [Man] Nothing, Doctor?

What about parapsychology, telepathy?

Can that be controlled too?

- Yes, I include that,
extrasensory perception.

- [Woman] Dr. Preston,
isn't there a danger

that these experiments could interfere

with normal brain activity?

- No, no, no, we've studied
many cases like this.

Found there's no reason
for concern at all.

If there were, believe me, my
wife would not be involved.

- No, no no, no dangers, only discoveries.

- [Man] Is there any proof of ESP control?

- Yes, Mrs. Preston here.

We believe that we're on the verge

of isolating the brainwave pattern

that signifies ESP activity.

- [Man] Now Julie, tell us what you feel?

- It starts with a
feeling of absolute calm,

as if I were drifting into perfect sleep,

leaving behind any cares or any fears.

It's so beautiful a
feeling, I could almost cry.

And then, way in the distance,

I see someone or someplace moving closer.

It starts with a feeling of absolute calm,

as if I were drifting
into a perfect sleep,

leaving behind any cares or fears.

Then, way in the distance,

I see someone or someplace moving closer.

Sometimes they're voices, or even music.

And then a funny change takes place.

Instead of the images moving closer to me,

I feel myself moving closer to them.

It's as if I were watching a movie

and then suddenly were acting in it.

Tom!

- Easy.

Julie, something's happened to my family.

- Oh, that really tears it.

That helicopter pilot says
he hasn't seen anybody

in that ghost town in
years, let alone yesterday.

What are we stuck with?

A pile of empty clothes

and an old man's story I'm not
even gonna take the trouble

to write up for a report.

All we need now is a flying
saucer to really put this--

- Alright, Sheriff, John's
story is just as hard

for me to believe as it is for you,

but he's sure that Mark went to Redstone.

- That place is deserted!

- Where's my family then, where are they?

- All I know is that half this county

got blown away or flooded out last night.

When John called me about your family,

my boys were bringing
in a couple of bodies.

People were stuck in a car
in that storm last night

and just tossed 'em around like a toy.

Well look at the inside of
your house, it's a shambles.

- You think a storm did that, Sheriff?

- Yes, I do.

- Then where's the family?

- Well, I don't know,

maybe they tried to run
away before the wind hit.

- And they left John here, right?

No, Sheriff, the answer's
in Redstone, you know that.

- Now look son, if I
had 100 men to help me.

It's gonna take me a long time

to clean up that mess the storm left me.

I'm gonna look for your folks,
but I can't spare one man

to go down there to that ghost town.

- I'll go myself then, Sheriff.

- I can't stop ya.

Might as well take that old road,

the old one back down through
the desert, it's clear.

I see you've got food,

but you better take plenty of water.

And you better take extra gas.

Tell you what, you give me a
call the minute you get back.

- [Tom] Yeah, I will.

- Ms. Julie, I saw them.

They had no faces.

I saw them.

- John, we're gonna
find out what happened.

Now, I want you to listen to me

and listen to me very carefully.

Dr. Richards is coming tomorrow,

and I want you to tell him
everything you've told us

and tell him that we're going

to Redstone to find my brother.

- Dr. Richards are coming here tomorrow

and you've gone to Redstone?
- We've gone to Redstone.

And tell him everything
you told us, alright?

- Alright.

Wax.

- What is it?

What is that stuff?

- It's wax.
- They just melted

and we all saw.

- We better get going.

Look, try to get some sleep, okay?

Remember, Dr. Richards?

- Yeah, I remember Dr. Richards.

Now you be careful.

- Alright, we will.

Take care John, we'll be back soon.

[John mumbling]

- Where is the book?

In the name of Satan, lord of might,

I offer you peace and salvation.

Where is the book?

You gambled and you lost.

- You bastard.

- The torment of hell
holds no terror for you.

[discordant organ music]

Behold, Lilith, queen of delights.

He truly believes he can deny us.

Show him.

- [Mark] Mother.

- Martin Fife, thy vessel is prepared.

Your journey is about to begin.

[Mark screaming]

[eerie music]

[dramatic music]

[discordant organ music]

- Weird, isn't it?

- [Julie] I've seen churches
like this in New England.

It doesn't belong here.

- Yeah, I noticed that from back there.

Here, I'm gonna go in.

[eerie music]

[speaking in foreign language]

Devil worship.

- Oh Tom, look at this.

This wax, it's the same
that was on the porch.

Oh God.

[faint moaning]

Shh, shh, what is that noise?

- Huh?

Mark.

- What is it?

- Mark's shirt.

[loud booming]

[Julie screams]

[g*n fires]

[suspenseful music]

- [Julie] Tom!
[Tom groaning]

- [Tom] Come here, alright.

- [Julie] Tom, here's some rope.

Here, tie him up.

- [Tom] What is it, Julie?

What are you seeing?

- Book.

A long time ago, I can see them.

They're, they're looking for the book.

They're looking for the book.

- [Corbis] One of thee has betrayed us.

- The book.
- How so, Jonathan?

- The book is gone, my children.

The book is gone.

But I am not.

Didst one of thee fall
from the favor of Lucifer?

Ah-hah, but thou hast taken
the pleasures of Satan

and in return, thou hast pledged

thy soul in blood in the book.

Without the book, thou art nothing.

Who?

Who amongst thee dares cast thee

into an eternity of limbo?

Who?

If the book is lost,

I, Jonathan Corbis,

Satan's minister on Earth,

cannot lead you to his
everlasting kingdom.

Now who?

Martin Fife,

it is strange thy wife Aaronessa--

- She has been ill.

- Does not join us at worship this night.

[knocking]

Be silent.

No one knows what we are about, silent.

[knocking]

Why, Preacher Blithe,

what manner of God's business keeps thee

from thy bed at this hour, sir?

- God's most holy business,
the condemning of evil!

- What say thee?

- Jonathan Corbis, thou stands accused

of foully conspiring
with Satan and his demons

to overturn the laws of God.

Thou art named a witch, Corbis!

Thou and all who follow thee.

- Thou art the one.

sl*t!
[crowd gasps]

Martin Fife, thy wife has betrayed us.

She was the one who stole the book.

- It's not my fault.

- That b*tch hauls our
names to the heathen.

- I have faith, I have faith.

- One, two, three!

- Remember--
- One, two, three!

- Thou hast sworn not to harm my husband.

- My son, the holy water,

the waxen images, thou
knowest the holy procedures.

- One, two, three!

- We shall meet again soon, my boy.

Go.

- They are upon us.

- One, two, three!

[speaking in foreign language]

[dramatic music]

- Thou art sworn not to harm him.

- I will save his soul,

and thy soul too if God allows.

As for thy bodies, they are
polluted beyond redemption,

and must suffer accordingly.

- Thou vowed, thou vowed!

- Corbis, call on thy master now.

See what it suffices
thee to bow to the devil.

Thou art guilty of the most heinous charge

of consorting with Satan and his minions.

Under the laws of this
township, thou art condemned.

God save us from the forces of darkness.

- [laughs] Think ye to destroy
something stronger than life?

By ending life? [laughs]

As the c*ck will crow in
dawn after my body burns,

so too will the sun rise and
cast my shadow over this town

again and again, you fools! [laughs]

Burn, burn!

Martin Fife, a curse on
thee and thine forevermore.

I will follow thee and thy descendants

for all eternity.

Until the book is mine again,
thou art sworn to Satan,

and I will deliver thee to his glory.

Vengeance will be mine, Aaronessa.

Vengeance will be mine! [laughs]

- He was, he was...

They were all burning, no!
- Julie, Julie!

Who was burning?

What are you talking about?

What is it?

- They're here.

[eerie moaning]

- Who, what?

What are you talking about?

- We better go.

Come on, let's get out of here.

[suspenseful music]

[tires squealing]

You can't go back there, Tom.

- [Tom] Look, Honey, I've got
to go back, you know that.

Now get to a phone and
call the sheriff, okay?

Take care.

[dramatic music]

[Julie screaming]

[chanting in foreign language]

[discordant organ music]

- No.

- Hear me, oh lord of life everlasting,

I, Jonathan Corbis, petition thee

to let me be thy voice on Earth.

Oh master of the world, hear me.

I petition thee.

[discordant organ music]

Hail, oh prince of the abyss.

In thy name,

let us behold the father.

The ram of the sun, the moon, the stars.

Hail, oh deathless one.

[loud booming]

Who calls me from out of the pit?

- [Crowd] We, thy children.

What is thy purpose?

- [Crowd] Deliver us of a soul.

- [Corbis] Has it been prepared?

- It has.

- Then I command this soul to
be purified by fire and water.

- Almighty light and
burning flame of comfort,

enter this body

and cleanse it of its unworthy soul.

[Mark screaming]

Burn.

Burn.

Burn.

In the name of Satan, lord of fire.

In the name of Lucifer, bringer of light.

In the name of Belial,
master of the earth.

Now, be sealed by the holy
waters of forgetfulness.

[speaking in foreign language]

Martin Fife, my servant,

come forth and claim the body

I have prepared for you.

[speaking in foreign language]

Open wide, the mysteries of
your creation unto this soul.

Be friendly unto him, for I am the same,

the true worshiper of the highest

and most exalted king of hell.

- Praise be

the lord of light and darkness

who is my sole

salvation.

[chanting in foreign language]

- Blasphemer, blasphemer!

- Seize him!

- You, my son, defiled all that is holy.

- Mother, my God, my God!

[crowd shouting]
[dramatic music]

[g*n firing]

[man yelling]

[eerie music]

[man grunts]
[dramatic music]

- Okay, where's Julie then?

- The sheriff called, he's
got men on the road looking.

- That's where the car disappeared, right?

Can't find it?

Yeah, well that means
that she's back there

in that damn place with Corbis.

- But they picked you up, didn't they?

- Oh Sam, come on, let's face it!

The sheriff's got God knows
how many storm victims

he's looking for, what do
you think he's gonna say

when I tell him about waxen
images and eyeless faces, huh?

How about that one?

That g*dd*mn son of a b*tch.
[glass shattering]

And what about the
disappearance of my family,

for crying out loud?

Well Sam, I don't know
what in the hell he wants

with my family, but there's
only one way to find out.

- Just slow down, slow down!

Let's try to find out
what we're facing here?

- What are we facing?
- Here, take a look at this.

- What is it, where'd you get it?

- It's a book.

I got it from John,
bequeathed to your mother,

it's been in your family for
centuries, you haven't seen it.

- Nathan Aldren.
- Yeah?

- Martin Fife, that's the name he used

last night in the ceremony.

- Right, right.

This book was owned by
Corbis, what, 300 years ago?

It's a registry of the people,

the names of the people
that he converted to Satan.

These are written in
blood, these signatures.

These are people who believe

that they've sold their
souls to the devil.

Here, this letter, read the letter.

- [Tom] I beseech thee, daughter,

and all our daughters to follow,

to protect this book and keep
it from the devil's disciple.

So long as you do, Jonathan
Corbis is powerless

to deliver his souls to Satan,

where I would rather my
beloved husband, Martin Fife,

suffer the torments of the Devil's Rain.

- [Sam] Devil's Rain, I--

- [Tom] For whilst imprisoned there,

I pray that Martin, through God's grace,

will find a way to scratch
his name from its pages.

Signed Aaronessa Fyffe, Wellington, 1680.

Now what in the hell is
he waiting 300 years for?

- I don't know, maybe the
right moment, who can--

- Or the right family.

- You'll never find the reason.

That Devil's Rain, that's new to me,

I've never heard of that.

- He mentioned that last
night in his ceremony.

- Yeah?
- He said something about,

"I condemn thy soul to the Devil's Rain."

- You know, this Corbis,

this Corbis believes that he
can separate souls from bodies.

- Oh Sam, don't be ridiculous.

- It's an old superstition,

and what you described
happened last night--

- Look, Sam, we're talking about something

neither one of us understand.

In the meantime, I don't know

what in the hell's happened to Julie!

- Wait, Tom!

- What?

Mark Preston.

- It wasn't there this morning.

- [Tom] I'm going to Redstone.

[discordant organ music]

- In the names of the
great harlot of Babylon,

and of Lilith, and of Hecate,

our lust will be fulfilled.

Adore her pleasure.

You are chosen among mortals

for immortal delight.

Who denies pleasure, denies life.

Who opens the portals of pleasure,

opens the eye of eternity.

- No.

- So we may see the divine fire.

- No, no!

[faint moaning]

- Tom, listen.

Tom!

Tom, come here.

Give me a hand.

These are symbols of Satan,

exactly as it said in the book.

- Yeah, well, that figures.

[eerie moaning]

What is that?

- Oh Tom, Tom!

- What?

- Souls.

- [Tom] Oh, God.

- Possessed by Corbis for 300 years,

from Wellington until now.

- The Devil's Rain?

Sheriff?

[dramatic music]

- Watch out Tom!

[Sheriff yelling]

[chanting in foreign language]

[ominous music]

Oi, Tom, Tom.

- What?

- Take this.

[chanting in foreign language]

[hinges creaking]

[eerie music]

[suspenseful music]

- [Corbis] Put her on the
altar of the holy flame.

I will prepare her for eternity.

- No, no!
- Julie!

Julie!

[crowd muttering]

[Tom yelling]

- You, my brethren, found the book.

You may now bring down the vessel

so we may restore it to its holy place.

- That won't be necessary.

[crowd gasping]

[eerie moaning]

- Ah, doctor, um?

- Richards.

- Dr. Samuel Richards, yes.

I've been aware of your work

through these many years, Doctor.

- Corbis, you want the Devil's Rain.

I want Tom and Julie Preston.

I do not underestimate your powers,

nor do I overestimate them.

- Thank you, Doctor.

I'm grateful that you
are aware of them, sir.

- Unless you allow Tom and Julie Preston

to leave here safely,

[crowd gasping]

I will destroy the Devil's Rain!

- [Corbis] Martin Fife,
our salvation is at hand!

Bring me forth the vessel.

- No, no, no, listen, listen to me.

You have the power now
to end your torment.

Destroy the bottle!

Without the Devil's Rain,
he has no hold on you.

You're free to choose!

- Martin Fife, you are sworn to Satan.

Come forth for your salvation.

- This is your last chance!

In all eternity, it will never come again!

Without the Devil's Rain,
he has no hold on you.

You're free to choose,
Aaronessa was right!

This is your last chance!

- The heathen lies.

- In all eternity, it will not come again.

Free the souls and free yourself!

- If you destroy the Devil's Rain,

you will wander through
eternity a creature of nothing,

neither of heaven nor of hell.

- In God's name, Martin!

Believe as Aaronessa believed!

You can be saved!

Break the bottle!

- You are sworn to Satan, Martin Fife!

- No, you're not Martin, break it!

Remember Aaronessa!

- Aaronessa.
