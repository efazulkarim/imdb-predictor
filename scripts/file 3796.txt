[wind blowing]

[man] It's Halloween.

You know what that means.

Old Sawtooth Jack is gonna

rise from the cornfields

and try to make its way

to the church

before midnight.

It's gotta be stopped.

k*ll or be k*lled.

[leaves rustling]

'Cause see,

out here,

where the wind

blows fierce

and the dust

rolls in...

you gotta give something

to get something back.

It's what has to be done.

What's always been done.

But you already

know about this.

After all,

you grew up here.

You know the story

as well as I do.

[man] We,

the Harvester's Guild,

present to you,

the Shepard family,

a fresh start.

A brand new beginning

in a new model home.

[cheering and applauding]

Thanks to

your brave service,

we can now move beyond

the darkness of this...

[sighs]

...unfortunate night.

And move optimistically

into another long

and fruitful year

of peace,

prosperity,

and prize crops.

[laughs]

[crowd cheering and applauding]

With you, Jim,

as our emissary

to the larger world,

riding high

in a brand new,

shiny...

-[keys jingle]

-Corvette.

[crowd cheering]

Well, let the midnight dance

begin!

["Teenage Heaven" playing]

I want a house with a pool

Shorter hours in school

And a room

With my own private phone

I wanna stay up

All night...

[Jim] I'll write soon.

Take me with you.

No more troubles...

Come here.

...Or worries at home

I love you, Baby B.

Mmm, just gimme

Some time on my hands

[crowd cheering]

I wanna make

My own private plans

[crowd cheering]

...My own Coupe de Ville

Make my dad pay the bill

Yeah, man

That's heaven to me

There ain't no stop signs

on the black road!

-[Jim laughs]

-[car engine revs]

["Watusi Zombie" playing

[radio channels glitching]

["Weird" playing]

-[firecrackers exploding]

-[woman screams]

[boy chuckling]

Oh, f*ck, dude!

Damn these kids!

[Ricks] The reaper

that grows in the field.

The trick

with a heart

made of treats.

[school bell rings]

[students chattering]

The butchering nightmare

with the saw teeth...

And he's gonna get you.

That's what they always

told you.

He's gonna get you...

So, you know

you've been got.

[all laughing]

[Ricks] Laugh it up.

No, get it all out

now 'cause,

this is not

a f*cking game!

One of your classmates

will certainly die.

That thing grows

all year long in our fields,

only to rise up

every Halloween night

with a single,

solitary purpose.

To destroy

our way of life.

Hey, we're gonna

win this thing.

Get the slide.

[projector clicks]

You've all heard

the stories

about that one time

we failed at our duties.

And that black duster

rolled in and destroyed

our crops, our lives.

It must die,

so we can live.

Your sacred duty,

is to take down

Sawtooth Jack

before that church bell

rings at midnight.

And to get you

fat little nancies ready,

we make you

hungry for it.

Three days.

No food, no mommy,

no nothing.

Locked up alone

in your bedrooms

to sit and think long and hard

about what you have to do.

And on

the night of the Run,

when one of you

fulfills your duty,

you all will fill

your bellies full.

Now the fun stuff.

Thank you, Officer Ricks.

So...

Who wants

to be the coolest kid

with the hottest car

in town?

Chevrolet Corvette, 1964.

-Next year's model.

- [students exclaim]

[man] Winner

of this year's Run

gets the keys

to this beautiful tank of gas,

and some traveling

around money.

A gift from

the Harvester's Guild.

Jim Shepard,

last year's winner,

he, uh...

he's out in California.

Seeing the world. Now...

[boy 1] The f*ck

is he doing here?

Oh.

His big brother won,

and now he thinks

he's Mr. Westside.

Gets a chickenshit waiver.

-I'm doing it.

-[chuckles mockingly]

Who f*cking volunteers

to do the Run?

Huh? We all...

We don't have a choice.

[boy 2] Some of us do.

They can force us

to do the Run,

but no one can force me

to k*ll anything.

Shut up, pinko.

[boy 3] This whole thing

is horseshit.

It's rigged.

Sawtooth, too.

You really think

that's friggin' real?

Officer Friendly there?

He buses in

a boogie inmate

from the Dixie Springs

Correctional.

I heard this, too.

He stuffs his britches

full of candy,

puts on a big fat pumpkin,

on his woolly head...

and boo.

[boys chuckle]

[boy 4] I saw it.

It's real.

When was this?

When I was nine.

[sighs] My mom, she, uh,

told me not to look outside,

no matter what I heard.

But... [sighs]

I looked outside

my window anyway.

He was there.

Who?

[wheezing]

-Sawtooth Jack.

-[growls]

I saw it.

On my neighbor's porch,

in the old Partridge place,

before they moved

to the Westside...

[boy 1] Shut the f*ck up.

b*aner.

[all laughing]

What do you know about

doin' the Run?

Mexicans ain't even

allowed to win.

-f*ck you.

-Bullshit, says who?

Whoa, Westside Boy

getting mad now.

Get bent.

-[groans]

-[Ricks] Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

[all clamoring]

You don't belong here.

Come on.

Out!

[rock music playing]

[panting]

[Kelly] The movie

already started.

[Richie] No, I know.

I, uh...

You hiding?

What?

No.

I, uh, wanted a snack.

Most kids go to Waltons.

Waltons doesn't

have jujubes.

We don't have jujubes.

Right.

[hesitates] You know...

Can I just have a small

buttered popcorn?

Riley Blaike

is a real as*h*le.

Who?

On the house.

Really?

Why not?

Betcha.

You're Jim Shepard's brother.

You're the new girl.

I know a lot

about your brother, but...

I don't know anything

about you.

I'm hard to pin down.

[chuckles]

Sure. [chuckles]

Could I get me a pop, too?

You know what?

I've never met someone

from somewhere else before.

Where you from?

[sighs]

Another small town.

[Richie scoffs]

You're not going

on a trip, are you?

One day.

Are you going

to the midnight dance?

I'm not invited.

Why not?

Well, after I win the Run,

I'll make sure

you get invited.

You can duck into the movie,

if you want. It just started.

Nah. I should really...

Dig you later.

[Kelly sighs]

[Kelly]

Be careful out there.

-That girl is trouble.

-Who?

The betty

you're makin' eyes at.

She's fuckin' bad news.

Burned down

Old Man Bagley's barn.

The one we used

to throw rocks at?

-Where'd you hear that?

-Pat Shanley.

Says she lit up that old

mine shaft, too,

over on Route 12.

Hey, you better

watch yourself, man.

She's got an axe to grind.

This way.

[doorbell tinkling]

Oh.

Hear your brother's

up in Santa Clara.

What's he doin' up there?

Seeing the world, I guess.

[storeowner] Well,

they got a great

varsity team.

When are you gonna

play ball, aye?

Not my thing.

[storeowner] Well,

if you have half

the arm your brother has,

we'd be in good shape. Hey.

You oughta think about it.

You know,

maybe he

is up in Santa

whatever, I dunno,

who f*cking cares?

[bell tolling]

I don't wanna go home.

-Let's breeze outta here.

-Hey, so...

What?

It's curfew.

Don't be such

a pantywaist, Bud.

Come on,

come smoke with us.

But it's curfew.

[scoffs] What?

See you guys tomorrow?

[Richie] So that's

your big idea?

Come on, man.

You should do it.

You know I'm not allowed.

f*ck it. Just 'cause

your brother won

the Run last year?

Look, Jim's

a great guy and all...

-but you're faster.

-I know that.

-Tougher.

-You know...

Try telling that to my folks,

all right?

They worship the ground

my brother walks on.

It's embarrassing. [spits]

If I was to make a bet...

Scout's honor?

I'd pick you

over your brother

to win the Run any day.

You really mean that?

Really?

sh*t, I say we

do it together, man,

You and me, let's do it.

You know, and then

I can move into

your neighborhood again.

We can live next door

to each other,

just like before.

Like nothing's changed,

you know?

[bell tolling in distance]

We better get going.

[chains rattling]

[sign board creaking]

[wind blowing]

[Donna singing along to radio]

Gonna build me a daydream

With a little hope

Gonna push that daydream

Up the mountain slope

Dear Lord, bless this food

and grant that we may

thankful for thy mercies be.

Amen.

-Amen.

-[Donna sighs]

Oh.

This came for you today.

[Richie] This is it?

No letter, no nothing?

I saw Annie last night.

At... At Bible study.

Poor gal. She still holds

a flame for Jimmy.

And who can

blame her, really?

It's not her fault.

She doesn't have the same kind

of opportunities that we do.

You're very lucky.

So I've heard.

-Watch your tone, boy.

-[boy] What?

She talks like we weren't

living on the East Side

just a year ago.

When he comes home

for Christmas,

Jimmy will have

to set Annie straight.

I'd hate to see that girl

get her heart broken,

but...

Been doing a lot

of thinking lately.

Thinking about what?

Doing the Run, maybe.

Why would you say that?

Jim got to do it.

Why can't I?

Because your brother won.

So?

Richie, listen to me.

Everything you see,

all this,

the house, the car...

We already have it.

You can't win it again, son.

It's not... It's not fair

to the other boys,

-and the other families.

-Donna. Donna.

What you want,

it doesn't matter.

And you know this.

You know this.

So I need to

hear you tell me

why it does not matter

what you want?

Tell me right now

because why?

-[loudly] Because why?

-Because it's against the--

Because it's against

the rules, that's right.

f*ck the rules.

-[slaps]

-[Donna gasps]

[Dan exhales] I...

I'm the bad kid?

-Sorry.

-Is that it?

I'm the bad kid,

and Jim's the good kid?

I'm just supposed to be

thankful and lucky

for the rest of my life?

For what?

This big house

and your shitty Cadillac?

I'm good at things, too,

you know.

Please sit down.

I'm smart.

You're my baby boy.

[breathing heavily]

Richie, please.

I'm doing the Run.

You can't stop me.

[Dan] Richie.

["Since I Don't Have You"

Happy hours

[Annie] Hi, Richie.

You're homesick

for the East Side?

[Richie] Annie.

I never will again

[Annie]

Got a postcard today.

When you walked out on me

In walked old misery

And he's been here

Since then

I've always wanted

to go to New Orleans.

I...

[Richie groans]

You think you're special,

[Riley grunts]

[Riley exclaims]

How are you

Jim Shepard's brother?

[spits]

-[both laugh]

-[Riley] Whoo!

[slow pensive music playing]

[Jim] " I looked

up one day and...

saw it was one year later

and I thought,

'Hey, Baby B

must be 18 by now.'

Happy belated.

So, you're probably

sore at me

for not writing

a proper letter sooner,

and I'm sorry about that.

I can't have you come out

right now, not just yet.

All this traveling

and seeing the country

can get pretty lonely.

I think about coming

back home sometimes.

Maybe get hitched

to good old Annie,

if she'd take me back.

Get a job at the mill.

Settle down for good.

Ah, but heck,

I can't come home now

with everyone thinking

I'm some hero or something.

I know every dumbass kid

wants to be tough

and prove himself, but...

if I were you,

I'd just stay put."

[breathes heavily]

"Winning the Run

ain't everything."

"I'll be home soon,

I promise you that,

okay?

Just be good for now

They need you."

You're not hearing me, son.

You're gonna listen to me.

And honey.

[Mitch] What the hell

are you talking about?

I was wide awake.

I could hear

the older boys outside,

hunting for it like dogs.

[Richie] You okay, Bud?

I saw it.

Saw Sawtooth rise up,

floating over some kid,

some older kid,

and I was waving at him,

yelling.

Trying to warn him, but...

[Richie] What's the matter

with you?

It was too late.

He turned around and...

Skid marks start here.

[Mitch] Hey, don't!

[Mitch] k*ll first.

Eat later.

Remember?

[Charlie]

I'm so f*cking hungry.

You must've hit him, Mitch.

Busted him open

-Is that it?

-No.

I don't give a sh*t

Then why are you

Girls aren't even allowed

-[boy] Twenty bucks.

I don't have 20 bucks.

That's what everyone

I'll pay you back tomorrow,

first thing, promise.

-Just... Just...

-Cash up front, man.

-That's the deal.

-Please.

Look, it wouldn't be fair

[Richie] Officer...

d*ck's.

[banging on door]

You wanna go for a ride?

[car engine starts]

Get your pansy a*s out here!

You thought

I wouldn't find out, huh?

I got eyes and ears

everywhere, Chief.

I know every single

g*dd*mn thing

-that's going on this here--

-[car door closes]

Do not!

[engine revving]

[g*nshots]

f*ck!

[Richie laughs]

[car horn honking]

Where did you learn

how to do that?

I know things.

Okay.

So...

What's the plan?

That was my plan.

Get a g*n.

[woman over radio]

Jer, you there? Over.

Jerry, the burglar alarm

at Jarrett's

is ringing like crazy.

There's some big commotion

going on over there

on Main Street.

Someone said

they spotted Sawtooth.

[indistinct shouting]

[glass shattering]

[alarm ringing]

What the f*ck? Get back!

Get... Hey.

Get back. Get back.

[boy 1] Give us

a f*cking sandwich.

[shotgun fires]

[boys howling]

Get back!

-[shotgun fires]

-[groans]

[growls] Is that all

ya got, savages?

-[boys barking]

-Back!

[boy yells]

[whack]

[groans]

[body thuds]

[groans]

Oh. Oh.

Oh, f*ck off.

[squelching]

[boy] My dad's

gonna k*ll me.

Jesus Christ.

[Kelly] We better move.

-[Riley] A girl?

-[gasps]

The f*ck is all this?

[struggling]

Hey...

What are you doing,

Shepard?

Let her go.

Wait...

[chuckles] Wait

a pick-a-ninny minute here.

Are you making it

with a n*gro?

[struggling]

Let her go...

now.

Uh...

Why don't you fight

me for her?

[Kelly grunting]

[boy screams]

Ugh! You little b*tch!

-[groans]

-[Richie grunts]

-[Richie grunting]

-[nose cracks]

My nose. My nose.

[Kelly winces]

You got a g*n?

I got a g*n.

That's not fair.

That's a g*n.

And she's a girl.

And I'm a n*gro.

With a club.

[grunting]

That fair enough for you?

I'll be taking this.

[Richie] Let's go.

[boys] Whoo!

You're looking at

this year's winner

of the Run.

Any of youse doubt it?

[boy] Yeah! Yeah!

What about you, copper?

Think you got what it takes?

Come and get it.

-[squelch]

-[all exclaiming]

[boys laughing]

[howling]

[boys laughing]

Front for a rock band

in Jersey?

Where'd you hear that?

It's what

everyone's saying.

No. No one is saying that.

I heard he got an album

coming out.

[chuckling]

Teenagers From Mars.

Jim Shepard

is not in a rock band,

okay?

He couldn't carry a tune

even if he...

[Sawtooth Jack wheezing]

[thuds]

[growling]

[Richie] "HG."

What is that, like,

"The Harvester's Guild,"

maybe?

[Kelly] They own

the movie theater.

[Richie]

They own everything.

If you wanna leave town,

even for a vacation,

I heard you have to ask

for the Guild's permission.

[Kelly scoffs]

That can't be true.

You're not like

other girls around here,

that's for sure.

Let's try this.

What do you know about me?

What have you heard?

[Richie clicks tongue]

People say you're...

[scoffs] Uh...

What?

I don't know.

Pat Shanley says

you burned down

Old Man Bagley's barn.

Why would I do that?

I don't know.

That's stupid.

Forget it.

It doesn't matter.

What else have you heard?

Pat Shanley also said

you burned down

the old mine shaft, too.

Who is this Pat Shanley?

He's got a big mouth.

I mean, is that what

people are saying,

that I'm some

kind of pyromaniac?

It doesn't matter.

They're lying.

Okay.

Hey, look,

I didn't believe him, okay?

And it doesn't matter,

either.

I mean, who cares, right?

This town?

People talk.

They like to run their mouths

about things they know

nothing about.

I know.

Like my brother?

Everybody's got

their own opinion

about where he's at,

what he's doing.

Like he's some sort of...

hero.

But Jim,

he was just my brother,

you know?

He's just a normal kid

like me. Nothing special.

I mean, he played baseball

real good. Sure.

But even after some big game,

he still found time

to hang out with me.

Work on cars.

We really liked

to work on cars.

We were more like

best friends.

Where is he now?

I don't know.

He doesn't want

to be found, I guess.

I get that.

[sighs heavily]

My parents are dead.

Car accident.

Last summer.

My dad, he lived here

long before I was born.

He never talked

about this place,

except how he never

wanted to come back.

So...

After the w*r,

he settled

somewhere else.

Met my mom,

had me.

That's why

I was sent here.

I live with

my auntie now and...

[sighs] She don't like me

all that much, you know?

She thinks I'm wild.

Wild?

I burned down

Old Man Bagley's barn.

Oh.

He called me

a nasty name.

He had it coming.

What about

the old mine shaft?

That was just for fun.

-Bitchin'.

-[both laugh]

[woman over radio]

Jer, are you there? Over.

Jerry, I just got a call.

Sawtooth was spotted alone,

hiding over on Oak Street

in front of the Guild's

Country Club.

It's getting

close to midnight,

so you might want to tip off

some of the boys

to his location. Over.

Good work, Edith.

I owe you one.

[chuckles] You betcha.

[owl hooting]

[wind howling]

[suspenseful music playing]

Jesus.

[wind howling]

[Sawtooth Jack growling]

-[snarls]

-[g*n cocks]

[inaudible dialog]

[growling]

-[screams]

-[Sawtooth Jack screeches]

[smack]

[Kelly groans]

[man] The hell's

going on out here?

[groans]

You get your a*s

back out there. Now!

[Kelly groaning]

[exhales] What the hell

happened to you back there?

Stupid.

I'm so f*cking stupid.

Why didn't you...

All these boys...

-[g*n cocking]

-[Ricks] Don't f*cking move.

Out of the car now.

[Richie] You know

somethin', Ricks?

I don't think I care much

for this Podunk town anymore.

[Ricks yells] Out!

[softly] Of the car.

[sighs] This guy's

stuck in one gear.

You.

[laughs]

Kelly Haines.

I know you.

I knew your mommy

and your daddy, too.

Ooh, he had a lip on him,

your dad.

He tried to get away

by jumping the line, but...

I caught up with him. Hmm?

They thought they

could get away, too.

See how that turned out.

[both grunting]

-[g*n fires]

-[ears ringing]

-[Ricks yells]

-[Kelly groans]

[both grunting]

-Go, go!

-[Ricks screaming in pain]

You mother...

f*ck!

[Donna]

S tarlight lies

Richie, you came home.

Who's your friend?

Get some ice and towels.

[Kelly groans]

Do it!

Here.

[Donna singing softly]

Starlight lies

With sweet dream eyes

Gonna build me a daydream

[Donna sniffles]

[Richie] Who won the Run

the year before Jimmy?

Curtis Johnson, of course.

Where is he now?

Somewhere East.

East of Eden,

was the name of the book

he wrote, I think.

He's a famous writer now.

That can't be right.

[chuckles softly]

And the year before that?

Bobby Rokos.

What happened to him?

-[growling]

-[Donna] He died

in a terrible car accident.

You know that.

[Richie] And the year

before that?

[Donna] Doug Steckles.

You remember.

[Richie] What happened

to Doug Steckles?

[Donna] Richie,

I don't understand.

Why all the questions?

[Jim] There ain't

no stop signs

on the black road!

[boys chanting]

Jim's the winner!

Jim's the winner!

Jim's the winner!

Jim's the winner!

[growling]

[chanting continues]

I need you

to be honest with me.

Okay.

Don't lie.

Lie?

Did you write the letter?

What letters?

The letter from the other day,

did you write that?

The postcards?

Did you pretend you were Jim

to get me to stay home?

Mom, please.

[chuckles]

No. I...

Honey, why would I do that?

Please. Come on. Tell me.

-[laughs]

-Mom.

[Donna] Are you sure you

don't want another cupcake?

Mom.

Let me get you some milk.

Mom.

[sighs]

[Donna singing]

Starlight lies

With sweet dream eyes...

Mom!

Tell me the truth.

Please.

It has to end.

Mom?

Put an end to it, Richie.

-[stabs knife]

-[tense music playing]

Mom? What the f*ck!

[screeching]

[Ricks] What now?

[Dan] I'm not doing it.

I've had enough.

There's only so much

a man can take before...

Yeah, you're gonna do

what needs to be done.

And that's that.

[Dan sighs]

[Ricks scoffs]

This f*cking night.

You and your wife,

you like living in that

big house you're living in?

Hmm?

It's...

not worth it.

Casey.

You remember

my brother Casey?

When Casey went missing,

my old man,

he marched straight out

into that dust storm

to go look for him.

For hours, me and my sister

were alone in that house,

the wind rattling at

the walls, the windows...

And when that black duster

finally passed, days later...

I found my big brother.

He was a hundred yards

from the front door, just...

lying there,

bloated...

An arm reaching out

for our house.

And when my old man

fell to his knees

and lifted his eldest

into his arms...

Casey's body,

it split open

and sand poured

out of his belly.

That freak

made it to the church

before midnight

one g*dd*mn time...

and for nine

long fuckin' years

this town went

a little mad,

and all because of some

panty waisted daddy

who didn't have the stones

to do what needed to be done.

[Dan groans]

-Are you that guy, Dan?

-[groaning]

-Huh?

-[crying]

If that thing isn't dead

by midnight,

this whole g*dd*mn town

is going straight to Hell,

and your wife and that

piece of sh*t son of yours

-are gonna find themselves...

-[groans loudly]

...buried in a cornfield

somewhere.

[Dan breathing heavily]

[crying]

-He's your responsibility.

-[sighs]

Huh?

Get it done.

[taps car]

[Kelly sighs]

[Kelly] We could sneak out.

While everyone is preoccupied

with the Run,

we could leave.

Get out. Just...

Run away.

Let's run away, Richie.

No.

Why not? Let's just go.

Get out of this

f*cking place now.

If he gets to the church

in time, then...

There will be no winner...

To sacrifice.

[Kelly sighs]

I'm ending this.

Tonight.

I'm coming with you.

[Edith over radio]

Jer, we got a call on a fire

over on Maple Avenue.

The old Shepard house,

I think. Over.

I'm on my way.

Over and out.

[boys growling and shouting]

[brakes screeching]

[boys whooping]

-Whoa, hey.

-[Ricks] Relax.

The hell do you want?

-[breathing heavily] Sawtooth.

-Huh?

I just saw him. He's...

He's a couple blocks over,

-in front of the Healy place.

-[distant expl*si*n]

[chaotic shouting]

Everything's gone

nuts tonight.

-Get in the car.

-What?

Get in the car!

Where are we going?

Congratulations, kid.

You're this year's

big winner.

[boy 1] What the...

[boy 2] Come on.

Let's go look.

[Richie] Where'd everyone go?

Do you see anything?

[Kelly] No.

Let's check inside.

[door opens]

[door closes]

Dad?

What are you doing here?

[Dan] Just doing

what has to be done.

I know the truth.

Not all of it.

I'm going to save him.

Richie, I need you

to listen to--

I'm going to end

all of it.

Listen!

There's no winning

this thing, son.

If that...

thing...

walks through the church door

before midnight, I--

Say his name.

I came here to stop...

Say his name!

I...

[ominous music playing]

[growls]

[Richie] Say his name!

Say. His. Name.

Jim.

Jim.

Your brother.

My son.

I came here to...

To stop my own son.

He has to lose. Again...

Knowing what you knew...

Richie, I swear to you,

I didn't know

anything at first.

When Jim won the Run,

your mother and I...

We were thrilled.

Then we were brought

into the Guild

and we were

told the truth.

And we were

sworn to secrecy

and that was that.

That was that.

I never had a say

in any of this, Richie.

None of us did.

-Not me. Not your mother--

-Why didn't we just leave?

Because they

would have k*lled us!

If you're born in this town,

you're cursed.

They would have

m*rder*d us.

-No one can ever leave, son.

-Who?

-They'll...

-Who?

[Kelly] Ricks.

The Harvester's Guild.

[Dan] Richie, look at me.

Look at me, son.

Tonight, some other boy

will win the Run

and we will move on.

You understand me?

We will move on.

And our family will no longer

have to suffer--

But somebody has to die.

Yes.

But not you.

Someone who's

not in my family.

Mom's dead.

Tell me.

What could be worse

than losing your own son?

-Your wife?

-[crying]

All for what?

A big house?

Is that it?

Is that all

you care about?

You all were willing to

sacrifice your own sons

for a f*cking Cadillac?

[Dan crying]

You disgust me.

[bell tolling]

Richie, Richie.

No. Richie.

Richie. Richie!

Wait!

[suspenseful music playing]

[GROWLS]

It's okay.

Jim, it's okay.

-It's okay, Jim.

-[growls]

Come on.

It's me.

It's okay.

It's okay.

It's okay.

Come on.

Come on.

-[g*n fires]

-[screeches]

No!

[wheezing]

-[Kelly grunting]

-[groans]

g*dd*mn it.

[Richie]

Come on. Come on.

[Ricks] Get up.

-Get it done.

-[grunts]

[Richie] Come on.

Come on. Come on!

-Come on. Come on. Come on.

-[wheezing]

Let's go. Come on.

Come on.

-[g*nsh*t]

-[shrieks loudly]

No. No, no, no, no.

[wheezing]

Me. Who? Me.

I've never thought

I'd win the Run.

[Sawtooth Jack wheezing]

No, I can't.

I'll do it!

You don't f*cking

touch him.

-[trembling]

-[Sawtooth Jack wheezing]

[bell tolling]

No. No, no, no.

[sobbing]

I'm sorry.

[g*nsh*t echoes]

[imperceptible cheering]

[all cheering]

Well, I'll be...

Congratulations, kid.

[boy 1] Richie. Richie!

-[boy 2] Damn, Richie!

-I'll be taking that.

[boys chanting]

Richie's the winner!

Richie's the winner!

Richie's the winner!

Richie's the winner!

Richie's the winner!

Richie's the winner!

Richie's the winner!

Richie's the winner!

Richie's the winner!

Richie's the winner!

Richie's the winner!

Richie's the winner!

[chanting continues faintly]

["Since I Don't Have You"

playing]

[chorus vocalizing]

[Ricks sniffles]

[Ricks] Ugh.

I don't...

[Ricks]

I gotta hand it to you.

I didn't think you

had it in you.

[laughs]

And I don't have

Hopes and dreams

You're gonna be remembered

for a long, long time, Richie.

Future generations

of young boys with big dreams

will look up to you.

You're a hero.

I don't have happiness

And I guess

I never will again

When you walked out on me

In walked old misery

And he's been here

Since then

I don't have plans

And schemes

And I don't have

Hopes and dreams

I don't have anything

Since I don't have you

I don't have love to share

And I...

[whispers] Pack your

things and wait for me

at the crossing.

You wanna run away with me?

I don't have anything...

Say it.

I want to run away with you.

Where would we go? You and me?

Anywhere.

You just pick a place

in that little book

of yours and we'll go.

Anywhere you want.

They're gonna

come after us.

I know.

We probably won't

make it out.

Maybe not.

I won't stay here

any longer.

No.

Hold me.

I don't have love to share

And I don't have

One who cares

I don't have anything

Since

I don't have

You

[cheering and applauding]

[camera shutter clicking]

[man] Thanks

to your brave service,

we can now move

beyond the darkness

of this unfortunate night.

And move optimistically

into another long

and fruitful year

of peace,

prosperity,

and prize crops.

[cheering and applauding]

[camera shutter clicking]

With you, Richie,

as our emissary

to the larger world,

riding high,

in a brand-new, shiny,

Corvette.

[crowd gasping and exclaiming]

Take it for a spin.

[cheering and applauding]

Take me with you.

Please.

I'll do anything you want.

Richie, please.

There ain't no stop signs

on the black road.

-[car engine starts]

-[all cheering]

[indistinct chatter]

Just doing

what has to be done.

What's always been done.

I've been hearing

that line of bullshit

from you all year long.

You got a backbone

all of a sudden?

I let one son down.

I'm not about to let

another one down.

Oh, boo-f*cking-hoo, Dan.

Stand back.

All you had to do

was keep your kid

locked up for one

friggin' night.

[laughs] One night!

But you couldn't even

manage that,

could you now?

I said stand back!

No, your piece of sh*t son

had to go and prove himself

and win the g*dd*mn Run.

And now I have to put

the little fucker

-into the ground.

-[yells]

[g*n fires]

Hey, you weren't followed?

-Not yet.

-[laughs]

-[engine revving]

-[Kelly screams]

[Richie] Whoo!

-Oh, Rich.

-[both laugh]

[Richie sighs]

We're gonna make it.

-[siren blaring]

-Get down.

-Get down. Get down.

-Okay.

[siren continues blaring]

[suspenseful music playing]

-sh*t!

-[tires screeching]

What are we gonna do?

[Ricks] Hands up where

I can see 'em!

If I'm not back

in 10 minutes...

leave without me.

Richie, no.

Hands up.

Where I can see 'em!

[grunts]

Let me see 'em!

Whoo.

Walk towards me now.

Walk!

Slowly!

Slowly.

Slowly.

[laughs gleefully]

Huh?

Your old man

tried to save you.

Get your a*s over there.

I said get it!

Go on. Move.

You know, you and me,

we never really did

get along, did we?

Hmm.

And yet,

in spite of it all...

I do respect you, Richie.

[clicks tongue]

I ain't a hard guy.

And that's why this is going

to be especially hard--

-[g*n fires]

-[groans]

You piece of sh*t.

It's over.

[laughing]

[groaning]

You k*lled my brother

and all those boys.

And for what?

[groaning] I was just doing

-what had to be done.

-For who?

That's what's

always been done!

For who?

How does it even

f*cking matter anymore?

Huh? Huh?

Get out of here, now.

-Go on.

Please.

Before someone sees you.

Richie.
