The holy ceremony.
The body is first freed from all evil, so that it can be trodden down, and the energy is strong.
And you believe in it?
It doesn't matter what I believe?
They believe in it.
And if they believe in this, then ...
They must also believe in it.
Did you know your boys?
Yes.
I'm a childlike child.
- Can I do something, Father?
- Yes.
Did you hear Mrs Gy szol tk r l?
I didn't hear this name from my childhood.
The Lady.
It was an excellent match.

Then one day, a wealthy farmer came to the village. I liked it very much. They were happy to go together. Some children were born who were very loved. AZTN ...
after a while ... she grabbed the hair with a younger woman.
- What did you do?
"He took away the best he loved."
She had her children.
They pushed them down into the water in a hot air.
When he realized what he was doing, he became harsh.
And he threw himself into the river. That's where F ld n walks, and he is looking for children for his sons.
Tell the little ones to be good.
Accept the elderly.
Then, the Giving Lady, and they kidnap them.
Wow, is this a fairy tale?
Somebody's.

Do you remember what dad always said?
When he wasn't with you, he was ...

So what about Mici?
That's a little better, isn't it?

- Anna, you know you can't be here.
- Come on, Donna.
- You got the heads.
- They say right.
- I never mind my children.
- You're right.
You can't be here.
As much as it is incredible, I don't read this situation.
I was safe for the apes to take care of you. If I can help you, please cool down. All right?
They release Patricia Alvarez freely. We have no previous evidence.
Maybe not the culprit.
That's what you rted?
- I do not know. All the same.

B rmi is going on here too, please.
Dad, I'm ahead of me, I'm in love.

I know it sounds incredible.
P r ve m g did not believe in such a thing. In legends, in fairy tales ...
The night is in sight.
Hey ... t rt nt something.
With a baby.
Now, I accept that you have what you have no explanation for.
Help us?
In such cases, the church will always help you.
- I have.
- But ...
We can only contact you from R m n.
- How long does it take?
- In the best case, leave a cooler for a while.
There is another possibility. Unofficial, but I know someone.
But if he chooses this path, I have to follow the rules of the church. That is, I cannot deal with the case.
As I said, this guy has some tools. The Church, Well ...
he has his own methods, and he has the same. That's exactly what happened.
- Were you a priest?
- Yes ...
. And now you can see it. S m nk nt confuses the religion with the knowledge so to speak.
That is, kurzsl .
Don't touch anything, okay?
- It's a day, she's gone.
- I saw it.
The Alvarez is funeral ... right?
- Yes, I was their guardian.
"Hey, if you just have to be so crazy, not shit." I'm busy.
Megrtem. I think we're in the wrong place. Hey, let's go.
Have you seen such a ring?
- Yes.
- But what is it?
- Tell a priest.
- No, no, no, worse. A priest told us here.
But ... this is the one thing.

This is Mrs Gyszol 's work.
Wow, you can see it.

There is never.
Only what he was doing.
- So what happens now?
- It's a very rough, evil force.
But not l man.
- Right?
- No.
He was.
As soon as the murderer szt n raised it.
Unscrupulous things have been missed.
Unholy, God refused.
- I don't mind. I'll take them to a motel.
- What?
She must have her children. Not the heat. No matter where they go. They're hitting themselves.
So what do we do now?
- I don't think this is the solution.
- No.
Not only that.
The funeral ...
- I saw you interact with Perez.
- You said you were a priest.
My journey started in the monastery.
Yes...
But it was very rude.
Let's go to the cool, and let's see it.
- We are.
- Excuse me, but I just do everything with you?
What does it look like?
Elgg.
Come with me.
This ceremony is called "La limpia". Bring the evil. If it is present.
The more the blood, the greater the evil.
