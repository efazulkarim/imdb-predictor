Yeah, Hindi, and a little bit
of Urdu.

Let's get what it wants.

What?

It obviously
wants something.

Maybe if we give it
what it wants, it'll stop.

["Hamara India" playing]

[Music stops]

Wait, where'd it go?

It... it's Hindi.

Keerat.

Keerat?
What's Keerat?

It's a girl's name.

"Me."

Who's Keerat?

How should I know?

Look up
your employee records.

[Scoffs] Employees...
We don't have employees.

Over there, it's just
lines and lines and lines

and lines of subcontractors.

We don't actually know
who... who works for us.

Well... then,
how can you know if you're

employing fair trade workers
and that they aren't working

in sweatshops and that the
cotton they're using is organic?

We don't!

Okay? Jesus!
That's just a line.

When are you gonna
figure that out?

No, no, no, no, no.

No, no. W-what we can do
and what we do know

is we can trace everything
back about those chains.

We know exactly which
genetically modified seed

- they're grown from.
- GMOs?

You're using GMOs?

How do you think they
can make a pair of jeans

for five dollars
and sell them for ?

"Dead."

How old were you
when you died, Keerat?

It's not called child labor
for nothing, right?

Hold on now. The SCC has
strict ethical standards...

You just said you can't
trace back who works for you!

You guys were supposed
to be the good guys.

I came here to do good.

And get
half-price clothes.

We have to help her.

"Justice."

"Justice for Keerat."

Keerat, if we tell
the world your story,

will you stop k*lling?

No, stop!

What did you do?!

You idiot!

I had her.

And you just
made her mad again.

Oh, I'm so sorry.

Did I not get the memo,
or are we talking about

a pair of k*ller
pants here?!

You knew what was out there,
and you didn't do

anything about it!

You knew?

If you hadn't hidden
that girl's death

and if you'd let me
call the police,

then they'd all
still be alive!

That is some God danged
insubordination right there.

I'm gonna have to
sanction you, young lady.

Sanction me
all you want.

I quit.
Yeah?

- Well, you're fired.
- Enough!

How many more pairs
of those jeans are there?

.

What? What? What? What?

What if more
of them are alive?
