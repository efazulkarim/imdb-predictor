Move, move, move. Tell me again why we chose this over seeing the movie. If these guys lose focus for even a millisecond... ...you have to scrape them off the fence with a shovel. You come hoping to see a crash? No, I would like to see them complete-- Of course it's to see a crash. -You're sick, Hunt. -Come on! Look, here comes Nick with our stuff. -Hey, bud. -There he is. Yes. - Hi, babe. - Hey. Oh, my God. Ha, ha. -Uh, time to lay off the Funyuns, Nicky boy. -Oh, thanks, buddy. - Ah, great. - Yeah! All right! -Oh, my God. -Oh. Here. Want a drink? -Oh. Is that straight-up Jack? -It's his buddy Jim. - Maybe later, yeah? - Hey, sport. Can my girl use your binoculars? Well, they're not really binoculars exactly. They're more-- Drink as much as you like. Go, go, go. Whoa. Easy, fellas. Craig Perry shuts the door as Mark Helfrich tries to overtake him. Hey, thanks for making me take a study break. I really, really needed this. Excuse me. Pardon me. That was a close call.. Well, great. What did I just miss? -Can you see, ma'am? -I'm sorry, not really. -Would you like me to move down a bit? -Would you mind? -Be glad to. -Thanks, man. -Thank you. -And I thought chivalry was dead. Heh. That's not true. I have my cowboy right here. Get a room, guys. Hey. Put these in. -Oh, Mom, not tampons. -Put these-- Put them in. Nick. Nick. - This tickles. - Aw, Mom. - No, no, no. - She put tampons in their ears. That's just wrong, man. I can't see now. Hey, down in front, a**hole. Approaching the halfway point. There goes the neighborhood. Sir. I need you to move your foot. Thank you. Hey, how old is this place? You got me. - Come on, let's go. - Go, go, go. Tire up. What's that? Is it safe to sit here? Of course. There's a fence there. We're fine. Relax. Replay of the Camping World Regional Series race... ...is on the Replay Race Channel at 3p.m. Did you feel that? Just now, right here. You okay? Uh, I felt something touch me. Something strange. For those of you with a business-minded head... Go, go. Come on, come on, come on. - Two's good. - Go, go, go. No, no, no, wait! The screwdriver! Sh*t! Oh. Come on, come on. Let's go, go, go! Come on. Move! Go. Get the f*** out of here. - Come on. - Boys, wait! Come on, Mom. Mom! Hey! Hey! There's an exit this way! Come on, move. -Hunt! -Janet! - Let's move. Come on. - There's an exit over here. Come on. Come on, come on! This way! Run! - Lori! - Move! Lori. Lori, come on, let's go! Get out of here! Move! Push through! Come on! Ow. Hey. What the hell? Are you okay? Nick, is there something wrong? Oh, my God, is that straight-up Jack? -No, no, it's his-- -His buddy Jim. You have been in my stash. You snake. A cowboy in a hat. He sits here. Excuse me. Pardon me. Oh, ha, ha. Cowboy. Tampons. She gets tampons. She puts them in her kids' ears. -Who? -Her, right there. Hey. Put these in your ears. - Oh, Mom, not tampons. - Put them in your ear. Hey, how did you know she was gonna do that? That's a lot of tampons for one woman. Nick? Nick. What's going on? "Down" something. "Down... Down in-- Down in front, a**hole." Down in front, a**hole. There goes the neighborhood. Sir. I need you to move your foot. Thank you. - Let's go. - Move it. Go. Pick up the tire. That's the car that's gonna crash. -We have to get out of here. -Thank God. -What? No, no. I got $500 on this race. -No one cares-- We gotta get the f*** out of here. We're gonna die. There's gonna be a crash. Hey, kid, that ain't funny. -We gotta go right now. We gotta move. -Relax, Nick. - Nick, calm down. - Oh, my God. What's your problem, bro? Get off of me, man. -Come on, let's go. -Wait. Boys, wait! I'm gonna kick your little ass, you p*ssy! Goddamn it! God, you little punk. -Andy. -Stay there. - Come back here, kid! - Hey, you little prick! - Are you out of your mind? - I saw the whole thing. -There's gonna be a crash. -Of course there's a crash. There's always a f***ing crash. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What crash? That f***ing crash. That's what crash I'm talking about. Are you shitting me? That's the reason I come to these stupid redneck things. No offense. -Sir. No, no, no-- -But my wife's in there, a**hole! - No, you can't. - Let me go! I gotta find her! - Dude, relax. - That's my wife! Let me go! Get your hands off me! Have you all lost your f***ing mind? Ew! - Here you go. - Thanks. -Just a second. -That's okay. Nick, was it like a dream or like a voice in your head? I just... I just saw it. -Can we just try to forget about it? -Are you kidding? I am never gonna get that image out of my head. -I mean, that girl's face just-- -Janet. Look, I know it's difficult. -We're all a little freaked out, okay? -But why are we still alive? Who cares why? Okay? If we made it, we deserved it. Hunt, will you give the lucky-coin sh*t a rest, please? Guys, look. - l think we should go to the memorial. - I can't. -l can't go back. -Yeah, screw that. We can pay our respects to those people. What people? People who didn't have a Dr. Xavier with them to tell them to get out of the way? People who didn't have one of these? Go ahead, Janet. Kiss it. It's your choice, heads or tails, but you know I like head. -Can't believe I ever went out with you. -Can't believe you were so lucky. Guys, look. We're here. All right? Something gave us a second chance... ...so let's be thankful and just try to make the most of it. Okay? Come on, let's go. -You okay? -Yeah. Okay. Hi. Hi, I was hoping you'd come. I wanted to thank you. You're a hero. Because of your warning, we're alive and our two sons are safe. Look, I'm not a hero, okay? I-- I didn't-- You knew. How did you know it was gonna happen? - I'm not sure. - Look, we're just glad you all are okay. Take care. Thank you. I'm glad you're safe. Thank you. Excuse me. I'm, uh, the security guard. George. Nick. Lori. -Hi. -Hi. I was pretty freaked out about that back there. -l just wanted to ask you how you-- -You killed my wife. I wanted to go in there after her, but... ...you, uh... I'm sorry for your loss. Well... ...nobody lives forever, n*gger. -Hey, there's no need for that, man. -Back off, you f***ing freak. It's time for you to leave, sir. Time? Your time's coming, chocolate. What's wrong? I just had a really bad nightmare. It's okay, it's just a dream. It seemed real. Just try to relax and go back to sleep. I'm right here. Son of a b*tch. Hey, Ma. It's late. What are you doing up? Okay. No, no, no, everything's fine. Yeah, it's fine. Okay. Time's up. Goddamn it. I'll burn you. she probably wasn't... No, no, no! F***! Help me! Help! Wake up, please, anybody! Please, I'm on fire! It's burning! Oh, my God. My ass is on fire! My ass is on fire! My God! My ass is on fire! -Hey, babe, what's up? -Hey, Lori. Turn on Channel 7 right now. You remember that redneck from the racetrack? -He's dead. -What? Yeah, hold on. --from the freak accident. Although the investigation is still ongoing... ...paramedics pronounced Daniels dead on the scene. Nick, get in here. A member of local PTA and NRA chapters... ...Carter Daniels lived quietly in Fort Wayne. Details are sketchy on how Daniels was killed. All that is known at this time is that a tow truck dragged him... ...down a residential street before the truck exploded. - Wanna hear something freaky? - Carter's wife was killed... I've seen that door before. More to come on our nightly news. And now we'll checkin with our eye in the sky... Hey, hey, I gotta go. I'll call you back. Okay, bye. What is it? What's wrong? Remember that dream I had last night? I-- I don't think it was a dream. It was like... It was like a vision. I mean, there were flames, and there was a hook... ...and that red door. And now that racist guy is dead. It was like I saw clues as to how he was gonna die. Just now I saw another one. Wait, wait, you saw how another person was gonna die? -Who was it? -I don't know. It doesn't make any sense. Nothing makes any sense. Ever since I left the racetrack, I feel like there's something in the room with me. What is happening to me? - You're early today. - Oh, yeah, light load. Hey, look. Come here. -Bet you can't hit that sign with a rock. -Okay. [BOTH GRUNT Oh, ha, ha, yeah. Okay, okay, knock it off. - Yes! - Hey. Nice one. Hey, what are you kids, stupid or something? Get out of here. Okay, come here, guys. Um-- I want you to go play video games. Come back in an hour. - All right! - You're welcome. - Thanks. - Thanks, Mom. - I'm first on "Atomic Destroyer." - No, I am. Hi, Cheyenne, I'm sorry I'm late. I had a 5:00 with Richard. Oh, you didn't get our message? -Richard's out today. -What? Someone got killed on his block. Dragged down the street on fire. -Isn't that terrible? -That's awful. So my appointment? Is there someone else that can see me? Um, it's 10 to 6, and we close at 6, so, ha-ha-ha... I understand, but the soccer game ran late, and it's girls' night out tonight... ...first time in months, and I'm so looking forward to this. -Please. Please. -Um-- -Look at this. -You're killing me. Thank you. Ah, thank you so much. Excuse me, that's-- That is a little-- That's a little tight. - Ahem. - Uh. -Sorry. -That's okay. So, Dee Dee, thank you for staying late. How long have you been cutting hair? Long enough. Goddamn chair. I've only told them to fix it like a million times. - Oh, Dee Dee? - Yeah? Could I please get some water? - No problem. - Thank you. - How's it going? - Almost done. I love the color. It's exactly honey. Do you think? I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. It won't happen again. It's okay. Wow. - Hi, Mom. - Hey. Whoa. - Oh, my God, are you okay? - Cut it out. - Thanks, Dee Dee. - You're welcome. Hope you have fun. -Stop. -Okay, guys, knock it off. I am so sorry about this. These guys aren't gonna leave my sight until I ship them to college. -Maybe military school? -Ha, yeah, maybe. All right, boys, come on. Let's go. Get in the car. I've got my eye on you two. Oh, my God! It's that lady with the kids, from the racetrack. We just lost a really hot MILF. -Dude, this is serious. -Yeah. Don't you think it's weird that two of the people Nick saved are dead? Weird is putting tampons in your kids' ears. That's weird. She was bound to die sooner or later. That's actually why we asked you guys to come over. The night before it happened, Nick had a really strange dream. Great. I'm glad I cancelled my golf game for this. Good. But it wasn't a dream. It was like these random sounds and images. They really didn't make any sense. And then I read what killed them... ...and I realized that I'd seen how the next person was gonna die. Wait, what do you mean, "the next person"? Okay, don't laugh, but we stayed up Googling premonitions... ...visions, signs, things like that, just to see how much information we could get. There are tons of articles about people... ...who had a premonition about a disaster... ...they saved themselves... ...and then they died. Okay, so people died. So what? Every survivor died. In the precise order they were meant to die in the accident. Well, we survived. So now does that mean we all die? -Well, who's next? -I don't remember. But there might be an out. Some say the chain can be broken. Like if you were to intervene into someone else's death... ...that would end it. But others say unless the chain is broken completely... ...then you're just changing the batting order, and sooner or later, you're up. That is some spooky psychobabble sh*t. shut up, please. This is not funny. -He could be watching a ton of TV. -You know what this does to me. It's okay. All we're trying to do is figure out what's going on. You are gonna have to figure that out without me. You can call me later, but I gotta go. Hope you have fun. Janet, come back. Don't leave. No, Lori. No. You guys are freaking me out. What's with that? She went from uptight but normal... ...to uptight and totally insane. Why do you gotta be a prick? She saw somebody die. - So did we. - Yeah, and we're all freaked out. Would it kill you to be sensitive? I don't know. I've never tried it. Where are you going? If you're right about this whole crash thing... ...then I'm going to make the most of every moment I have left. I'm gonna go get laid. If I'm dying, I'm trying. Keep up the good fight, guys. And if I happen to bump into Janet, I will check on her. Thanks. Well, that went well. Yeah, our friends think we're crazy. It's great. Well, maybe we are. Look, they're probably just some weird coincidences. You think? I hope so. Nick? What did you see? -l think we can stop it. -How? We gotta go to the racetrack. Oh, my God. Look at this place. All those people just... - l don't wanna be here. - I know, I know. But this is the only thing that I can think of to help me remember the order. It's over here. This is where we were. Let's see if this works. The mechanic's girlfriend dies first. Then that racist and his wife. That woman with the kids, she was next. Let's go. We shouldn't be here. Let's go. I can't remember who dies when. -It's okay. -I don't know what to do. I can't-- Maybe this was a really bad idea. No. I gotta try. You better have a damn good reason for trespassing. I just need to remember the order. Young man, that sounds crazy. But maybe this will help you. Now, this will bring up all our video cameras right here. There. That's where that guy in the mechanic jacket dies. - so he's next, then. - I think so. That collapse kills Hunt and Janet. And that's when you die. And then Lori. Then me. Maybe if we can stop this mechanic from getting killed, we can break the chain... ...and the rest of us will be safe. But how? I mean, we don't even know his name. - We know nothing about him. - But we do know where he works. Grandstate Customs. Gotta finish up that differential. Bond that to the fibreglass on it. - Done with that impact? - Yeah, hold on a second. You just want that spot-welded, right? Hey, can you give me a hand with this test probe? Good stuff, man. - Hey! - Are you okay? Who's the f***ing moron? You. What are you doing here? Trying to find you. Look, man, I'm sorry for being blunt, but your life's in danger. You're gonna die. Three of the people who left that stadium before that accident... ...they're now dead. I'm sorry, but we think that you're gonna be next. You're serious? Andy. You know you can't have these people here. Take them outside. No visitors in here. Let's go. Look, man, I'm trying to put my life back together, okay? I mean, watching Nadia die like that in front of me... Hey, I know exactly how you feel. I lost my wife and my daughter in a car accident. I was driving and I was drunk. Every day, I ask myself how come it couldn't be me instead of them. For a long time, I carried so much pain and anger... ...it was actually destroying their memory. So now I try to live each day in their name. Hey, guys, I hate to break it to you, but I'm getting a really bad feeling. Look, kid, I'm around dangerous equipment every day. If I was meant to die, it would've happened by now. Look out! - Holy sh*t. - You okay, Andy? Yeah, I'm okay. Well, I guess it's not my turn to die. Y'all take care. Holy--! You all right? Show us 20 at the body shop. Honey, I mean, if you can stop the next death-- I'm seeing clues, but I can't piece them together. - You gotta think. Who's next? - I don't know. We have to warn your friends. -How? -Well, which one is next? -They both die in the collapse. I don't know. -Nick, think. Focus. One of them had to be first, even if it was one second before the other one. Was it Hunt, or was it Janet? You gotta find Janet. I'm gonna find Hunt. Okay? Oh, God. Faster, go faster. Go faster, go faster. Pick it up, pick it up. Don't be lazy. Faster, faster. Stop moving, stop moving, stop moving. Move. Oh! No, come on. Wake up. No, we're not done. I'm not done. Come on. No, no. Are you f***ing kidding me? I finished, like, four minutes ago. -Ever play "Donkey Punch"? -Dick. Excuse me, miss, but could you help a struggling artist? Sure. -Thanks. -Have a nice day. Let's see what we got here, Browning. A penny? That's some bullshit. Oh, damn it. Great. Come on, you custom piece of sh*t. Come on, pick up the phone. Come on. Aah. Where are you at? Come on. This is Hunt. You know what to do. Hunt, listen to me, buddy, listen. No water, okay? Stay away from water. You have three messages marked urgent. That's funny, huh? -Give me the gun. -No, ha, ha. Give me the f***ing gun. No. F***ed up my phone. Sh*t. Perfect. Hey, Lori, I'm at the car wash. I'll call you back. Janet, wait. Wait. Sh*t. Do you know if there's a car wash around here? -Yeah, there's one on 18th. -We gotta go there. Yes. I own you, machine. Lori? - What's so important? - Don't go near water. What? Water? - Don't go near water! - Water? Lori? Wait. Lori? Sh*t. No service. Sh*t. Come on, come on, come on. Come on. Lord, no. Close! Oh, stop it! Oh, my God, no! Oh, God! Help me! Please! Somebody, please! Pick up the phone, Janet. Oh, God! Help! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! We're almost there. Oh, sh*t. Fore! No, no, no. - There it is. - Hurry. Go around back, George. She's in there. No! Go, go, go! Lori! Lori, get me out of here! - Sh*t. I'm coming. Just hold on. - Come on, get her out. - Lori, help me! - I'm trying! Come here, I got you. I got you. Hunt. - So do you have insurance? - Yeah. What are we supposed to do now? I mean, what's gonna happen to us? You know, saving Janet either destroyed death's list... ...and all of us are home free, or it skips her for now and then... And I'm next. George, you can't give up. -No, it's okay. -What do you mean, "it's okay"? -I mean, maybe if we all stick together-- -No, I'm at peace with it. And, um, my family's waiting for me. I'm ready to go. When we're done in here, we need to make sure to safe-proof the bedroom next. I don't understand how George can be so calm about things. -Maybe he was in shock. -No, that's not it. It was very clear. It's... It's like he just accepted it. I think he's given up. If he dies, I'm next. And when that happens, maybe you should just keep your distance. Babe, what are you talking about? Come on. I don't want anything to happen to you. And if we're together, it makes it easier for death to take both of us. I don't care what happens. We are in this together. Look. Maybe no one else has to die. We should go tell George. Hello? George. We think saving Janet broke the chain. George? -George? -George? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No. George-- Oh, my God. Are you crazy? After everything that we've been through. Why are you trying to kill yourself? Trying to give God what I thought he wanted. I've been trying to kill myself all day. Took a bottle of painkillers. I just threw them up. Then I went to the garage, hooked a hose from the tailpipe... ...stuck it inside the car, the car kept stalling. Then... So wait. Saving Janet must have destroyed the list, then. I think congratulations are in order. To breaking the chain. - Apple cider? - Thank you. -Thank God. -And a toast. Mm-hm. -To life. -To life. - To life. - Yes. Mm... We've been given a second chance. So, what are you guys gonna do with it? - I have a few plans for us, ha, ha. - Uh, oh-oh. Lots of travelling, like Paris, maybe some beaches, St.-Tropez. I'm just thankful we have our whole lives ahead of us, you know? Yeah. Now this is over, I'm not gonna take another day for granted. Ever. You know, maybe it's time to stop talking about doing stuff and actually start doing it. -You only live once, right? -That's what I'm talking about. Let me get the cookies. We made it. We did. -Hey. -Hey, babe. - Did you get the traveller's checks? - Yes, I did. Need anything from the mall? No, I think we're good. You sure you don't wanna come to the movie? -It's in 3-D. -Love Lays Dying? Yeah, I think I'll be all right. Sounds like a chickflick. But, uh, I'll have everything packed by the time you get home. Amsterdam, here we come. I can't believe we're actually going. Um, heh-- You know, Janet is so incredibly jealous. speaking of, she's walking up right now. I'm gonna run, okay? - Tell her I said hi. - I will. -Love you. -Love you too. Be home soon. - Bye. - Bye. -Hi. -Hi, ha, ha. John Doe, the unknown survivor of the speedway crash... ...has finally been named now that his family's been notified. Jonathan Groves was rescued in the rubble. George, how fast can you meet me at the hospital? Look, man, we got the order wrong. Remember that guy who sat in front of me? The cowboy? He didn't die, which means he's next. Look, just be there in five. I'm on my way. You feeling okay, Mr. Suby? Ha. Why do you care? You know how many of your kind I killed in Korea? -I'm Chinese, sir. -Ha, same difference. I need you in PT 3 right now. - Okay. - And I do mean now. - Okay. - Thank you. Be back in a few minutes to get you into that tub. Dr. Helfrich to Obstetrics. Hey. Somebody. Hey. Help. Forgot to turn the water off. Help. Help. Somebody help. - Dr. Finn, extension 2861. - Somebody help. Dr. Finn, extension 2861. George. George. Where's Lori? I've been calling and texting all afternoon. She's not picking up. Maybe it won't matter. Come on. How can there be someone else on the list? He didn't leave the racetrack with us. If I would've asked him to move like in the premonition, he would've died. He survived. That's why you couldn't kill yourself. You weren't next, he was. It wasn't destined at all. So if he dies, I'm next again. Great, man. - Excuse me. - Dr. Taylor to Pathology. Dr. Sheila Taylor to Pathology. Yeah. -Those are really hot. -Yes. I love these. I like how they-- -Oh! -Aah! What the hell? Ow! Ugh, hey. Stop-- That's genius. Someone could get killed. -Man, I'm feeling something. -Don't lose hope, man. If we keep an eye out for signs of danger, I think we got a shot. -Let's just go find Lori and Janet. -No, no, not that. I mean, it's like dej vu. My wife said that dej vu is like God's way of-- - Oh, my goodness. Hurry, let's go. - Okay. - Oh, thank you very much. - Okay, thanks. Hi. Do you have these in a six? Yes, we bring them in fresh every day. - Hello. - Oh! -Cool, let's go. -What do you think? Ah... Well, they're cute yet functional. I like them. They say, "I'm getting older, but I still like to party." Ha, ha. Ha, ha, I didn't buy them for you, I bought them for Nick. He likes me in sneaks. Yeah, just get a 2-by-48. Right off the corner brace? Check the measurement. It's not fitting. Those windows won't pass. Yeah, 90 on that. Yeah, that looks fine. Go ahead and nail it off, it's level. Yeah, around the corner. - Lunch, boys. - Okay. Back in an hour. Is that yoghurt place still open? - Yeah, I think they're still here. - Wait. My shoelace is caught. - What? - My shoelace is stuck. - Oh, okay, here. - Just help me get it out. - Look, I'm gonna grab your-- - It's not coming out, though, Janet. -Don't freak out. -Pull my leg harder. Help me try to get it out. It's not coming loose. - I am trying. I'm pulling. - It's twisting my ankle. Ow! Ow! F***. I should've seen that one coming. -Are you okay? -Yeah, I'm okay. Here's two for Love Lays Dying. Enjoy the show. - Thank you. - Thanks. -Hi, ladies. -Hello. -Theatre 13, second door on your left. -Thanks. - So, what do you want? - I don't know. Where the hell you going? Go. Go now. Cut him off. - Are you f***ing nuts? - It's just up ahead. Hold on, pumpkin. We'll be there in no time. That's really cool. - Down in front, a**hole. - That's so ridiculous. sir, move your feet. Put these in your ears. It's gonna get loud. What do you mean? Look, don't get mad at me... ...but do you remember when Nick said that he could see signs... ...before something bad was gonna happen? Well, now I think I'm seeing them. Lori, it's over. Nothing is gonna happen. - Now can we please watch the movie? - I'm going. Are you kidding me? - Everybody off - We'll never make it. It's gonna blow. Lori. Lori. - Lori! - Shut up, man. Bye-bye, suckers. "Dixieland." -Something's wrong. -No kidding. -The person next to me won't shut up. -No, I'm serious. Something's wrong. Things are happening just like at the track. -Lori, you in here? -Nick. -It's not over. -What? George is dead. Janet, come on. We have to leave right now. No. No, I can't keep doing this, okay? You're both nuts. -Janet, we gotta go. Come on. -No. Don't you see? This is where I was supposed to be in the first place, not that race. -Come on. Come on. -I was meant to see this movie. Bye-bye, suckers. Janet! Lori, come on! Find the way to the exit. Remain calm. Everything's gonna be okay. Let's go! Let's go! - I got you. - Pull me up! Pull me up! Nick! Nick! - Help me! Help me! - Hold on! Hold on! -Climb up my arm! -Don't let me go! Climb up my arm! No! Hold on, I got you. I got you. No, no, no! Lori, no! Lori, no! I mean, it's dej vu. -My wife said that dej vu is God's way-- -Look out! - Hurry. - Get some help! - Help. - Over here! Lori. Hey, watch it. Down in front, a**hole. Hey, come on, man. - Watch out. - Hey. Hey, come on. Janet, something's wrong. Come on, come on, come on. Uh, damn it. F***! Oh! We were wrong about the order. What if we're wrong about the chain? Then we wouldn't be here at all. And yet here I am, trying to watch a movie... ...despite my best friend going crazy next to me. Oh, f***. Oh, sh*t. Sh*t. It's gonna blow. Move it! Come on. Come on. Bye-bye, suckers. I guess this is how I'm gonna be remembered. Thanks. Try to tie it off right there. That's good. Just this side of the Union City. Hey, man, excuse me. Is this thing supposed to be this way? - Isn't it supposed to be screwed tighter? - You're right. Tell you what, we'll get somebody on that. -Pays to be safe, man. Trust me. -Yeah. That's one down. You wanna meet up with them now? -Small mint tea. -Thanks. - Small latte for you. - Thank you. And for me... Um, what the hell is that? A giant chococcino with whipped cream, chocolate syrup, caramel and sprinkles. That looks disgusting. Yeah. I'm going into a diabetic coma just looking at it. Well, what can I say, ladies? It looked good. Yeah, but it tastes totally disgusting. Say, you're the guy who stopped that mall fire, aren't you? You saved a lot of lives, man. I was just at the right place at the right time.

SCIENTIST’S VOICE

Experiment 208, day 20...

INT. SCIENTIST’S LAB - DAY

We see an early incarnation of a MACHINE (this will be theinner brain of the FABRICATION MACHINE). We see the scientist, in a white coat.

We pull back to see the Scientist is playing a complicatedMULTI-LEVEL 3-D chess game on a MULTI-LEVEL GAME BOARD with

the MACHINE. The Scientist makes an elaborate multi-level

move. The Machine reaches an arm out into the chess game butthen malfunctions and strews the game everywhere.

We pull back further to see the back and legs of the DICTATOR, with black-uniformed soldiers flanking him. The

regime’s emblem can be seen on the uniforms.
awakened him.

He is made up of odd patchwork items: burlap, a thick zipper,

big round gas-mask eyes (which we recognize as what we saw

before, in the title sequence).

We pull around to see the number "9" painted on his back.

We pull back further to see...

SEQ. 020 - INT. RUINED WORKSHOP - EERIE, INDETERMINATE

DAYLIGHT:

...he is on the tabletop in the RUINS OF A SMALL ROOM.

Splintered BITS OF WALL jut up to the open sky. Rotted

FLOORBOARDS are BENT and WARPED. The room is full of years

of DUST and ROT. Dust hangs in the feeble rays of dirty

sunlight.

The table and floor are covered with the same kinds of scraps

and raw materials from which “9” is made: burlap, hinges,

bits of Machinery.

"9" blinks and turns around, his head darting this way and

that, trying to make sense of his surroundings.

He walks over to the edge of the tabletop. He peers over, and

sees...

...the SCIENTIST LYING DEAD ON THE FLOOR.

Slumped on the floor, we clearly see: the scientist’s

skeletal hand is clutching a tiny box.

He hears a clattering sound and turns to see

A loose window shutter. He goes over to the window.

He pushes opens the window to see-

SEQ. 020 - EXT. STREET - INDETERMINATE DAYLIGHT

...AN APOCALYPTIC WASTELAND.

Rusting machine carcasses, bombed-out ruins, and emptiness

stretch as far as he can see.

Terrible, life-ending destruction.

There is no other living being anywhere.

9 stares in disbelief and horror and fear. He can’t make any

sense of it... or the room... or the endless miles of

lifeless wasteland stretching out in front of him.

He seems to be completely alone.

9 sees a glint of something, a possible sign of life. He

moves to go outside.

8.

He stops and is strangely drawn to the TALISMAN. He turns

and takes it, stowing it inside his zippered chest before heheads out.

SEQ. 029 - 9 Meets 2

SEQ. 029 - EXT. WASTELAND - DAY

9 moves warily in the dusty, grim light, along the desertedRUINS of the outside streets. It is the remains of war.

Pulverized HULKS of BUILDINGS, torn-open suitcases, scatteredclothes, rusting cars and the grim debris of humancivilization surround him.

He sees a dead body slouched next to a suitcase in the frontseat of a car.

Banners hang on the buildings with a three prong symbol onthem.

Machines lie deserted on the sides of roads.

Distracted by the spectacle, 9 stumbles and lands on a raggedold flyer: REVOLT! He looks back at the War Machines and

Dictator flags. He sees a vandalized poster of what appearsto be a dictator/leader.

9 looks around him, trying to piece together what happened.

Suddenly there is a clanking sound in front of him.

9 sees a light flicker on in the shattered hulk of a warMachine.

CLOSE on 9 as the light crosses his face.

Scared, he ducks behind a huge piece of debris. 9 grabs apiece of metal lying in front of him.

The shadow moves closer, 9 shakes nervously. The figureemerges with spear in hand and 9 swings the weapon at himwith all his might.

9 hits him square in the chest. It is another ragdoll: 2. 2is propelled backwards and falls to the ground on the debrisbehind him. 9 quickly tries to hide.

9.

But 2 is looking at 9 with surprise. He struggles to get up,

speaking with urgency to 9.

2

(firmly, kindly, almosteagerly; like trying tosoothe a wild animal)

Wait... I am a friend.

ALT:

2 (cont’d)

(gently)

Friend... I am a friend.

9 now sees he has hit a ragdoll, similar to himself. He

hesitates, not sure what to make of this. 2 extends his

hand, calmly, eagerly. 9 hesitates again, then, still timid,

but showing a little bravery, drops his weapon and goes tohelp 2 up.

We see that 2 is much older, much more decrepit, much moreprimitively constructed: he is made from patchwork bits ofOLD LEATHER SHOES. A SHOELACE stitches up his front and istied in a bow at his neck. Bits of leather FRAY off him.

His feet are primitive small HINGES. Half of a pair ofeyeglasses, like an enormous MONOCLE, is attached to 2's hat.

9 helps straighten 2’s monocle. 2 smiles at him. We see

that 2 is like a wise mentor, a kindly professor with acontagious eagerness and imaginativeness.

2 peers eagerly at 9. He circles 9 and spots the number onhis back.

2 (cont’d)

(eagerly, excited, like an

intrigued scholar)

Yes... yes... I always thought

there’d be one more.

He nods and smiles. He extends his hand to shake 9’s hand.

While doing this, he takes 9’s hand and studies it, noddingwith eager excitement. We see that 9’s hand is more

sophisticated than 2’s.

2 (cont’d)

The details... how exciting.

(fascinated)

Carved wood... steel bolts...

molded copper...

10.

2 turns slightly, and 9 sees his number and tries to say it.

But no sound comes out of his mouth.

2 looks at him, nodding, again, the kind mentor. He’s

interested, observing without judging; curious, kindly andready to help.

2 (cont’d)

You can’t speak.

With a friendly, disarming smile, he taps 9’s zipper. 9

unzips himself and 2 peers in. 2 looks up, happy that he canhelp.

2 (cont’d)

Yes, yes...

2 looks around nervously and hurries over to his roller-skatecart covered with detritus - odds and ends, a broken chinadoll.

2 (cont’d)

...come with me.

9 follows, looking around curiously.

2 finds the china doll.

2 (cont’d)

Here!

As 2 rummages through the chest of the china doll 9 picks upa bullet casing from 2's cart and starts tapping it. 2 turns

with the doll's voice box in his hand.

2 (cont’d)

(sees 9 with the bullet;

whispers sharply)

No! Stop!

2 eases the bullet away from 9, then smiles gently at 9,

explaining:

2 (cont’d)

(quietly)

Some things in this world are

better left where they lie.

He puts the bullet to one side and kneels, prying into 9'schest. 2 begins to connect the doll's voice box.

11.

2 (cont’d)

But if you know where to look,

these ruins are full of riches.

2 concentrates, a look of pleasure on his face as he twists afew more wires. Static and unclear sound come out at first,

but as 2 tunes the voice further...

9

(as his voice is “tunedin”.. starting with purestatic, then slowlymoving into a voice)

Chhhhhhh.....chhhhehhhh...

2

Wait..

(tunes him in)

...almost there...

9 gets a little panicky look on his face at the strangesounds coming out of him. 2 puts a calm hand on hisshoulder. 9 calms down and tries again.

9

Friend? Friend?

2

(beaming)

Friend.

9

(more and more normal

sounding)

Are we alone?

2

(reassuring)

No. There are others.

9 and 2 stare at each other. 9 looks at 2 in wonderment,

then reaches out and touches 2’s chest where he hit it.

2 beams at 9, happy 9 can speak, happy he was able to help,

and happy that 9, with his first words, is concerned aboutothers.

A glow beams from within 9's chest. 2 stares. 9 removes the

TALISMAN from his chest.
2 has a big reaction--he draws his breath in and looks at it

in ASTONISHMENT.

12.

He takes it and looks at it. He gives 9 a look of surprise.

2 (cont’d)

But how strange....

(muttering to himself ashe turns the Talisman in

his hands)

Yes, he was always drawing this...

exactly like this... how strange...

They both stare at the TALISMAN.

Suddenly, a is heard OFFSCREEN. 2 looks up INHORROR. He grabs his spear. He pushes 9 away almostfiercely.

ALT:

2 (cont’d)

(firmly, to 9)

GO!
SEQ. 030 - Cat Beast Attacks

SEQ. 030 - EXT. WASTELAND - DAY

2 points forcefully to an old rusted can.

9 runs into the can.

2 stands, ready to attack.

9 watches 2, wondering what is coming. Then from behind him,

a large claw of a mechanical figure settles softly next to

9’s can. He tries to call out to 2...

And from behind 2 enters-

A HIDEOUS CAT BEAST.

It is a nail and razor-studded predatory Machine with a cat

skull-shaped head, its body laced with bones, nails and

razors. 9 now understands 2 was trying to protect him.

2 GASPS as he turns and sees it. The Cat Beast lets out a

roar and claws at 2, KNOCKING him over and losing his spear.

9 looks on with horror.

13.

2 attempts to reach for his spear but the Beast holds himdown with its razor-sharp feet.

The Beast is attracted to the Talisman. It picks it up withone of its jagged claws and looks at it quizzically.

9 cringes. His movement makes his hiding place teeter,

creaking.

The Cat Beast WHIRLS at the sound. Picking up 2’s strugglingbody, the Cat Beast stalks towards the noise, right up to 9’shiding place, sniffing through its hollow nostrils. 9

cringes in terror. The Cat Beast probes with one of hisclaws INTO the tin can. 9 recoils. The claws do not find

him and retreat. 9 is relieved.

A beat, then:

9 feels himself violently LIFTED UP and SMASHED.

We see the Cat Beast has picked up the entire tin can and issmashing it to get at what’s inside it. Failing, it hurlsthe tin can aside.

9 is almost knocked out. Trying to stay conscious, hestruggles towards the entrance of the can.

His POV:
through his haze and through the broken edges of the

opening to the can, he sees the Cat Beast GRAB the Talismanand the struggling 2 in his sharp-toothed mouth, anddisappearing into the smoky mist.

9 can just make out, in the distance, the silhouettes of

THREE TALL SHAPES.

9

(muttering)

Yes... he told me there were

others...

5

(suddenly, urgently)

Who?

9

(still dazed, trying to

remember)

He was older... Out there...

5

2. Out in the emptiness?

(horrified)

Alone? Was he all right?

When is he coming back?

15.

9 looks at him, the whole memory suddenly coming back to himas though fresh.

9

The--the-(

can’t think of the right

Thing! It took him.

5 reacts with horror.

5

No... No! It can’t be!

He turns away, grief-stricken.

1 (O.S.)

Keeping secrets from me, I see.

Another RAGDOLL pushes into the workroom. This is a biggerragdoll, the most primitive one we have seen. He has

primitive wooden hinges for feet. He is very frayed andpatched together. The number 1 is painted on his back.

5 and 9 whirl around. 5 CRINGES.

5

I... I was coming to tell you...

1 carries himself with authority. He wears a red cloak, and

a strange mother of pearl and wire hat bound together as analmost papal-like headpiece, and carries a staff made from anold gear, with a bell attached.

1 pulls at 9 with his staff, displaying the number on hisback.

1

What’s this?

1 turns and glares at 5 like a general glaring at a newprivate, expecting an explanation for a misdeed. 5 cringesback, obviously intimidated by 1.

5

I... I found him.... in the

emptiness. He saw-

1 HOOKS 5 by the neck with his staff, cutting off his speech.

1

What? What were you doing out

there?

16.

5

I saw him from the watchtower and I

thought...

1

You’ll lead The Beast straight backto us! How many times have I toldyou?

9

The Beast--that’s what took 2! If

we hurry we could save him-

1

(curtly)

If the Beast took him, that’s theend of it.

9

But he was still alive-

5 turns with sudden hope to 9. 2 might still be alive?

1

No, we have RULES.

1 smashes his staff against the ground.

Immediately, a knife comes through the curtain revealinganother RAGDOLL: a large ragdoll, with the number “8” on his

arm.

1 (cont’d)

(to 8)

Our new guest seems confused.

(condescendingly, to 9)

Perhaps I can help you achieve someclarity.

8 is very large, and designed for great strength. He is

almost as evolved in his design as 9, but his design favorsprimarily brute force.

He has armored himself with curved pieces of tin and metal.

He carries the blade of a large kitchen knife, with a nail hehas attached for a handle. On his back he has slung anotherknife--half of a scissors; the scissors handle loops up above

his head.

Hmmmph!

5 quickly stops talking. 9, following his lead, stopstalking also.

The group gets into a bucket-like device. 8 pushes 9 hard

into the bucket.

1 NODS commandingly to 8. 8 begins to crank a rope that

lifts them up. 5 gestures to 9 to hold on.

9 braces himself as 8 pulls them up into a tall tower. He

steals a glance at 1. 1 frowns. 9 tries to smile.

They pass an old plane outside that has crash-landed in to

the Cathedral.

On the side wall is a round, multi-colored stained glasswindow. Shafts of different colored sunlight flickerthrough.

The bucket moves past two large church bells into-...

Ragdolls 2, 5, 6, 8, and 1 hide under an old helmet,

frantically trying to escape the explosions BURSTING aroundthem. 7 appears with 3 and 4. We get the sense that 7 isthe reckless one, the only one determined to SCOUT AROUND andsee what’s out there.

7

(to 1)

I found others...

They are welcomed in by the other dolls. They turn to 1, whois clearly the leader, to see what to do next. 1 decides: he

points forward, and they all run a few feet while underneaththe helmet.

A plane crashes in the background, causing 5 to fall behind(he has both eyes).

Through a dirty MIST we see War Machines enter with their

weapons.

A RESISTANCE FIGHTER throws a Molotov cocktail at one of the

Machines. It turns and SHOOTS a round of gunfire.

A MUSTARD GAS BOMB is launched from the top of the Machine.

It heads straight at 5 but he runs and gets KNOCKED to theground, barely missing it.

The bomb lets out a yellow CLOUD that envelops the area andKILLS PLANTS ON CONTACT.

7 turns and sees 5 lying face-down on the ground. 1 urgesher to stay with the others.

19.

But, again, brave and slightly reckless, she runs through theyellow cloud to help him. She brings him back to the group.

His left eye is damaged. The others cower. 2, the gentlementor of the group, puts a comforting hand on 5’s damaged

eye. 7, always the scout, brave and fearless, points off tothe right, and addresses 1. She knows what’s out there;

she’s seen it.

There’s a path ahead-

1 looks around calculatingly, like Patton: the general takingcharge. He thinks, judiciously, then:

But where did it come from? Why isit hunting us?

Questions like that are pointless.

We need to protect ourselves. Keepourselves out of danger.

5 meekly immediately obeys, gesturing to 9 to follow him.

We hear a strange WHISPERING SOUND, and CAMERA, instead offollowing 5 and 9, stays behind and moves in on a shadowylittle area. There, we see 6. 6 is ink-stained and has a

9 is pointing to the lightbulb.

5 can’t help himself. He pulls the lightbulb out, pulls outa battery and electrical wire from his chest, winds the wirearound the battery and places it inside the hat.

They screw the lightbulb and it LIGHTS UP. 5 can’t helpsmiling at 9.

9 unwinds the wire holding the blade on 2’s staff. He places2’s hat on the end of 2’s staff and secures it with the

blade. 5 nods, intrigued.

5

Yes... yes... good....

He sees that 9 now has made a LIGHTSTAFF. He blurts out:

5 (cont’d)

2 will be so impressed!

A terrible grief suddenly comes over him as he remembers whathas happened to 2.

9 puts his hand on 5’s shoulder, bracing him.

9

(firmly)

Yes. He will.

9 is conveying with his simple words that he believes 2 ISstill alive and he WILL be impressed when he sees thelightstaff.

9 shines the light to gesture “this way.”

5 smiles tremulously at 9, almost more grateful for hissympathy and support than necessarily believing him. He

follows 9 to the mouth of the trench.

The camera pans over to reveal catlike scratchmarks on a side

wall indicating this is the same trench we saw the Cat Beasttravel through earlier.

5 recoils, but 9 puts a calming hand on him again, then putsboth hands on the lightstaff and enters the trench. 5 takes

a deep breath and follows.

A enormous, destroyed old stone building, itscaved-in ceiling revealing huge boilers, scarred old metalwalkways and catwalks dangling, dust-covered rotting turbinesexposed to the elements.

SEQ. 080 - INT. FACTORY - CONTINUOUS

They creep into the enormous hulk of a building.

In the center of the building are the splintered vestiges of

an enormous

ASSEMBLY LINE:

Enormous metal arms lie motionless. Huge steel hooks towerover the belt, with sharp-edged pieces of Machinery danglingfrom them.

They look around in horror.

Large pieces of Machinery, pipes, and ducts dangle from theceilings. Layers of dust cover everything like eerieblankets. Bundles of wires lie ripped from their moorings.

Tools and shards of glass and metal are strewn around thefloor, twisted into strange melted shapes.

They walk through lines of large missiles lined up in rows.

5 (cont’d)

(whispering)

Why would it bring him here?

They slide down a duct and land in a pile of debris. Theynow see 2, imprisoned in an old birdcage. In the b.g., the

CAT BEAST lurks, next to a pile of what seems like debris andbroken machinery. The talisman is on the floor next to the

Cat Beast. The Cat Beast seems to be looking for somethingin the debris. The Cat Beast’s back is to us 30.

SEQ. 081 - INT. FACTORY - CONTINUOUS

9 and 5 hurry forward towards 2.

They find 2, seemingly lifeless.

5 (cont’d)

(deep regret)

I shouldn’t have waited...

9 stands compassionately, respecting 5’s grief. 5 pats 2’sshoulder.

At the pat, 2 blinks awake.

2

(whispers)

I knew you would come...

5

I thought-2

(cutting him off)

Shhh...

He motions towards the Beast.

5 and 9 try to pry the bars open. 2 tries to help. They

just manage to pry the bars open and get 2 out when-Suddenly

a light SHINES above them. They look up and see -The

Cat Beast beaming his light from his eye. It GROWLS.

The three dolls run away frantically. The Cat Beast chases

after them.

9 gets cornered but swipes the Beast and manages to escape.

9 jumps a heap of debris but stumbles. 5 and 2 pull him up

to higher ground.

5 shoots his crossbow at the Cat Beast, shattering his eye.

2 manages to hide in a tube.

9 and 5 run away but get stuck at the end of a table.

The Cat Beast slashes his claw at them.

31.

They climb onto another piece of debris, only to encounterthe Cat Beast, now in front of them.

The Cat Beast slashes a claw out and knocks them over. The

Cat Beast moves closer and closer. They are doomed.

Suddenly there is a strange rhythmic moaning sound. The Cat

Beast turns, distracted.

We pan over and see a mysterious creature that seems to behalf ragdoll, half bird, with a bird-skull head swinging aweapon over its head. THIS IS 7. 7 releases the weapon--astrap of leather with weighted shot at either end. The

weapon flies through the air with a low whooshing sound andstrikes the Cat Beast, entangling it.

7, 5, and 9 now charge the Cat Beast. 5 shoots his crossbow,

entangling the Beast’s paw and hobbling it. 9 and 2 both

LURE THE CAT BEAST IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS, deliberatelygoading and further causing it to become entangled in themachinery. 7 now leaps up over the Beast and brings thefull weight of her spear down on the Cat Beast’s neck. The

head of the Beast comes off and lands at their feet.

7 now pulls off her bird-skull helmet.

5

7!

2

You weren’t lost-

5

You’ve come back!

7

I never left. YOU finally decidedto join the fight.

She hands 5’s map back to him.

9 comes over with her shield (lost during the fight). 7

looks 9 over.

7 (cont’d)

I think I know why.

They move towards her but she turns and looks at 9. 2 and 5

nod proudly towards 9. 7 nods.

They all look at the fallen Cat Beast.

2 is poking at it:

32.

2

Rusty... hacked together... shoddypile of scrap.

They all turn to leave. 5 and 7 support 2 on either side ofhim, helping 2 along. 9 hangs back to look at the machineagain, and suddenly sees the TALISMAN, lying on the floor.

5, 7, and 2 have continued on without him and do not see himas he picks it up.

9 looks at the strange object with ENORMOUS CURIOSITY. He

turns it and see the RUNES on the side of it. He turns and

inspects it closely. He turns and discovers, on themachine, a PORT with the SAME RUNES.

9

(blurting out)

Look!

The others now turn to see him. They see him holding thetalisman close to the machine’s port... about toexperimentally put the talisman INTO the port.

2

No! Stop! NO!

2 tries to break free and stagger towards him but it is toolate. 9 puts the talisman into the port.

Nothing happens for a moment.

Then suddenly, horribly, the ground begins to SHAKE.

SEQ. 082 - Fabrication Machine

SEQ. 082 - INT. FACTORY - CONTINUOUS

Suddenly the Cat Beast’s dead body begins to SHIFT andMOVE... There is a rumbling from beneath it as...

... a LARGE FORM rises up from under the debris.

ANGLE on the machine awakening: movement under the cloth, aclaw-like appendage rising from the rubble.

7

Quickly! Run! Get away!

33.

They try to climb to safer ground from the tumbling debris.

2 is thrown back and LANDS hard.

A mechanical ARM emerges and PINS 7, 9, and 5.

As dust and debris rain down, we see one hideous RED EYEbegin to come up.

As 2 tries to scramble to safety, the other three ragdolls,

pinned by the mechanical arm, stare in horror. We see that

the “pile of Machinery” has risen to reassemble into anmonstrous, towering FABRICATION MACHINE attached to theceiling of the building.

It is enormous, a spherical shape with a dozen foldedappendages, each with different fabrication tools at the endof its long spindly robotic arms.

2 tries to crawl away but the Machine grabs him with hisrobotic arm.

The Machine points the talisman towards 2 and it OPENS up toa sparking green glow. 2 struggles in the Machine’s claw butthe strange green energy SHOOTS directly into 2’s mouth andeyes, painfully his soul.

ANGLE on 2 as his soul is being taken.

2 slumps over, his LIFELESS CARCASS smoking in the grip ofthe Machine.

ANGLE on the green glow as it PASSES into the machine. The

sound has drawn its attention. The Machine turns towards

them and grabs at them with its enormous claw. 9, 5, and 7turn and flee.

The Fabrication Machine’s arms chase after them. 5 shoots

his grappling hook onto a switch. 9 and 7 grab onto him.

Frantically working together, the three of them manage toescape the Machine’s horrifying arms. [**Important to makesure the Machine is understood to be tethered to the

Factory.]

They see in the distance a pipe that leads out.

In the Machine’s RED POV, they run into it just as the

Machine’s arm is behind them but can’t fit into the hole.

They enter the ruins of an old library.

Giant stacks of random, tattered, stained books, globes, andcelestial devices tower over them. Dusty rays of light beamdown through broken glass skylights, casting filtered lighton shelves and shelves of old tomes, papers, and crumblingartifacts.

9 stops to look at a beautiful painting, showing life and theworld before the apocalypse.

9

(whispering to himself)

So beautiful...

7 grabs the lightstaff from 9 and shines it towards a pile ofbooks. A glimmer of two sets of eyes appear and disappear.

7 holds her hand up, gesturing to 9 to hold still.

3 & 4 emerge from their globe. 5 smiles.

We need you--we awakened something-

9 interrupts her to take full responsibility for the mistake.

9

I awakened something. In the

3 and 4 look at each other WITH HORROR. They begin tochatter feverishly and with great distress.

They beam an image of THE FABRICATION MACHINE on the wall.

5 and 9 lean forward, startled.

9 (cont’d)

(recognizing it)

That’s it!

7

What is it?

3 and 4 now show:

A NEWSPAPER PHOTOGRAPH of the Scientist and the Machine

(which we recognize from before, in the prologue, when theScientist gave the machine to the Dictator and we saw theFLASH of the flashbulb).

We now push into the photo to a CLOSE UP on the machine.

37.

Then dissolve into a NEWSREEL of the machine and see:

--the original machine being wired into the FABRICATIONMACHINE

--Dutch-angle shots of the Dictator, and we hear his SPEECH--

DICTATOR:

...yes, we have entered a newfuture, the age of the intelligentmachine. This remarkable invention

can adapt and evolve, creating newmachines, machines of

--STILL PHOTOS showing the war, the machines getting more andmore devious, chasing a mother and child down an alley, moreand more machines appearing.

--SHAKY, HAND-HELD AMATEUR footage showing the GAS KILLINGEVERYTHING. The footage ends with the camera sinking to theground as whoever is operating it is overcome by gas.

--ending on a STILL PHOTO that we pan across, showing TOTAL

7 shakes her head sadly and impatiently. 5 suddenly turns to

9 quickly sketches out a drawing of the TALISMAN and shows itto the twins.

3 and 4 chatter, trying to analyze and catalogue the drawingof the Talisman. They shake their heads: they don’trecognize it.

Seeing it as a drawing, 5 is startled.

5 (cont’d)

Wait! 6... he always draws that.

2 used to keep the drawings... withhis notes....

9 looks at 5.

9

The drawings... would they still be

Yes.

Then we’ll go back. Perhaps theanswer is there.

5 looks alarmed and looks over at 7. 7 shakes her head.

7

I think the answer is there.

She points out towards the factory and strides off,

5 and 9 bend over the drawings. They are unable to seeclearly in the murky darkness. 9 looks around warily, thenswitches on his light.

5, 6, 8 and 9 see the Winged Beast emerge from the smokepouring out of the upset thurible.

The Winged Beast SHRIEKS at them. It catches its foot on the

runner leading up to 1’s empty throne. The hymnboard/

calendar topples away to reveal 1 hiding behind it. 1instinctively clutches his staff causing the bell at the topof the staff to RING and attracting the Winged Beast’sattention.

1 flees. 8 charges the Beast but it SCYTHES its wing towardshim and knocks 8 across the floor. 8 slides across the floor

to 1, who stands next to 6’s picture of the Cat Beast.

1 pushed the picture of the Cat Beast away to reveal a HIDDENPASSAGEWAY. 1 runs away as 8 looks at the others for a briefmoment before also running away.

The Winged Beast turns its attention to 9, 5, and 6. The

ragdolls run for the bucket and bell-ropes, but 9 trips. The

Winged Beast advances towards him. 5 reaches out to 9. 9

gestures to him to continue without him.

As 9 recovers himself and makes a break for the bucket, 5starts to lower the bucket down. Just as the Winged Beast isabout to catch up with him, 9 LEAPS down the shaft and landsin the bucket with 5 and 6.

Angrily, the Beast lashes its harpoon tail down at them,

piercing the bottom of the bucket. The bucket rocks and 6 is

sent FLYING OUT but 5 CATCHES him in the nick of time.

43.

The Winged Beast starts reeling its harpoon tail in. Jerkingback and forth, the bucket ascends, drawing the ragdollscloser and closer to the Beast.

9 spots a SMALL LEDGE next to a stained glass window.

He opens the side of the bucket and gestures that they shouldjump.

The others hesitate, but then 9, 6, and 5 jump out of thebucket onto a swinging rope, and onto the ledge. The WingedBeast plummets down the shaft after them.

SEQ. 140 - EXT. CATHEDRAL/CLOCKTOWER - CONTINUOUS

The ragdolls squeeze through a small crack in the stainedglass emerging onto a ledge overlooking the Cathedral’s roof.

9 sees 1 and 8 running across the roof and points to 5 and 6to look down there. Down on the roof, 1 and 8 see 5, 6, and

9. 1 pushes past 8 and runs farther out, towards the frontof the Cathedral. 8 follows.

Suddenly, the Winged Beast SMASHES through the glass behindthem. It struggles to get through the window but can’t quitefit.

6 is very vulnerable out there.

9 turns to 5.

9

Take him inside.

9 now climbs out on the gargoyle purposefully.

The Winged Beast FLIES UP into the air, circling lazily. 1

and 8, running on the top of the roof, are very exposed.

Hawklike, the Winged Beast sails towards them.

8 steps up to defend 1. He flips his salt-shaker helmet downover his face as armor, pulls out his scissor knife andstands his ground... waiting... waiting for the Winged Beastto soar in closer...

And then, at the last possible moment, he HURLS his scissorknife at the Winged Beast. It flies through the air andcatches in the Beast’s propeller.

Knocked off balance, the Beast swoops down. 1 ducks out of

the way but it knocks 8 off his feet. 8 slides down the

sloped edge of the roof, towards GAPING HOLE.

Just as 8 is about to fall into the hole, he catches on tothe edge. His other blade plummets through the hole as hehangs, desperately... his grip SLIPPING...

9 catches up to where 1 is.

scowls, but has no alternative but to help him.

9 peels back a piece of the roof, with 1 helping him. The

8 falls onto and then slides down the harpoon’s line,

swinging into the Cathedral and landing on the wing of theairplane embedded in the side of the Cathedral, right next to5 and 6. 8’s weight on the harpoon’s line has pulled it moreand more taut...

The Winged Beast is pulled hard into the roof and slidesdown, knocking into 1 and 9.

1 and 9 PLUNGE into the Cathedral and onto the plane wing,

where 8 catches them in midair before they hit the wing.

45.

The Winged Beast plummets after them onto the wing. It picksitself up, spots the cowering ragdolls, and opens up hisbladed beak screaming.

The Winged Beast starts to charge them when suddenly-

7 DROPS DOWN from a high parapet and leaps onto the WingedBeast’s neck.

1 and 8 stare in surprise. 9 stares in delight and relief.

1

(stunned and surprised)

7?

Immediately, the beast throws her off towards the others.

She’d dropped her spear; she goes to pick it up and

immediately, her leg is IMPALED by the WingedBeast, which has fired its harpoon. She is impaled next tothe guys.

7

(lightly)

I thought you might need some help.

But as she speaks, the Beast begins to reel her in. She

fights viciously.

9 jumps and grabs on to 7 as she’s being pulled away.

7 (cont’d)

(yelling)

My spear!

5 grabs her forked spear and hands it to her. She grabs herforked spear and stabs it into the plane. The harpoon’scable is pulled taut between her leg and the Winged Beast.

9

(yelling to the others)

The cable! Cut it!

8 runs to recover the blade that slipped from his grasp as heslid down the roof, then runs over and SLICES with all hisbrute force through the cable. The cable flies up in the airand WRAPS itself around the propeller on the end of the wing.
The Winged Beast jerks back, towards the propeller, causingthe whole wing of the plane to tilt, and the ragdolls toslide. 5 and 6 tumble into the plane’s engine room.

46.

7 clutches her staff. 9 slides by her and grabs on to theharpoon, still lodged in her leg.

9’s staff slides by, and 9 catches it just before it fallsoff the wing. As 8 climbs up onto the same buttress fragmentthat 7’s spear is lodged in, 1 slides down the wing, past 9.

The propeller! Start the

propeller!

6 nods. 5 points to the wires. 5 and 6 gather wires and setto work. They ZAP the propeller to life and it GROANS... thenwhines into motion as it starts taking up the power it hadgenerated. It goes faster... faster...

Even as the Beast is slowly drawn towards the propeller, itstruggles forward and grabs 1’s cape in its beak.

As the Winged Beast pulls 1 closer, 9 strains to hang on to1, and 7 strains with the added weight on the harpoonsticking out of her wounded leg.

1

My... my cape!

9

Let it go!

1 glares furiously, hesitates, then undoes the clasp. TheWinged Beast falls backwards down the wing, DIRECTLY INTO THEDEADLY BLADES.

It is instantly shredded.

Claws, feathers, and strange mechanical debris shower down.

1, 9, and 7 look in relief as the Beast is finally destroyed.

After the clasp is released, 1 has meanwhile recoiled into9’s arms. There is a brief moment of awkwardness as 1 and 9

realize how close they are physically to each other.

47.

1 begins to climb up the side of the wing, using dangling 9and 7 as a ladder.

Perched on top of 7’s staff, 1 reaches up for 8, who iscrouched on the edge of the buttress. He grabs 8’s hand,

gesturing imperiously to 8 to pull him up.

9 looks at 7 urgently, nodding to her. She gets itimmediately and grabs 1’s leg, stopping him.

9 looks around and sees the rope tied around 7’s waist.

Your rope.

7 throws it down to 9 who ties it to his own waist. The planetilts... it’s hanging even more precariously now... about tofall out of the side of the Cathedral entirely...

9 suddenly jumps down into the flames just as the planestarts to fall. 7 shouts with stress.

The plane EXPLODES as it hits the ground, smoke rising fromthe crash. The rope pulls taut, and after the smoke settleswe can see 9 dangling with 5 and 6.

They now see, to their horror-

THE SEAMSTRESS:

A hideous SERPENT-LIKE CREATURE with NEEDLE-LIKE CLAWS and a

HORRIFYING VACANT FACELESS HOOD.

The Seamstress has sewed the carcass of "2" into her tail in

order to lure and mesmerize the ragdolls. She emits a

GLOWING LIGHT through 2’s vacant eye sockets.

She RISES UP and points her sewing needles at 1... we see 8’slimp body trapped in her belly.

The other ragdolls leap into action.

7 chops off the tail and with it 2’s carcass but then isthrown to the side and trapped as a cascade of books fall onher.

9 manages to grab 1 who is partially sewn on to theseamstress but can’t free him.

The seamstress lashes out towards them.

She turns to flee, dragging 1 with her. 1 struggles inmortal terror.

seamstress suddenly darts one of her claws out, GRABS 7, andSLITHERS OFF out through the library [ALT: through part of adrainpipe in the bottom of the fountain] with 8 stillattached to her belly and disappears.

They all bow their heads. The twins now slowly send 2floating down the remnants of water in the drainpipe at thebottom of the fountain.

5 pulls out the piece of burlap from 2’s back with his numberon it. He hands it to 9.

We pan down, and see SEEKER DRONES (that the newly vitalizedFabrication Machine has constructed) floating in the airaround the factory, tirelessly looking for enemies. One of

them floats near to camera and its searchlight fixes onsomething. We follow the light down.

The light reveals a PUMPING OIL DERRICK, also newly awakened.

Its pump moves up and down in sinister rhythm.

The light moves away from the derrick. Camera stopsfollowing the light and keeps moving down, arriving at theground where we now see, in the darkness-

THE RAGDOLLS. They huddle behind an oil pipe waiting for theSeeker Drone to pass. 1 is weak, but is supported by 5, whohas been patching him, and is just finishing up, pulling thelast thread out of the patch he’s sewn onto 1. 1 is

regaining his strength. The twins huddle behind 6.

The others nod. 9 turns to 5.

Take charge.

1 scowls. 5 nods, proudly taking the responsibility.
9 darts purposefully towards the factory.

5 looks around keenly, looking up for seeker drones, thenruns out from cover, over to a huge barrel that lies halfburied in the scorched earth. A painting of the Dictator’ssymbol is stenciled on the side.

He taps on the front. It is FULL. He looks up in the air atthe seeker drones. They haven’t seen him.

He gestures to the others.

We see the barrel is on top of a small hill that leads downto coal car tracks. The tracks lead to the open mouth of acoal chute that feeds into the factory.

5 sees a bent spoon on the ground. He smiles, remembering 2and his ingenuity, and picks it up. He hands it to 1.

There is a bright GREEN GLOW as 8’s soul is sucked, and inthe sudden illumination, 9 sees 7. She is sewn into the

Seamstress--but is still alive!

ANGLE on 9 as he realizes she is still alive and he can still

rescue her! From his hiding place he looks around for a wayto rescue her. He inspects the machinery near him. He sees

a LEVER and GEARS. He looks at his LIGHTSTAFF. He then

spots a remnant of the FABRIC used to create the WingedBeast. We see he is formulating a plan. He darts his hand

out to drag the fabric towards him.

ANGLE on the Fabrication Machine as it begins to power backup after taking 8’s soul.

ANGLE on the Seamstress. She turns to get 7, and give her tothe Fabrication Machine. We see the TERROR and DEFIANT FURY

in 7’s eyes, but she is immobilized and can do nothing.

Suddenly the Seamstress hears a SOUND. She whips around.

POV through the Seamstress’s damaged eye: a MOVEMENT in the

shadows.

The Seamstress, distracted from her morbid mission with 7,

slithers towards the movement.

In the shadow we see a RAGDOLL with GLOWING EYES. 7 sees

this and registers recognition, relief, and also TERROR atwhat will be 9’s fate. But she is unable to move or speakand now, just as 9 could only watch 8’s soul being suckedout, 7 can only helplessly watch as the Seamstress slitherscloser and closer to its prey. We see the misery on 7’sface.

The seamstress raises her needles and STRIKES the ragdoll,

sewing wildly.

59.

The ragdoll SWINGS OUT from a string attached to a lever.

The lever now moves down (because of the weight of theragdoll) and SWITCHES on machinery. Gears start to turn and

we see the ragdoll is attached and begins to drag the trappedseamstress in, arms first.

The gears CRUNCH the ragdoll. 7 FLINCHES... but then her

expression turns to amazement as she suddenly sees it is nota ragdoll at all but is 9’S LIGHT-STAFF DRESSED IN FABRIC.

Instinctively, she looks up, a sudden hopeful look on herface... just as

9 SWINGS IN and lands on the SEAMSTRESS, tearing a hole inher back. He slides down the length of her body, FREEING 7.

A scratchy old melody comes from the large Victrolaamplifying horn. 7 smiles at the sound of the music. She

The Fabrication Machine tries to back up on the bridge butends up getting caught in the beams, which form a cage aroundhim. The other ragdolls yell to 6 from the other side of thebridge.

The Fabrication Machine brings 6 up to its eye.

...........................................................

SEQ. 202 - Disagreement

SEQ. 202 - EXT. BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

9 watches in horror as the Machine sucks 6’s soul. As before,

the Machine SHAKES and then seems momentarily paralyzed as itingests the soul. It then re-animates.

1 strides over to 9.

1

We must destroy it.

9 stares at him. We can see a sudden new thought is formingon his face.

9

We can’t.

1 looks at the Machine.

1

Anything can be overcome. One

just needs the right weapon.

9

No. We can’t destroy it.

(to 7)

You heard him:
“Come for us.”

They’re still inside-

7

9, they’re gone.

9

No. I don’t think so. We can getthem back. I just have to figurethis out.

(trying to parse 6’s

words)

“The first room....”

7 tries to persuade 9.

69.

7

We need to get a weapon. Quickly.

9

(trying to parse 6’swords, completely focusedin thought)

“The source... he will show you...”

The machine screams, starting to break free.

1 turns, abruptly, making a decision.

1

This raving will get us nowhere.

I’m going to find a real weapon.

1 turns and stalks off. The twins hesitate, uncertainly.

7 goes over to 9 and implores him.

7

Please. Leave it. Come with us.

9, determined, certain of his path, shakes his head gently.

9

No. I can’t.

7 looks sad, but she feels she has no choice. She ushers the

twins away and they follow 1. The twins are carrying 6’skey.

9 (cont’d)

(muttering)

The source... the First Room...

Suddenly he looks up. He gets it!

9 (cont’d)

The First Room!

SEQ. 210 - Return to the Workshop

70.

SEQ. 210 - INT. ATTIC WORKSHOP - DAY

CLOSE ON THE SHUTTER banging in the Attic Workshop.

9 is staring at it, then looks around the Workshop.

He sees the Scientist on the floor. He recognizes him.

He looks up and climbs up onto the table.

He sees the machine that he fell out of. He sees diagrams.

He sees a journal, with drawings and thoughts. The drawingsinclude: the original machine... the talisman... sketches ofthe dolls... the diagram that we saw in the Librarymanuscript...

He looks further and sees a strip of film. Curiously, hepicks it up, and now sees it’s feeding into a rickety oldmovie projector which now TURNS ON and we see -

THE DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE that we saw being made in the TITLESEQUENCE [It can be the exact same footage, or can beslightly altered if necessary for our uses here; if we stillwant to hear the radio it should be mixed in very low, so weare aware of it but it doesn’t interfere with the scientist’s

dialogue. This is constructed so the scientist can be in

V.O. only until the end, but if possible we can also see the

back of the scientist in the first few pieces of footage].

We HEAR the scientist’s voice and we realize the Scientist

WAS ADDRESSING THE DOLLS.

We see first, THE FOOTAGE OF THE SCIENTIST MAKING 1 and hearthe scientist:

SCIENTIST’S VOICE

(muttering)

It had such promise... my first

creation...

We see, on the table, a drawing of the original machine, asthe Scientist assembles the raw materials of 1. Sounds of

WAR in the b.g.

SCIENTIST’S VOICE (cont’d)

(broken-hearted)

...but it was taken... and bent to

such evil...

We see him making 1.

71.

SCIENTIST’S VOICE (cont’d)

...so little hope remains... thatis why I create you...

The footage crackles out, then RESUMES.

Now we see the FOOTAGE OF THE SCIENTIST MAKING 5.

SCIENTIST’S VOICE (cont’d)

(much more weakly)

I am unable to reverse the transfer

process... my life force diminisheswith each one of you... it is all

right... you will thrive...

Tenderly, he puts 5 together.

The footage crackles out, then RESUMES.

Now we see the footage OF THE SCIENTIST MAKING 9... with

louder, more explosive sounds of WAR in the b.g:

SCIENTIST’S VOICE (cont’d)

...so little hope remains... thatis why I create you...

In the footage we now see him putting 9 into the strangemachine, putting the finishing touches on 9... brushing hishand across the little box...

WE PULL OUT of the footage to see 9, looking in astonishmentat the flickering footage.

9 looks over at the little box in the scientist’s hand in the

footage, and suddenly

FLASH:

9 goes into a startling FLASHBACK:

HIS POV as he is suspended in the strange machine... he sees

the scientist, clutching the little box, from the front asthe scientist approaches him, a look of endless love on hisweakened, haggard face.

SCIENTIST:

(tenderly, to 9 directly)

... it’s up to you now...

(with his last breath of

energy)

...you...you are all the pieces ofmy soul...

72.

The scientist puts the strange face mask on and 9’s POV is

suffused with a GREEN GLOW. The talisman clicks shut, thesoul transfer completed. We hear the scientist fall to the

ground, his soul depleted.

BACK TO PRESENT TIME:

9 comes out of his vision. He looks over the side of the

table at the dead scientist.

9 walks to the scientist and stares at the dead man.

9

(finally realizing it;

gently)

You. You’re the source...

He reaches out to the skeletal hand clutching the box, thensimply touches the Scientist’s hand, tenderly. He looks up,

a new, resolute look in his eyes.

SEQ. 220 - Reunion

SEQ. 220 - EXT. THE WASTELAND - NIGHT

9 runs through the Wasteland looking for the others.

CUT TO:

EXT. THE WASTELAND - NIGHT

9 sees the others through barbed wire. They’re carrying alarge missile towards an old cannon. 9 ducks under and

hurries towards them.
9

He--he’s the source.

They stare at him, uncomprehendingly.

9 (cont’d)

The Scientist! The one who made

the machine. He gave us life too.

They stare at him.

73.

7

How?

9 pauses at the enormity of it. Finally:

9

He... he used his own soul.

7 and the twins look at him in awe and surprise. 1 seems

strangely unmoved.

9 (cont’d)

That’s why the machine is hunting

us. It was warped, reprogrammed tohunt humanity. It, and themachines it made, killedeverything. Except us.

They stare at him.

9 (cont’d)

We’re all that remains.

Suddenly the ground starts to shake. We hear the machine

approaching. 1, 7, and the twins run to the missile.

9 (cont’d)

No! Don’t destroy it!

7

What? It’s hunting us! It’ll

never stop! You said it yourself!

9

No. First we have to get themback.

7

It’s impossible!

She continues loading the missile with 1.

9

It isn’t. I have an idea.

1

Enough of your ideas! We need to

load the weapon!

SEQ. 222 - The machine attacks

74.

SEQ. 222 - EXT. THE WASTELAND - CONTINUOUS

The Fabrication Machine appears from BEHIND THE CANNON. The

ragdolls are CAUGHT OFF GUARD and scramble to get away justas its claw SMASHES down, DEMOLISHING THE CANNON.

The dolls fly back from the blast. 9 is the only onestanding. 9 deliberately walks towards the Machine. 7

rushes over, trying to pull him away.

7

(trying to get back up)

Stop! You’re a fool!

The Machine swipes at 9 with its claw. 7 tries to stop itfrom getting 9. The Machine sends her flying. She lands

badly and can’t get up immediately. The Machine regroups,

then begins to re-approach 9. 9 stays put.

9

(insistently)

It powers down right after it takesa soul! Just for a few seconds.

The twins chatter frantically. 7 struggles to get up.

7

No it doesn’t!

9

Yes, it does. You’ll see. I’ll

let it take my soul. Then

after.... take the device.

He points to the talisman on the machine. He stands as the

Machine approaches.

7

But what if you’re wrong?

(begging him)

Don’t do this-

9

I must.

The Machine raises its claw to grab 9 when suddenly 9 isKNOCKED ASIDE and -

1 TAKES HIS PLACE.

9 (cont’d)

No! What are you doing? Stop!

75.

He tussles with 1 but 1 pushes him aside with surprisingstrength.

1

(to 9)

They left us nothing. Nothing.

What right did they have to burdenus? Why did we have to right theirwrongs? So I refused. I refused

our path. But now... I see... we

cannot refuse it. We are all

that’s left. We must completeour journey.

The Machine raises its claw again and grabs 1.

1 looks over to 9.

1 (cont’d)

Sometimes one must be sacrificed

for the good of many.

With a horrible green glow the machine TAKES HIS SOUL. The

twins look away, distressed.

7

(to 9)

Go! Get away! Hurry!

9

No--no-

But the machine RISES UP TERRIFYINGLY. It looks for a moment

as though 9 was wrong and they’re all going to be killed.

They all cringe with horror.

But then, as 9 had remembered, the Machine powers down to“digest” 1’s soul.

9 darts in and GRABS the TALISMAN.

The machine, with a terrible shrieking sound, falters, thencrumples, dead. Sparks and smoke spew from it. Oil bubbles

down its sides. It is lifeless--just a pile of jumbled

machinery.

7 and the twins approach and all of them look down at theTalisman in 9’s hands and we:

DISSOLVE TO:

76.

...........................................................

SEQ. 240 - Souls Released, Life Renewed

SEQ. 240 - EXT. RUINED CITY, JUST OUTSIDE OF THE SCIENTIST’SHOUSE - NIGHT

Smoke rises from the center of a funeral pyre the dolls havemade.

It is a circular pyre, with spokes reaching out from thecenter.

At the end of each spoke is the burlap skin of one of thefallen ragdolls, with its number stretched across a pole.

In the center, a small FIRE flickers.

9 stands in front of the last pole, holding 5’s skin in hishands. He looks down at it in his hands and sadly places itupon the pole, looking up towards it.

The twins come in with artifacts from the Scientist’s studio.

The journal. The tiny box. They put them down to the side.

9 and 7 take the Talisman and place it IN THE CENTER, infront of the fire.

The Talisman pulsates, vibrates, and shakes, and, finallyBURSTS. A huge GREEN GLOW reaches up to the sky and theragdolls’ souls emerge.

8 emerges and walks to his number. He nods to 9, 7, and thetwins. They nod back, acknowledging the fierce warrior.

2 comes out with 5 close behind. 5 places an arm around 2.

6 emerges from the Talisman energy. He sees his key andcaresses it.

1 emerges and comes over to stand next to 9. He nods,

acknowledging that 9 has finally completed the mission. He

looks up to the sky. The others follow his gaze.

Together, spirits and living, they all watch together, and

watch as the beam shoots up to the sky. We see THE SKY

CHANGING, HEALING, RENEWING ITSELF.

A healing rain begins to fall.

77.

The souls of the slain ragdolls now rise and dissipate into

the healing energy.

9 and 7 watch. 7 puts her arm around 9.

The twins chatter: they’ve taken 6’s key and tried it in the

little box’s keyhole. It opens the box. 7 and 9 go over as

the box is opened:

It is a music box.

As they see themselves reflected in it, they see the word

“HOPE.”

Camera pulls back slowly... revealing a tiny tendril of green

grass growing.

FADE OUT.

THE END:
