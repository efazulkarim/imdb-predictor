It's not my fault, nobody likes him
You know, that's the thing
bad to say
Sorry , Sasha

I'm proud to call you my daughter
Look, I know you and Sasha don't
get along sometimes, but we're family
He is not my brother
Hm, very good
Hey, I almost forgot to show
you guys what I found this morning
Look at this
That's shark teeth, Yes
Is this a white shark? I think
Where did you find it?
find a new road to town
Nice
How sharks get in there , I don't know
Maybe he swam from
the sea chasing seals
They are lost in the tunnel
hundreds of years ago
Very cool , You can keep it
That reminds me of something else
Children, I know I said I would
get together with you this weekend, but
Open this new road means
there will be an archeological team
It's okay dad , Yang will fly
from New York next week,
so I have to finish mapping
the cave, turn on the light
You don't need to explain
But your father is up to something
very special for both of you
What His shark teeth are clues?
Boys, come on, show it to him
Here it is
Glass floor boat trip
to see the white shark
in their natural habitat
Fun for me , No, it's for
tourists , We are indeed some kind of tourist
These kids will impress,
they take you out
The place where the white shark eats
You saw them in the gallery under the ship
Cool , No, I have plans for tomorrow
You have to reset your plan
Also, I think this is a good time to
you spend quality time together , Yes
Where are you going
To tell Alexa me
can't hang out tomorrow
Is that okay
Keep your tone up
Sorry about tomorrow, but
the shark will be very cool
And maybe next week, you
and I can scuba dive
You remember how you like scuba
diving with me , Yes, it's like
when I was 10, father
10 years, the youngest person ever
scuba diving, come on, you're kidding me
And the most beautiful
Yes, you're like a sea monkey
I'll pick you up when going home, okay
Okay

Yes, Mimi, don't eat sharks
Hey, if you sink, us
will come save you
I will save you

I can't believe he's here
What are you doing
here , Come on, we have a plan
I told you, I can't
Bro, I'll take you to a place that is not
any tourist will find in a million years
The opportunity of a lifetime
Or you prefer to sail
on a stupid boat with him , Yes
I mean, stay, stay if you want
Hey, maybe you can

take us spinning and going down
or you can go there
What are you waiting for
This is amazing
I do not know
We have to go the way
Oh wonderful
Fuck the road
That's really cool
Look at all this stuff
Wow
Lots of scuba equipment
This is the equipment your stepfather and Ben prepared
for the archeologist coming next week
Is this the entrance to the city?
If my father finds out, he will kill us
Relax, I've talked to Ben
Your father on the other hand mapped
the path they found
They will never know you're here
This doesn't look like a city to me
This is virtual city
This is built below
land, outside the cemetery
To hide from Kinkisador,
when they invade
Rising sea levels,
make everything under water
Thank you, professor
Did your father ever invite you
dive into the city
Yes once
Like what
That's amazing down there
I mean, we only entered the first cave
It's used as an entrance
Yes
Scary , Yes
Like I said, the underworld
Burial Cave
Yes, it's quite scary.
but that's really cool
They have all ancient statues
and other ancient items
so what are we waiting for
Come on, this is just the first cave
But my father , He is miles away
Yes, they have different entrances , Look
All that we need
I mean, there are no fins, so , Come on,

and we don't see the temple
Really , It's not like ever
You saw before, we have to
in and out after the first cave , Yes
When was the last time you dived
Many years ago
I used to go with dad, but
never in a cave before
Like riding a bicycle, right , Come on Mia
Yes, he will do it
Come on Mia!

Just remember to keep your movements slow
The last thing you want to do,

The sharks evolved to become blind,
they have sensitive hearing
Must be the frequency
Maybe we can use it
alarm to keep them away
I mean someone will look for us
when we don't come back tonight, right
Nobody knows we're here
I just found my way into
This cave, only I know this place
And there is no way we can go back
go up without the down tool
What we will do
We have to go back down,
there is no other way
What , Listen, this cave is connected to the sea
If we follow, we
will appear in the ocean
There will be strong currents down there
will try to suck us down
So we must stay together
If you stay here, you will die
We will take care of each other
And we can survive this
Okay, kids, I believe in you guys
Watch out!
Where are they
I do not see it
What we will do
We will do what he says
We will go back down
I can not
I can't , We have to,
