Excess Baggage By Max D. Adams 
Page 1/96
EXT. PORTLAND, OREGON (ESTABLISHING) - DAY 
Portland, home of rivers, bridges, and more parks than youcan shake a stick at. The Columbia River, spanned by the Highway 5 and 205bridges, glistens a muddy brown in the sunlight; the Willamette glittersoff to the South. INT. PARKING GARAGE/UPPER LEVEL - DAY 
EMILY ROSE T. HOPE cut her teeth on a million dollar teethingring, and it was bitter -- too bitter. It left her an old woman's attitudein a young woman's body. 
She idly taps a cellular phone's keypad with one perfectlymanicured nail as she stares through the parking level's open struts ata distant bridge -- and an approaching river barge. 
The barge draws closer to the bridge. Closer. Closer still.She takes a drag off a cigarette, stubs it out, and dials a number on thephone's keypad. EXT. BRIDGE - DAY 
AMADEUS T. HOPE, an older man who most assuredly broke histeeth on a Rolls Royce, stands in a phone booth just off the bridge, waitingfor the phone to ring and caressing a briefcase like it contained a milliondollars -- which it does. Nearby, idle joggers in the park are more thanobviously undercover cops. The phone rings and Amadeus lifts it. 
AMADEUS: 
I'm here. 
EMILY (V.O./FILTERED) 
Amadeus T. Hope? 
AMADEUS: 
Yes. 
EMILY (V.O./FILTERED) 
Did you bring the money. 
AMADEUS: 
Yes. 
EMILY (V.O./FILTERED) 
Listen carefully. 
AMADEUS: 
I wish to speak to my daughter. 
EMILY (V.O./FILTERED) 
I'm not interested in what you wish, Mr. Hope. Justfollow directions and stick to the plan. Am I clear? 
AMADEUS: 
Very. 
INT. PARKING GARAGE/UPPER LEVEL - DAY 
Page 2/96
Emily watches the barge move towards the bridge and readjustsher speaking apparatus -- it's a voice filter and it's a real bitch talkingthrough this rig. 
EMILY: 
Do you see the barge approaching the bridge? 
INT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY 
Amadeus squints through glass booth walls, notes the approachingbarge, nods. 
AMADEUS: 
I see it. 
EMILY (V.O./FILTERED) 
Walk to the bridge, throw the briefcase onto thebarge, and come back to the phone booth for further directions. 
AMADEUS: 
How do I know you'll release her? 
EMILY (V.O./FILTERED) 
You don't. 
INT. DETECTIVE VAN - DAY 
DETECTIVE DAN SIMS is the kind of guy who does his job well,but everything always goes to hell anyway. This gives him a grim take onlife, but he keeps trying. He watches a fellow COP fiddle with telephonetracing equipment. Sims' less than garrulous partner, BARNABY, listens inon an extra set of headphones. 
COP: 
Shit. Cellular phone. 
SIMS: 
What did you expect? A silver platter? 
COP: 
Would'a been nice. 
Sims stares out the van's polarized window at Amadeus, who'swalking steadily out along the bridge. 
SIMS: 
It's probably hers -- where's he going? 
BARNABY: 
To throw the money over the side. 
Page 3/96

SIMS: 
What? 
BARNABY: 
That's what they just told him to do. 
Sims, glaring, grabs for a walkie talkie. 
SIMS: 
Were you going to tell me before or after he tossedit? 
Barnaby shrugs. 
SIMS (CONT'D) 
(into walkie talkie) 
He's throwing the money onto the barge. I want fullsurveillance -- don't lose that barge -- 
INT. PARKING GARAGE/UPPER LEVEL - DAY 
Emily's got the phone balanced precariously on one shoulderas she flips open the trunk of a gray Mercedes Benz and extracts some heavyduty tape. She stands again to stare out at the distant bridge. 
Amadeus, stick figure tiny with distance, heaves his briefcaseover the side and starts back to his phone booth at a steady pace. 
EMILY: 
Nice throw, Dad. 
Joggers (i.e. under cover cops), looking like ants fromhere, scramble to keep pace with the barge. Emily laughs softly as she tapesher ankles together. 
The phone crackles to life. 
AMADEUS (V.O.) 
You've got the money. Where's my daughter? 
Ankles taped, Emily hops to the edge of the trunk to rummagefor more bondage paraphernalia and holds the voice filter carefully in placewhile she speaks: 
EMILY: 
You'll find her in the trunk of her car, which isin fifth level parking at -- 
She pulls a wrinkled slip of paper from her jeans pocketand squints at it -- 
EMILY (CONT'D) 
352 East Tenth Street. 
She hangs up and, working fast now, because time is runningout, gags herself -- a real gag: stuffing, knots, the works. 
Lifting hand cuffs -- the final touch -- she crawls intothe car's trunk Page 4/96

and, still clutching the handcuffs -- presumably for lateruse -- slams the lid closed from the inside. 
The ECHO of the slamming trunk reverberates through thedim garage, and dies. 
EXT. BRIDGE - DAY 
Judging from the number of plain cars screaming out of parkingspaces, it's a good bet they got that address. 
INT. DETECTIVE VAN - DAY 
Sims comes out of the van at a dead run, talking into awalkie talkie, as undercover cars peel out, SIRENS wailing on as they go. 
SIMS: 
Odds are someone's still inside monitoring -- 
He glances at the distant parking structure. 
SIMS (CONT'D) 
They can still see us from there, turn off the goddamn sirens! INT. PARKING GARAGE/UPPER LEVEL - DAY 
The Mercedes sits innocently in its parking slot. Silence-- except for the slap slap slap of approaching footsteps, and a light,airy tune being whistled by the person approaching. 
WILL POGUE ambles nonchalantly between cars, well dressedyuppie at large, just picking up his car and heading home -- or that's whatyou'd think, until he saunters to the Mercedes, casually glances both ways,and a slim jim flashes in the gloom. 
He's inside the car, yanking the ignition and starting themotor, between whistles. 
EXT. RIVER BARGE - DAY 
B.g., a helicopter drones. The barge MATE steps out of thewheelhouse, notices the briefcase on the aft deck, frowns, walks to it,picks it up, shakes it, opens it -- and ogles a million bucks, cash. 
MATE: 
Holy shit! 
He spins back to the wheelhouse -- a plea for help. 
MATE (CONT'D) 
Larry! Larry! You gotta come see this! 
The PILOT (let's take a wild guess and assume this is Larry)sticks his head out the wheelhouse cabin's door -- just as a helicopterzooms down and a SHARP SHOOTER aims a high powered rifle straight at themate. A HELICOPTER COP leans out with a megaphone. 
HELICOPTER COP (MEGAPHONED) 
This is the Portland Police Department. You withthe briefcase, set it down and put your hands on your head. 
Page 5/96
MATE: 
What the -- ? 
HELICOPTER COP (MEGAPHONED) 
You in the cockpit, pull over immediately. 
The mate drops the briefcase and money starts flutteringall the hell over. INT. POLICE HELICOPTER - DAY 
The sharp shooter smirks at the helicopter cop in a superiorway -- 
SHARP SHOOTER: 
It's not a car, John, it's a boat. You don't pullover -- 
-- when he sees the money take wind -- 
SHARP SHOOTER (CONT'D) 
-- Oh shit, the money! 
The helicopter cop pales -- still yelling through the megaphone-- HELICOPTER COP (MEGAPHONED) 
-- Oh fuck, the money. You! Pick the briefcase backup! 
Below, the mate wants nothing more to do with that briefcaseand has gotten down on his knees to say a few Hail Marys. 
HELICOPTER COP (CONT'D) (MEGAPHONED) 
You with your hands over your head, pick that briefcaseup immediately! EXT. RIVER BARGE - DAY 
The pilot abandons the wheelhouse to try to stop the money'spell mell trail into the sky -- 
He stops dead when the sharp shooter brings the rifle tobear on him -- going after the money is threatening behavior -- 
The helicopter cop is still yelling through his megaphone-- HELICOPTER COP (MEGAPHONED) 
Pick up that briefcase! You moron! Pick it up! 
The mate is staring up at the helicopter, eyes big, shakinghis head back and forth -- no way is he touching that brief case -- 
The barge, minus its pilot, hits bottom, the jolt spinningthe briefcase out along the deck -- 
INT. UNDERCOVER CAR - DAY 
Dan Sims wrestles his seat belt, struggling to snap it intoa mechanism that just doesn't want to work, riding shot gun as the undercovercar careens around the corner and down the street toward the parking structure-- EXT. PARKING GARAGE - DAY 
The gray Mercedes slips out the structure's exit -- as 
miscellaneousundercover cars careen past it on their way in -- and turns down the streettowards Sims' car. 
INT. UNDERCOVER CAR - DAY 
Dan, cursing his seat belt, glances up in time to see theMercedes pass, does a double take and turns to read the license plate -- 
Page 6/96
SIMS: 
Holy shit, that's her car! 
Barnaby, at the wheel, speeds along in the opposite direction. 
BARNABY: 
What? 
Sims, still clutching his seat belt, grabs for the sirenas they hit a bump, drops the siren, grabs it again. 
BARNABY (CONT'D) 
I thought you said no sirens. 
SIMS: 
Turn around! That's her god damned car! 
INT. MERCEDES - DAY 
Will, whistling casually, hears tires squeal behind himand checks the rear view mirror -- in time to see Sims slap the SIREN atopthe undercover car. 
WILL: 
Holy shit! 
Will steps on it, sliding between two more unmarked carsthat screech around corners to cut him off -- he cranks the wheel and avoidsa third -- Will drives better than well -- but he's sweating, cursingunder his breath, fighting to outdistance cop cars converging behind him,to dodge incoming cars that keep adding up -- 
WILL (CONT'D) 
Jesus Christ, all this for a lousy grand theft auto? 
EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY 
Life is not looking good here. Money scattered all overthe ground, all over the water, the barge pilot and mate shaking in theirshoes, the barge grounded in mud at an awkward angle -- and glum undercovercops milling to and fro. The helicopter cop talks into a radio mike. 
HELICOPTER COP: 
Dan, we lost the money. 
INT. UNDERCOVER CAR - DAY 
Dan Sims, rocking around each curve, hangs onto his swingingseat belt for dear life and yells into his radio. 
SIMS: 
What do you mean, you lost the money? It's on abarge! How hard could it be to keep track of a barge? 
HELICOPTER COP (V.O.) 
We didn't lose the barge. We lost the money. 
Page 7/96

SIMS: 
For Christ's sake, where'd it go? 
INT. RIVER BANK - DAY 
The helicopter cop stares glumly up at all those flutteringbills in the sky. . . down at all those floating bills on the water. . .. 
HELICOPTER COP: 
Half is air borne, and the other half sank. 
INT. UNDERCOVER CAR - DAY 
Dan's about three shades of purple, still clinging to hisdysfunctional seat belt, yelling into the radio -- 
SIMS: 
Well fish it out! -- 
When the car slows. Dan rounds on Barnaby, the driver. 
SIMS (CONT'D) 
What are you slowing down for! 
BARNABY: 
We lost him. 
Sims looks up from the radio at the abandoned street. 
SIMS: 
God damn it, where are the helicopters. 
BARNABY: 
They lost him too. 
Sims slumps. 
SIMS: 
I don't believe this. 
Barnaby shrugs. 
BARNABY: 
He can't have gone far. They'll pick him up. 
INT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE - DAY 
The warehouse is large, immaculate, and dark -- ground levelwindows are painted black and barred. Shelves hold engine parts. An oldbeat up Porsche Speedster sits in a corner. Loft steps lead to living quartersabove. An electric garage door slides open, triggering a ceilinglight, and Emily's Mercedes glides in. The garage door shuts behind it andWill climbs from the car to run a shaky hand through his hair. 
B.g., a helicopter DRONES. He lets out an explosion of breath,frowning at Page 8/96

the ceiling, WILLing the copter away. 
WILL: 
Jesus. 
He pats the car. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
Who'd you belong to, sweetheart? The president orwhat? 
He checks the car, inside and out, admiring the interior,checking underneath the chassis. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
Last job, and I nab the president's car. It figures. 
He pops the trunk -- there's Emily, bound and gagged, lookingthe worse for the ride, glaring up at him -- it might have been a mistake,her cuffing her arms behind her back. 
WILL: 
Jesus Christ! 
He slams the trunk. 
Muffled POUNDING inside. He opens the trunk cautiously,to stare incredulously at Emily. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
Who the hell are you? 
EMILY (MUFFLED) 
Mmmmphmmmphmmmphmmmph! 
WILL: 
I don't need this. 
He lowers the trunk lid and scrubs his face with a wearyhand. EMILY (MUFFLED) (O.S.) 
MmmmMmmmph-ph-ph! 
He raises the trunk lid. 
WILL: 
Can you breathe? 
EMILY (MUFFLED) 
MMmmmmmmMMMphmmmmm! 
He nods. 
WILL: 
Have you had water within the last twenty-four hours? 
EMILY: 
MphMphMph! 
Page 9/96
WILL: 
You look healthy to me. 
He slams the lid, jumps into the driver's seat, and hitsthe control for the garage door. 
WILL: 
Sweating, revving the engine, waiting for clearance underthe door -- 
WILL: 
It's okay. She doesn't know your name. She doesn'tknow the address. Nobody saw you come in. We're just going to leavethe car somewhere for the cops to find. No. She could die by then.Okay, we'll call the cops -- an anonymous tip. No problem. Finda corner. Dump the car. Stay calm. Everything is all right -- 
As the garage door opens, the helicopter DRONE fills thewarehouse. Will sits, listening to that drone in the sky, tapping thesteering wheel -- he turns off the engine and listens a second longer, beforeclosing the garage door against that sound. 
WILL: 
Shit. 
INT. AMADEUS's STUDY - EVENING 
An ad for the house would boast five fireplaces, parkingfor nine cars, two hundred feet of river frontage, a dock. . . we are talkingexceptionally expensive -- and frighteningly neat. 
THOMAS PERKINS steps into the study: Thomas has scars toprove he's been bad places and lived to not talk about them, whichconflicts with his million dollar suit only insofar as he wears it well. 
Amadeus, intently manicuring what looks like a perfectlymanicured Bonsai, nods. 
AMADEUS: 
Someone's kidnapped Emily. 
Perkins snorts. Amadeus pinches off a microscopic sectionof tree, discarding it in an empty waste basket. 
AMADEUS: 
The police -- 
(Amadeus uses the word "police" much theway a bull dyke says "penis") 
PERKINS: 
You called the police. 
Page 10/96
AMADEUS: 
No. They called the police. 
PERKINS: 
They. 
AMADEUS: 
Yes. 
PERKINS: 
Well she's got your attention now, hasn't she? 
Amadeus shoots him a dour glance. 
AMADEUS: 
I fail to see the humor in the situation, Thomas.There's a precedent at stake here. 
Thomas snorts again -- no way is he believing this. 
AMADEUS (CONT'D) 
The police informed me a man drove her car awayfrom the pick-up zone. Thomas frowns -- less sure of himself. 
PERKINS: 
An accomplice? That doesn't sound like Emily. 
A peremptory KNOCK and Dan Sims pushes into the study. Thomasturns, giving Sims a view of the back of his head and not much else. 
SIMS: 
Mr. Hope, I'd love to answer phones in your foyerall day, but this man -- Sims glowers at Thomas's back. 
SIMS (CONT'D) 
-- is not on my roster of household staff -- orguests. 
AMADEUS: 
Mr. Perkins is a private associate, Detective Sims.He'll be taking over. 
SIMS: 
Excuse me? 
AMADEUS: 
Your services are no longer necessary, DetectiveSims. If you WILL excuse us? 
Amadeus drops another nothing into the waste basket -- amove not lost on Sims. 
Page 11/96
SIMS: 
We are not a cleaning service, Mr. Hope. We arethe police. Amadeus stares blankly, like "what's the difference?" 
PERKINS: 
I think what Detective Sims is trying to say, Amadeus,is you can't fire the police. 
SIMS: 
Exactly. 
AMADEUS: 
(to Perkins) 
Are you sure about this? 
Perkins nods solemnly. 
AMADEUS (CONT'D) 
Very well, Detective Sims may maintain surveillance. 
Sims chokes. 
SIMS: 
I. May. 
AMADEUS: 
(to Sims) 
That will be all, Detective Sims. 
Sims stands his ground, mutely refusing dismissal. 
AMADEUS (CONT'D) 
Unless you'd like to discuss the money. 
SIMS: 
I'll be in the foyer. 
Sims spins for the door -- the door handle fights him. 
AMADEUS: 
Turn to the right, Detective Sims. 
Sims, crimson, turns to the right. 
AMADEUS (CONT'D) 
And Detective Sims? If you're going to remain afixture in this household, speak to my assistant -- he'll cut youa wardrobe check. 
The door slams behind Sims. 
AMADEUS (CONT'D) 
Nobody holds me hostage. 
Perkins stares into a glass case -- one of those pedestaljobs you find museum displays in, but this holds photographs: 
Page 12/96
Emily at three; Emily at the military academy; Emily atgraduation; Emily at a high powered reception beside her father -- ThomasPerkins loves that little girl. 
PERKINS: 
We'll make that clear. 
INT. AMADEUS'S ANTEROOM/OFF THE STUDY - EVENING 
Wires run from phones to phones to black boxes -- presumablythe latest in police tech surveillance -- monitored by bleary eyed COPS. Amadeus's ASSISTANT attempts to work around the squad roomsqualor. Barnaby, being a calm soul, doesn't jump when Sims slamsin. 
SIMS: 
Mr. Hope just fired us. 
Shocked silence from the cops -- sounds perfectly reasonableto Hope's assistant, though. 
HOPE'S ASSISTANT 
You'll be leaving, then. 
Dan stares at the assistant, incredulous. 
SIMS: 
No we won't be leaving! 
COP: 
Can he do that? 
SIMS: 
No he can't do that! 
BARNABY: 
(aside to the cop) 
We're the police, Corey. 
COP: 
Oh, right. 
SIMS: 
Let's get this straight. We are the police. Andwe are in control here. 
ASSISTANT: 
Not on this planet. 
INT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE - EVENING 
The Porsche is gone. The Mercedes sits in the gloom. 
INT. MERCEDES/TRUNK - EVENING 
Page 13/96

Emily is in a minor fix -- and judging from the sweat anddiscontent factor, has been for some time. It's not easy to pass arms, handcuffedbehind you, under your legs to in front of you -- especially when you'relying on your side in a trunk -- and Emily's stuck mid-way. 
She struggles again to get her hands past her feet. Strugglessome more. They come free. 
Next job is to wrench the gag away -- she tied a good gag,so it's tough going, but she gets it off. She yanks stuffing from her mouth,takes a big breath -- spits, tries to wet her mouth. 
EMILY: 
Thank God. 
Smiling grimly at success, she extracts the handcuff keyfrom her front jeans pocket and releases the cuffs. 
EMILY (CONT'D) 
Can you breathe. What an asshole. 
EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT 
Will's old Porsche glides down a dimly illuminated street. INT. WILL'S PORSCHE (WAREHOUSE DISTRICT) - NIGHT 
Will's checking the neighborhood for signs of stress, andwhat he sees isn't good. On the corner, a cruiser. 
WILL: 
Cop. 
Across the street, another cruiser. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
Cop. 
Overhead, a helicopter. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
Cop. 
On the sidewalk, a German Shepherd -- 
WILL (CONT'D) 
Cop -- dog? 
He shakes his head. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
Don't be paranoid. That is not a cop dog. 
He cranes his neck to stare up through the windshield. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
But that is definitely a cop helicopter. 
He eyes the passing cruiser. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
And that is definitely a cop car. 
Another cruiser sits quietly on the corner, lights out,but there's a guy in Page 14/96

uniform in the car all right. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
Cop cop cop. 
Will jerks the steering wheel hard, swerving down a darkstreet and away -- INT. MERCEDES/TRUNK - EVENING 
Emily searches around the trunk lid's key slot -- frustrated,not finding what she wants, then finding it -- a small hole in the metal-- There's a piece of metal blocking the mechanism that wouldusually allow someone to open the trunk from the inside. 
EMILY: 
Why does it always have to be the hard way? 
She squirms around to face the back of the trunk -- 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. MILITARY SCHOOL - DAY (FLASHBACK) 
Impeccable grounds, impeccable buildings -- except for one,the corner of which has been reduced to rubble by an explosion, if the burnmarks are any indication. 
Thomas Perkins, hands clasped behind his back, rolls forwardand backward on the balls of his feet, studying the rubble. 
Emily (young) stands beside him, dressed "academy," suitcaseby her feet, and grins, proud. 
PERKINS: 
You're lucky no one was in there. 
Emily's offended. 
YOUNG EMILY: 
That wasn't luck. I called. 
PERKINS: 
Voice I.D. 
Emily grimaces chagrin. 
YOUNG EMILY: 
That won't happen again. 
Thomas lifts her suitcase and strides across impeccablelawn, towards a faraway and expensive automobile with tinted windows. 
PERKINS: 
You won't call? Awful messy, when bodies blow. 
She stumps along at his side. 
Page 15/96

YOUNG EMILY: 
I won't use a cold phone. 
PERKINS: 
Emily, if we could keep you in school long enoughto get an education, you'd have a real future in Secret Service. 
They're at the car. He opens the passenger door for her.She pulls out a cigarette and lights up. 
YOUNG EMILY: 
I don't need a future. I'm rich. 
Thomas plucks the cigarette from her mouth, grinds it underhis heel, and extends his open palm, waiting. 
She glares, sighs, and hands over the pack. 
INT. PERKINS' DISCREET AUTOMOBILE - DAY (FLASHBACK CONT'D) Thomas drives. Young Emily broods in injured silence. 
YOUNG EMILY: 
He could have come. Probably playing with thosedamn trees. 
PERKINS: 
Maybe he doesn't appreciate paying for a new wing. 
Injured silence. 
PERKINS (CONT'D) 
You know what this means. 
YOUNG EMILY: 
Uh oh. 
PERKINS: 
Back to Catholic school. 
YOUNG EMILY: 
Nuns? Again? 
PERKINS: 
It's going to take a while for me to get you inanywhere else. 
YOUNG EMILY: 
Nuns are the worst. 
PERKINS: 
Look in the glove box. 
Emily brightens and digs, coming up with a gift wrappedbox. Page 16/96

PERKINS (CONT'D) 
Happy Birthday, Emily. 
Emily shoots him a grateful smile, reads the card, grimaces. 
YOUNG EMILY: 
Thank you, Uncle Thomas. 
PERKINS: 
It's from your father. 
YOUNG EMILY: 
It's a nice lie. Thanks for remembering. 
She tears wrapping. 
PERKINS: 
You're locked in a room. What do you do? 
YOUNG EMILY: 
Check windows. 
PERKINS: 
The windows are barred. 
YOUNG EMILY: 
Check doors. 
PERKINS: 
The doors are locked. 
YOUNG EMILY: 
Check the ceiling. 
This is a very old routine, almost sing song. 
PERKINS: 
Ceiling's clean. 
Emily lifts a delicate necklace from the wrapping. 
YOUNG EMILY: 
This is beautiful, Uncle Thomas. 
She leans over, kisses his cheek. 
YOUNG EMILY (CONT'D) 
Thank you. 
PERKINS: 
Page 17/96

Ceiling. 
YOUNG EMILY: 
I don't want to play today. 
Silence. 
YOUNG EMILY (CONT'D) 
Why don't you take me out to dinner, Uncle Thomas? 
Silence. 
YOUNG EMILY (CONT'D) 
It's my birthday. 
More silence. Emily sighs. 
YOUNG EMILY (CONT'D) 
I hate rooms. Let's do explosives. 
He cocks an eyebrow at her -- explosives are not a goodsubject right now. 
PERKINS: 
We're doing rooms. 
YOUNG EMILY: 
Okay, rooms, but you have to buy me a realdrink. 
He snorts laughter. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE - EVENING 
The Mercedes' back seat pops loose and Emily, scuffed, crawlsfrom the trunk, over the back seat, into the car's interior. 
EMILY: 
You owe me a drink, Thomas. 
The first thing she reaches for is the Mercedes' cellularphone. The cord is cut. 
EMILY (CONT'D) 
Oh, you creep. 
She pulls her purse from the trunk, rearranges the backseat, and considers a cigarette -- sniffs the air, wrinkles her nose, shakesher head sorrowfully, and puts the cigarette away -- before climbing outof the car to survey her surroundings. No phones. 
INT. WILL'S PORSCHE - NIGHT 
Will steers down a dark street he knows by heart -- takesan alley by rote, a short cut, passes a sign: "Portland International Airport"-- EXT. PORTLAND INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT 
The Porsche idles, headlights illuminating Will as he shovesaside a fence marked "Airport Personnel Only" -- 
He pulls the car into an abandoned lot off the runway, settlesonto the Page 18/96

car's hood with a weary sigh, stress falling away as he staresup at planes taking off for Somewhere Else. 
And watching his face, you know he wants to be going toSomewhere Else -- has wanted that for all his life -- 
INT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE - EVENING 
Whoever designed this place was more than security conscious.Bars and locks on what few windows there are, each requiring a key. Emilystrokes the bars in disgust, shoves a finger through to scratch a thin linein the black paint covering the glass surface. 
EMILY (CONT'D) 
Shit. 
There're a couple of doors on the ground floor. First one'sa bathroom. She checks it out. Nothing in there but toilet paper, toilet,sink, and soap. The second door is locked. 
She pads upstairs to study the door to the living quarters-- also locked. Not with a household doorknob. With a key lock. 
EMILY (CONT'D) 
What a control freak. 
She turns to study the garage door. No buttons for gettingthis baby open -- ceiling and door mechanisms out of reach. Everything lockeddown, barred, keyed, bolted. 
She pads to a tool bench and rummages in its drawers --the only things not locked down. 
EXT. PORTLAND INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT 
Will's still watching those planes -- but he's calmer, moretogether, and it's time to shake it off. 
Moving stiffly, he climbs off the hood, walks around toclimb into the porsche's driver's seat. 
INT. WILL'S PORSCHE (PORTLAND INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT) - NIGHT Starting the engine, shooting one more "Wait for me, I'mcoming back" grimace at those rumbling planes. 
WILL: 
Another day. Another life. 
He pulls out and away. 
INT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE - NIGHT 
Emily, surrounded by tools, works to disassemble the lockon the living quarters door -- this is one killer lock. 
The tool slips, stabs into her finger -- adding to a growingassortment of insults to what used to be a perfect manicure -- she popsthe injured digit into her mouth, studies the nicks, cuts, and abrasionswith contempt. A police SIREN flares outside. 
She brightens, till the siren FADES into the distance. 
Page 19/96
EMILY: 
To protect and serve. Yeah, right. 
She rises stiffly, shoves sweaty hair off her forehead,glares angrily at the lock -- which looks intact as hell -- stretches, sighs,and pads to the bathroom. 
EXT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE - NIGHT 
The Porsche glides to the warehouse's garage door. 
INT. WILL'S PORSCHE - NIGHT 
Will triggers the garage door with the opener that neverleaves his side -- preferably, as high tech a coded mechanism as God puton this green earth, when it comes to garage door openers. The door slidesopen. INT./EXT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE/BATHROOM/MAIN WAREHOUSE - NIGHT Emily's on the toilet when the electric garage door HUMS,b.g. 
EMILY: 
No! 
It's hard to hurry these things up, but she's ready to peeher jeans to get out of there -- she reaches automatically to flush thetoilet, jerks her hand back. 
EMILY (CONT'D) 
What, am I nuts? 
Struggling to get her pants put to rights as she stumblesto the door -- 
MAIN WAREHOUSE: 
Will guides the Porsche into the slot beside the Mercedes,swings out of the Porsche, approaching the Mercedes, as the garage doorstarts down, pauses -- He doesn't want to open that damn trunk. He eyes it, apprehensive-- 
WILL: 
This is ridiculous. 
He pops the trunk. 
It's empty. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
Oh shit. 
He stares around the warehouse -- nothing -- spins to eyethe closing garage door in horror. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
No! 
He smacks the control, halting the door in mid-close, ducksunder it to stare up and down the street of a run down warehouse district. Emily slips from the bathroom, working her way stealthilyalong the wall towards the open door. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
God damn it! 
Page 20/96
An OLD WOMAN stops picking through a dumpster to glare defiantlyat him. He rakes a hand through his hair -- 
Emily's almost to the open door -- 
Will turns, ducking back inside -- looking both ways -- 
Emily, busted, lunges for the opening -- 
He lunges to cut her off -- 
It's a flying, freewheeling tackle -- they hit the concretefloor -- inside -- and hard. 
POV: 
Outside the door, the old woman gawks. 
WILL and emily 
Will's fighting to hold Emily down as he clicks the garagedoor opener -- the door starts going up -- 
WILL: 
Damn it! 
Clicking again -- going down -- 
Fighting -- it's not a sure thing who's winning here --she kicks the door's bottom edge -- going up -- 
He's cursing, hitting buttons -- going down -- 
She's kicking -- there's a lot of defense training in thosekicks -- which is unfortunate for Will's jaw -- going for the door againwith that foot -- He heaves, dragging them both backwards across concrete,out of reach -- and the door slams closed. 
Silence. 
Will rolls onto his toes, breathing heavy, waiting for thenext attack. Emily stares at the closed door in disgust, rubs her concreteburned elbow. 
WILL: 
If you were smart, you would have pulled that stuntwhen I pulled in. 
EMILY: 
I am smart. I had to pee. 
Not what he was expecting -- and he almost laughs, stopswhen he touches his injured chin. 
Wincing -- that elbow hurts -- she studies him. 
EMILY (CONT'D) 
This place is harder to get out of than a convent. 
WILL: 
How'd you get out of the trunk? 
She surveys the Mercedes, the warehouse, him. 
Page 21/96
EMILY: 
You're not a kidnapper. You're a thief. 
Will snorts. 
WILL: 
And the handcuffs. 
EMILY: 
Hah. You were after the car. 
WILL: 
Lady, you're giving me a headache. Who are you? 
She smiles, all winsome charm. 
EMILY: 
Tell you what. Give me the car keys, let me outof here, and this'll be our little secret? Deal? 
INT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE - NIGHT (LATER) 
Emily sits on the commode, handcuffed again, this time tothe sink. She's wearing pants this time, too, but that doesn't appear tocheer her up. Will, flaunting a new and improved jaw injury, smiles grimlyand pockets the handcuff key. 
EMILY: 
You scum sucking, arrogant, peg-headed, sadistic-- 
Will touches his jaw gingerly. 
WILL: 
I liked you better in the trunk. 
EMILY: 
I hope you go bald. 
A doorbell CHIMES above in the living quarters. 
WILL: 
Oh, hell. 
He shuts the bathroom door -- on a few stifled yells --and punches an intercom button on the wall. 
WILL: 
Yeah? 
JOE (V.O.) 
Will? 
Page 22/96
WILL: 
Joe? 
JOE (V.O.) 
Yep. 
Will winces. 
WILL: 
What are you doing here, Joe? 
JOE (V.O.) 
Plates ring a bell? Maybe tags? Maybe you were supposedto be at my place five hours ago? 
WILL: 
Oh. Great. 
(he doesn't sound great) 
Hang on -- I'll be right up. 
EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT 
The old woman from the dumpster stalks, stiff backed, toa parked police cruiser and raps on the window. A startled PATROLMAN rollsit down. She stares him straight in the eye, daring him to notice her dirtswept hair. 
OLD WOMAN: 
I would like to report a case of domestic violence. 
PATROLMAN: 
You need to call it in. I'm on special assignment. 
OLD WOMAN: 
Excuse me, while I pull out my portable phone. 
PATROLMAN: 
You want a ride downtown, Sister? 
OLD WOMAN: 
There is a man beating his wife down the street. 
The patrolman winces. She radiates indignation. He liftshis radio. 
PATROLMAN: 
Central, I've got a report of domestic violencein the neighborhood. Request backup. Over. 
VOICE OVER: 
Negative, 223. All cars in the vicinity on specialassignment. I'll have to send someone else out. Over. 
Page 23/96
The patrolman rolls his eyes at the old woman. 
PATROLMAN: 
(to old woman) 
What'd I tell you? 
She snorts. 
PATROLMAN (CONT'D) 
(into radio) 
Central, there is a man beating his wife down thestreet. Over. A pause. 
RADIO (V.O.) 
Sit tight, 223. I'll see what I can do. 
INT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE/APARTMENT - NIGHT 
(Uncle) JOE POGUE is a pretty good indication of what Will'sgoing to grow up to be, if Will doesn't get on one of those planes prettyquick. Not that Joe's a bad guy -- he isn't -- but he's got a habit, namelya bottle, and a tired stoop to his shoulders that says bad news has perchedon his doorstep one too many times. 
Will opens the door, ready to say something appropriate,like maybe this is a bad time -- but doesn't get the chance. 
JOE: 
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. Where have you been? 
Joe barges right in, waving a crinkled up brown paper shoppingbag under Will's nose -- about the size and shape of license plates. 
WILL: 
Oh god, I forgot. 
JOE: 
You forgot? You forgot? I thought you were in jail. 
Stalking to the refrigerator. 
JOE (CONT'D) 
He forgot. You got anything to drink around here? 
The question's moot, as Joe's got his beer and is headedfor the door to downstairs. 
JOE (CONT'D) 
Did you get her? 
Will panics for a quick second. 
WILL: 
Her? 
JOE: 
Page 24/96
The car? 
WILL: 
Oh, right, the car. Yeah, I got her. 
Joe, much to Will's chagrin, is headed straight for thedoor to downstairs. 
JOE: 
Well let's take a look. 
Joe stops at the door, studying the knob, which is loose. JOE (CONT'D) 
When are you going to quit this business, Will? 
Will, at a loss, shrugs. Joe snorts and studies the warehouseside of the doorknob and lock. Scratched. 
JOE (CONT'D) 
Yeah, that's what I thought. Last job, my ass. 
Joe stomps down the steps. 
JOE (CONT'D) 
He forgot. 
INT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE - NIGHT 
Joe, stroking the Mercedes, whistles. Will attempts to arrangehis hands in some sort of natural pose and look nonchalant. 
JOE: 
She's pretty. 
WILL: 
I don't think I can unload her. 
Joe's head snaps up. 
JOE: 
Why? What's wrong with her? 
WILL: 
Long story. 
JOE: 
Then it'll have to wait -- 
Joe smacks the bag and beer into Will's numb hands. 
JOE (CONT'D) 
There're your papers, tags, and plates -- whetheror not you can unload her -- and there's my beer. I gotta talk toa man about a horse. Joe's on his way, steamrolling right up to that bathroomdoor. 
WILL: 
Page 25/96
Uncle Joe? 
Joe's hand's on the doorknob, turning -- 
JOE: 
Yeah? 
The door's opening -- 
WILL: 
Nothing. 
Emily, sitting on the commode, shoots Joe one wide, fake,frosty smile, and waves at him with her free hand. 
JOE: 
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph! 
Joe simultaneously leaps up, backward, and slams the door.He stands, hand on knob, thinking for a moment, before turning heavily tothe stairs and starting back up for the living quarters. 
INT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE/APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Joe's sitting at the table, stone cold still. Will's fillinga coffee pot with water, just as quiet. 
JOE: 
Get me another beer, Son. 
Will gets the beer, pops it open, sets it down beside Joe'sempty. Joe drains it, then sets the can carefully down on the table. JOE (CONT'D) 
Pardon me for intruding in your affairs, Will, butthere is a girl downstairs chained to the commode. 
Will nods, pouring water into the coffee maker. 
JOE (CONT'D) 
Of course, it's nice to see you with a girl, Will.I've been kinda worried about you in the girl department of late. 
Will ogles Joe, mouths "In the girl department?" -- coffeesplatters from the coffee machine -- Will jams the pot in place to catchthe stream. JOE (CONT'D) 
But it was somewhat of a surprise. 
WILL: 
I can see that. 
JOE: 
I think I'll be heading home now, Will. 
Joe stands and heads creakily for the door. 
Page 26/96
WILL: 
Uncle Joe, would you like to know why I have a girlchained up downstairs? Joe thinks a moment, slowly shakes his head. 
JOE: 
Nope. Nope. Don't want to know nothing about it. 
He's at the front door, opening it, turning. 
JOE (CONT'D) 
But Will? 
WILL: 
Yes? 
JOE: 
Flowers are a good alternative. 
Joe closes the door behind him. Will sits at the table,trying to take it all in. The door opens again and Joe sticks his head in. JOE (CONT'D) 
Oh, and Will? 
WILL: 
Yes? 
JOE: 
She's a real pretty girl, Will. Your parents would'vebeen proud to know you're seeing such a real pretty girl. 
And then he's gone. Will rises slowly and starts closingdown locks -- all keyed from the inside. There's a window running alongsidethe door -- barred, natch, but you can see through the upstairs windows,'cause they aren't painted black. 
INT. POLICE CAR (BEHIND WILL'S WAREHOUSE) - NIGHT 
The patrolman eyes back entrances to warehouse buildings.They all look pretty much the same in the gloom. The old woman leans forwardand points. 
OLD WOMAN: 
That's the one. 
PATROLMAN: 
You sure? 
She nods. 
OLD WOMAN: 
Across from the dumpster. 
Page 27/96
PATROLMAN: 
Okay. 
Through the patrol car's back window, you can see a secondpatrol car following them as he glides down the back street and turns thecorner. EXT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE/FRONT - NIGHT 
Joe's climbing into his old Chevy -- a small, slumped figurein all that darkness -- when the two police cars cruise around the cornerand down the street towards the warehouse's front entrance. 
WILL (O.S.) 
Oh, shit. 
The police cars are slowing, checking buildings -- 
WILL (O.S.) (CONT'D) 
Go, Uncle Joe, Go. 
INT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE/APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Will's at the window, every tendon in his body pushing forJoe to get out of there -- 
WILL: 
Don't stop, old man. 
EXT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE/FRONT - NIGHT 
Joe's leaning forward in his car, eyeing the approachingcruisers in his rearview mirror -- casually, oh so casually, adjusting thatmirror -- you can see the indecision in him, sitting there, adjusting themirror just a little too long -- 
But he starts his old car up and pulls away from the curb,gliding slowly down the block -- 
INT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE/APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Will, standing pensive by the window, watching -- 
WILL: 
Keep going, Joe, keep going -- 
EXT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE/FRONT - NIGHT 
Joe's Chevy glides around the corner as the two cruisershalt in front. Their doors creak open, and the patrolman and a COMPANIONCOP climb out. INT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE/APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Will drags a pre-packed duffel bag from under the bed, checksto make sure a stack (we are talking a serious STACK) of money is in there,and hoists the duffel, heading for the stairs. 
A KNOCK sounds behind him. 
Another KNOCK. 
He sets the bag softly down and eyes the door. 
WILL: 
Okay, they're serious. But how serious? 
Page 28/96
EXT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE/FRONT - NIGHT 
The patrolman knocks on the door again, looks at his COMPANIONCOP, shrugs. 
COMPANION COP: 
Lights are on. 
The patrolman nods, starting back for his car. 
PATROLMAN: 
Call it in and see what they say. 
He leans into the cruiser, pulls out the radio mike. 
PATROLMAN (CONT'D) 
Central, I've got a situation here in the warehousedistrict. Over. INT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE/APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Will hoists his duffel bag. 
WILL: 
Too damn serious for me. 
INT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE - NIGHT 
Will, coming down stairs two at a time, tossing the duffelbag into the back of the Porsche, yanking the bathroom door open on Emily-- 
EMILY: 
You running a peek show here or what? 
WILL: 
Up. 
He's undoing the handcuff on the sink, jerking her to herfeet, dragging her towards the car -- 
EMILY: 
Who was that old man? 
Shoving her headfirst through the Porsche's passenger door,he slaps the cuff to the passenger brace bar -- 
EMILY (CONT'D) 
Hey! God Damn It! 
She jerks backwards -- stuck. 
WILL: 
Get in. 
She doesn't. 
He's headed around the car, slipping into the driver's seat,revving the engine as he slaps control keys to open the garage door -- hepauses to stare at her, hard and cold. 
Page 29/96
WILL (CONT'D) 
You can ride inside or outside the car, but eitherway, when that door opens, we're leaving. 
Emily climbs into the car and slams the door. 
EMILY: 
You're a real fun date, you know that? 
WILL: 
You aren't my idea of a good time. 
The Porsche squeals out of the warehouse. 
INT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE/APARTMENT - NIGHT 
The coffee pot steams on its burner. 
EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT 
Joe slows to a crawl, pulls the Chevy over, and sits thereidling -- tapping the steering wheel, indecisive. 
JOE: 
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. 
He squints at approaching headlights in the rearview mirror. The approaching car slows, pulls alongside him. Natch, it'sa COP. The cop shines a flashlight in at Joe, rolls down a window, forcingJoe to roll down his window and squint into the glare. 
COP: 
Everything all right here? 
JOE: 
Oh, yeah, just fine. I just kinda lost my way. 
The cop's getting out. Joe winces. 
COP: 
Could I see some identification, please? 
JOE: 
Oh, sure. 
Joe fumbles for his wallet, pulls out a license, extendsit with a shaky hand -- the cop eyes him, takes it, studies it, then Joe. 
COP: 
Mr. Pogue, would you please step out of the car? 
JOE: 
Excuse me? 
Page 30/96

COP: 
Please step out of the car, Sir. 
Joe opens the door and climbs out. 
JOE: 
Hey, I just got a little lost, is all. If you couldgive me directions to the freeway -- 
COP: 
Have you been drinking tonight, Mr. Pogue? 
INT. WILL'S PORSCHE - NIGHT 
Will winds up Highway 5, North. Emily, still cuffed to thebrace bar, broods in the passenger seat. 
EMILY: 
I can see you are a master economist of words. 
Will grunts, spots a lone gas station and phone booth onan abandoned stretch, slows to pull off the highway. 
EMILY (CONT'D) 
You're a kidnapper now, you know. I mean, before,it was just an accident, but this is definitely a hostage situation. 
Silence. 
EMILY (CONT'D) 
Oh, and in case you didn't notice that sign backthere? "Washington." Silence. She shakes her head in mock chagrin. 
EMILY (CONT'D) 
Crossing a state line with a hostage. That's a federaloffense. Will idles in front of the phone booth, unlocks the cuffs,leans across her to push open the passenger door. 
WILL: 
Get out. 
Emily eyes him, the phone booth, him. 
EMILY: 
Get. Out? 
The car idles. Cold wind sweeps through the open door, rufflinganything not nailed down. 
She sits, not moving. Comprehension dawns on his face. 
WILL: 
Oh. Here. 
He fishes in his pocket, pulls out a quarter, smacks itinto her palm. Page 31/96

She studies the quarter in her palm like it's some sortof alien relic -- slowly looks up at him. 
EMILY: 
Are you mad? 
WILL: 
Excuse me? 
EMILY: 
You think, after being locked up, starved, bullied!Brow beaten! Robbed! And you forgot my purse. You think now you'regoing to give me a quarter and leave me here? 
WILL: 
This'll do. 
EMILY: 
Forget it. I want a cigarette. I want breakfast.I want a shower. And I want my car. 
She crosses her arms. He struggles for an appropriate response-- 
WILL: 
I don't allow smoking in my car. 
EMILY: 
Are you for real? 
The engine idles. 
Will eyes the car's dimensions, gauging the feasibilityof a fight in close quarters, touches the bandage on his chin. 
She smiles, smug -- his odds don't look good. 
WILL: 
I'm a hardened criminal. 
EMILY (CONT'D) 
I'm Emily Rose T. Hope. And you do not want to messwith me before I get my morning cigarette. 
Emily snaps her seat belt on with finality. 
INT. UNDERCOVER CAR - NIGHT 
Dan Sims wrestles his seat belt as the undercover car screechesthrough the warehouse district. 
SIMS: 
I thought I told you to get this fixed. 
Page 32/96
Barnaby shrugs. 
BARNABY: 
I did get it fixed. 
SIMS: 
Then why isn't it fixed? 
BARNABY: 
New car assignment. 
Dan, at a loss, studies the car's interior -- it sure ashell looks like the same car, right down to the gum on the dashboard. Hesighs. 
SIMS: 
Get it fixed. 
Barnaby shrugs. 
SIMS (CONT'D) 
What the hell is that? 
Dan squints through the windshield at a column of blacksmoke. 
BARNABY: 
Looks like smoke. 
SIMS: 
I am really trying to like you, Barnaby, but youjust make it so damn hard. Barnaby shrugs. The car speeds on -- 
SIMS (CONT'D) 
Oh no. It can't be. . . . 
But it is. Will Pogue's warehouse roars away in a fire tobeat all fires. Out front, police and firemen jostle shoulder to shoulderwith newscasters. EXT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE - NIGHT 
Sims climbs from the car to stare in appalled silence atthe blaze. Barnaby climbs from the car to stand cheerfully at his side. 
BARNABY: 
Fire started in the kitchen. 
SIMS: 
You knew about this? 
BARNABY: 
Car's inside, though, so this is definitely theplace. 
SIMS: 
Page 33/96
How do you know this? 
Barnaby shrugs. 
BARNABY: 
Daniels called it in. Too bad they couldn't getthose locks off, before the building went. Gonna lose a lot of evidence. 
SIMS: 
Barnaby. 
BARNABY: 
Yes? 
SIMS: 
I'm not sure there's a legal precedent for arrestingmy partner for withholding evidence, but I am going to check thebooks. 
B.g., Perkins watches the blaze, watches Sims and Barnaby,taking it all in with an impassive expression. A REPORTER slams a microphoneinto Sims' face. 
REPORTER: 
Detective, is it true this is the suspected lairof kidnappers? 
SIMS: 
What? 
REPORTER: 
Isn't it true, Detective, that -- 
INT. WILL'S PORSCHE - DAY (OVERCAST) 
Dawn streaks the sky. Will drives down a dirt road, ominouslysilent. Emily sucks on a cigarette, blows smoke out the open window, studyingthe deserted surroundings warily. 
EMILY: 
A speech class could do wonders for you. Maybe instillsome of that inner confidence needed to carry on a conversation. 
He keeps driving -- we're talking past the middle of nowhere,here -- the landscape grows more and more barren. 
EMILY (CONT'D) 
Want to tell me where we're going? 
No response. Emily is winding tighter and tighter. 
EMILY (CONT'D) 
Nice place to hide a body. 
Not even a peep. 
She stubs out her cigarette, glares at the open window. 
Page 34/96
EMILY (CONT'D) 
How can anyone live without air conditioning? 
He turns into an abandoned field. 
She rolls up her window, surreptitiously glides her fingeracross the door lock -- pushes it down. 
He stops the car, shuts off the ignition, turns to rummagein the duffel bag. 
She slams him hard with her elbow, hits him again to keephim down, lunges across him to knock his door open -- 
He's coming up -- she kicks him, sending him backwards outthe door -- kicks again, to send him all the way out -- 
Will hits dirt as she slams the door, locks it, slides intothe driver's seat, and reaches for the ignition -- 
No key. 
Will, rising stiffly, jingles the car keys outside the windowand smiles, grim. 
She punches the ignition switch -- 
WILL: 
Open the door. 
She punches the ignition switch again. It pops free. Shereaches for its wires. 
Will winces -- he did not want to do this -- doubles uphis fist, and punches a hole through the driver's side window. 
Emily lunges backwards, out of reach, into the passengerseat, still holding the limp ignition. 
He unlocks and opens the driver's side door. 
WILL: 
What the hell do you think you're doing? 
Emily is breathing hard, tensed to kick him again. 
Seconds tick by. She relaxes -- barely. 
EMILY: 
What are you doing? 
Will reaches cautiously into the car to lift a running shoefrom the floorboard -- what he dropped when the assault began -- danglesit for her inspection. 
Emily, pale, eyes it, him. 
He looks pointedly at the driver's seat, raises a brow ina question. She bites her lip, nods, gathering herself into a smallball as he sits gingerly on the glass littered driver's seat and pulls offhis shoes. 
WILL: 
Page 35/96
It's six o'clock. 
This means nothing to Emily. Lacing up, he shoots her askeptical glance. WILL (CONT'D) 
I run at six o'clock. 
She bites her lip harder. Will lifts the limp ignition andstudies it, her, pops the hood and climbs out. 
EMILY: 
Now what are you doing? 
He jerks the distributor cap and pockets it, before limpingdown the road at a slow lope. 
Emily watches him go in consternation. 
EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY 
Will, bloody but unbent, doggedly runs, ignoring Emily,who trots by his side, puffing a cigarette. 
EMILY: 
You're angry. 
Silence. 
EMILY (CONT'D) 
Well what did you expect me to think? 
Silence. 
EMILY (CONT'D) 
I'm sorry. 
He shoots her an appalled glance. 
WILL: 
For beating the crap out of me, or my car? 
Emily smiles, winsome charm. 
EMILY: 
How can I make it up to you? 
WILL: 
Go home. 
EMILY: 
I'd love to do that for you, but then I'd have toexplain about how you stole my car. 
WILL: 
I'll buy it. 
EMILY: 
Page 36/96
Excuse me? 
WILL: 
I'll buy the damn car. 
EMILY: 
But I love that car. 
He seethes. 
EMILY (CONT'D) 
Fifty thousand dollars. 
WILL: 
What? 
A slow drizzle is beginning. Will, breathing hard, stopsand braces his hands against his knees. Emily looks him up and down, takesa pull off her cigarette. 
EMILY: 
For a runner, you're not in very good shape. 
WILL: 
Fifty thousand dollars. It's used. 
EMILY: 
Cash. 
His jaw tightens. 
WILL: 
Fine. 
Will picks up the pace. Emily, fascinated, follows. 
EMILY: 
You've got fifty thousand dollars cash? 
WILL: 
Yes. 
EMILY: 
On you? 
WILL: 
Yes. 
EMILY:

INT. MOTEL/ROOM - DAY 
Emily hums, toweling her hair. Will taps the phone, impatientas hell. Emily grins. 
EMILY: 
You oughta take one. Nice to be human again. 
WILL: 
What's the number? 
EMILY: 
What, no breakfast? 
Judging from his expression, it looks like breakfast isout. 
WILL: 
The number. 
EMILY: 
Where's my money? 
Will throws a packet of cash on the table. 
EMILY: 
Five-oh-three, five-five-five, eight-nine-seven-six. 
WILL: 
Thank you. 
He dials. It RINGS on the other end. Emily lifts cash andcounts under her breath. 
ASSISTANT (V.O.) 
Hope residence. 
Will extends the phone to Emily. She shrugs him off, stillcounting. ASSISTANT (V.O.) (CONT'D)

You are going to talk to him. 
EMILY: 
Forty seven, forty eight -- 
AMADEUS (V.O.) 
This is Amadeus T. Hope. To whom am I speaking? 
WILL: 
Your daughter would like to speak to you, Mr. Hope. 
Will extends the phone to Emily. She takes her time. Willshakes the phone at her. She touches off the last bills. 
EMILY: 
Forty-nine, and fifty. 
She smiles sweetly and takes the phone. 
EMILY: 
(into phone) 
Daddy? 
AMADEUS (V.O.) 
Emily? 
EMILY: 
Daddy, he made me suck his penis -- 
WILL: 
What!? 
Will rips the phone away and slams the receiver into itscradle. Emily collapses on the bed, laughing. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
What the hell is the matter with you? You thinkthat's funny? He rips the money from her hands. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
Give me that! 
She's still laughing. He ogles her, horrified. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
Page 39/96
You look human. . . you sound human. . . but underneathit all -- Emily stops laughing. 
EMILY: 
We'd better leave. 
WILL: 
You leave. 
EMILY: 
They traced that call. 
Emily heads for the door. Will's not going anywhere. 
WILL: 
They didn't have time. 
She pauses, exasperated. 
EMILY: 
My father doesn't need time. We've got to go. Now. 
He stands firm. She stalks out. 
WILL: 
Shit. This is definitely a hostage situation. 
INT. WILL'S PORSCHE - DAY (RAINING) 
Will, driving, squints against rain splattering throughthe hole in the driver's side window. Emily, smoking with her window cracked,is quiet. 
WILL: 
Family reunions must be a blast at your house. 
She taps cigarette ash out the window -- wind and rain blowit back into the car. Will winces. 
EMILY: 
I'm just having a little fun here. Don't take itpersonally. 
WILL: 
This is fun? 
EMILY: 
This car isn't safe anymore. 
WILL: 
You want another car, you steal your own. 
Page 40/96
EMILY: 
Excuse me. I have a car. It happens to be in yourgarage. They drive in stony silence -- 
WILL: 
Lemme let you in on a little secret, Princess. Thecars I steal are business. Not fun. Not boredom. Not rich kid curiosityor life on the wild side. Business. 
He's pissed. Emily laughs. 
EMILY: 
I like you. 
WILL: 
What do you do to people you don't like? 
Will sighs, swerves to the curb, turns to her, engine idling. WILL (CONT'D) 
Look, I don't like being chased by police. I don'tlike police coming to my door. I don't like strangers in my house.I don't like strangers in my car. I don't like strangers, period. 
Emily studies him with a clear steady gaze. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
So I'm sure you're a real nice girl, though you'vegot a few problems and a real strange sense of humor, but I didn'task for you, I don't want you, I don't need you, and I don't likeyou. I want off this ride. 
EMILY: 
Okay. 
WILL: 
Okay? 
EMILY: 
Okay. 
WILL: 
Good. 
EMILY: 
Pay me for my car, and I'm gone. 
WILL: 
What? 
Page 41/96
Emily shoots him a look. His jaw tightens. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
Fine. 
EXT. MOTEL - DAY 
Thomas Perkins' discreet automobile -- tinted windows, Oregonplates -- sits in the motel parking lot Emily and Will just left -- 
And past the car, through the motel office window, you cansee Perkins conversing with a very pale motel office clerk -- who opensa registration book, no questions asked, for Thomas to examine. 
EXT. TRUCK STOP - DAY (RAINING) 
It's not night, but it's damn dark, what with rain and clouds.A gaudy neon light flashes welcome at the interstate. Fluorescents piercethe gloom above gas pumps and semis. Occasional burly figures dash beneathslickers for the yellow glow of a coffee shop. 
Will and Emily stand in shadow by the Porsche. Will castsa doubtful glance around -- Emily extends her hand. 
EMILY: 
Well, have a good life. 
Will awkwardly accepts the handshake. 
WILL: 
Same to you. 
EMILY: 
And lose that car -- 
Will opens his mouth to protest -- 
EMILY (CONT'D) 
Just for a while. Park it somewhere. And stay awayfrom phones. Trust me on this. 
She strides away, a slim, erect figure in the gloom -- looking,suddenly, awfully frail and abandoned. Will frowns, a hint of concern, thentouches his bruised jaw and eyes his broken window. 
WILL: 
Who am I kidding? She can take care of herself. 
He shakes his head -- Emily turns -- 
EMILY: 
Hey, what's your name? 
Will pauses, indecisive -- 
Emily (CONT'D) 
Never mind. Probably better if I don't know. 
Page 42/96
WILL: 
Right. 
EMILY: 
Right. 
He watches, until she disappears around a corner -- 
INT. WILL'S PORSCHE - DAY (RAINING) 
Will collapses into the Porsche's rain soaked seat, grimacesat the wet and the hanging ignition, then starts the car and pulls ontothe highway. But he checks the rearview mirror one last time, watching thetruck stop lights fade away into the gloom. 
WILL: 
Good-bye, Emily Hope. 
And he breathes a sigh of relief. 
EXT. FARMHOUSE/DRIVE - DAY (RAINING) 
Dusk is falling as Will's Porsche turns up a dirt driveand halts at an old gate -- 
Will climbs out to unlock a rusty key lock on an old chain,swings the gate open, drives through, climbs out to relock it, before continuingup the drive. 
INT. WILL'S PORSCHE - DAY (RAINING) 
Will follows the drive through trees, an overgrown field,around a bend -- there's an old dilapidated farmhouse and a boarded up barnahead. He stops at the barn and clicks his trusty garage door opener-- the barn door rolls back on tracks. 
INT. BARN - DAY (RAINING) 
Inside, the barn's similar to Will's Portland warehouse:illuminated by overhead flourescents, a clean, if dusty, cement floor, acouple cars under dusty covers. 
Will climbs wearily from the Porsche, pats its side affectionately,and heads out the side door -- 
EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY (RAINING) 
-- making his way to the old farmhouse -- 
INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY 
A big old place, dusty and unused. But the utilities work-- Will swings into the kitchen, flicks on lights, dials a phone -- pauses,shakes his head -- 
WILL: 
Don't be ridiculous. 
And continues dialing. He drags a coffee maker from underthe counter, rinses as he listens to the phone RING on the other end. 
JOE (V.O.) 
Page 43/96
This is Joe. I'm not here. Leave a message. 
Will sighs. 
INT. TRUCK STOP/COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT 
Emily, rain soaked and looking less than able to pay fora cup of coffee, sits at the counter wearing a pair of large, black sunglasses,sipping the aforementioned coffee and studying a map. 
The WAITRESS shoots her a suspicious glance, ambles up torefill her cup and smack a bill on the counter. 
WAITRESS: 
Lotta glare on the road today, is there? 
She indicates the rain swept night outside the windows.Emily touches her sunglasses and laughs, self conscious. 
EMILY: 
Oh, these. 
The waitress waits for Emily to take off the sunglasses.Emily doesn't. EMILY (CONT'D) 
This is very embarrassing -- 
Emily touches a finger to the skin beneath her sunglasses-- implying a black eye -- shrugs, lifts her coffee cup, bringing her scabbedover elbow into full view -- 
In two seconds flat, the waitress goes from smart ass tosympathetic. 
WAITRESS: 
Do you need help? 
Emily casts her gaze around the room, smiles wryly. 
EMILY: 
Do you know any of these people? I hate to justask a stranger, and I guess they have rules about people ridingalong, but. . . Do you know anyone, a nice guy maybe, who wouldbe willing to give someone a lift out of town? 
WAITRESS: 
Where do you want to go? 
Emily 
It doesn't matter where, it just needs to be tonight. 
WAITRESS: 
You just sit right here, honey, i'll be right back. 
The waitress stiff legs it to a table and whispers to truckers. INT. FARMHOUSE/BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Will revels under a hot shower. 
EXT. FARMHOUSE/DRIVE - NIGHT 
Page 44/96
The gate to the drive hangs open. 
A car approaches -- a very expensive car with tinted windowsand Oregon plates -- headlights off, it parks out of sight of the farmhouse. 
You guessed it: 
INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT 
Scrubbed and dressed in a robe, Will pours himself a cupof coffee, ambles into the spartan living room, switches a radio on to MUSIC,lifts a phone, dials, and listens to it RING on the other end as he liftsa remote control and switches on the MUTED TV. 
JOE (V.O.) 
This is Joe. I'm not here. Leave a message. 
Will frowns, hangs up, and relaxes into a chair to stareat the TV. Boring. He flips channels -- 
Jerks forward in his chair, and switches back a channelto stare in horror at -- 
The TV screen shows an anchorman, the warehouse fire, acharred Mercedes, more fire -- 
Will's jaw drops. 
WILL: 
Oh shit. 
Will's high school yearbook photo flashes by, a pictureof Emily -- 
WILL: 
Shit shit shit. 
PERKINS (O.S.) 
Interesting viewing? 
WILL: 
Jesus! 
Will spins to stare at Thomas Perkins, who steps silentlyinto the room. WILL (CONT'D) 
Who the fuck are you? 
PERKINS: 
I'm Uncle Tom. Who the fuck are you? 
Perkins holds up photocopies of mortgage deeds, studiesone in mock annoyance. 
PERKINS: 
William Pogue, who owns a warehouse in Portland,Oregon -- Studying another photocopy -- 
Page 45/96
PERKINS (CONT'D) 
-- William Danny, who owns a farm in Denton*, Washington?,or maybe William Baker, who owns another warehouse -- you like warehouses,don't you? -- in Seattle, Washington. 
Perkins lowers the papers. 
PERKINS (CONT'D) 
I'll just call you William. Now, William, where'sEmily Hope? Perkins brings out a gun and casually begins screwing asilencer into place. EXT. TRUCK STOP - NIGHT (RAINING) 
Standing beside a rumbling semi truck, the waitress embracesEmily and shoves a bag into her hands. 
WAITRESS: 
There's food in here, to hold you over. 
EMILY: 
Thank you Norma. 
WAITRESS: 
Don't even think twice about it. You just get yourselfsomewhere safe. Emily gives her a hug, shoves bills into her big waitresspockets, and swings up into the truck cab. 
WAITRESS: 
Now blast you, I told you -- 
EMILY: 
You take that money, Norma. It's all I've got togive you, and money isn't enough. 
Emily slams the cab door, waves, and the semi rumbles outof the parking lot. 
INT. TRUCK STOP - NIGHT 
Norma, the waitress, is wiping down a deserted counter,when Will, face cut up and a bit wild around the eyes, stalks up -- wearinga really nice suit. 
WAITRESS: 
Coffee, Hon? 
WILL: 
I'm looking for a girl. 
Norma looks Will up and down, not liking what she sees. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
She may have come in here. About yeah high, suchand such hair, thin, kinda delicate looking? 
Page 46/96
WAITRESS: 
She's gone. 
Will sighs in relief. 
WILL: 
You've seen her. Do you know where she went? 
WAITRESS: 
Somewhere you can't get your lousy hands on her,is where. Don't let the door hit your ass on the way out. 
WILL: 
What? 
WAITRESS: 
Bobby? Joe? 
The place is not entirely deserted -- two very burly TRUCKERSglance up from their booth. 
TRUCKER #1 
Norma, you need something? 
WAITRESS: 
This gentleman is looking for the little girl Mikegave a ride to -- She indicates Will with her chin -- 
TRUCKER #2 
That so? 
The truckers are rising -- rising being an understatement-- to approach Will. 
TRUCKER #1 
He the one gave her that black eye? 
Norma's got her hands on her hips, staring Will down. 
WILL: 
Now wait a minute -- 
TRUCKER #2 
I think maybe we need to have a talk outside, Son. 
INT. SEMI TRUCK CAB - DAY (MORNING) 
Emily wakes up, ensconced in the bed of the truck cab, asMIKE the trucker climbs into the cab with two styrofoam cups of coffee. 
MIKE: 
Morning. Want some coffee? 
Page 47/96
EMILY: 
Thanks. 
He hands it back to her and she cracks its cover to happilybreathe in steam, before taking a sip. 
MIKE: 
Your eye looks pretty good. 
Thomas Perkins' tinted windows car pulls into the lot outside. 
EMILY: 
I'm a fast healer. 
She sets the cup down and crawls to the front of the cab,to get a better look -- it is definitely Thomas's car. She sucks in breath.Mike frowns at the car. 
MIKE: 
Someone you know? 
She nods, tired, and drags on her shoes. 
Mike's glowering at the car. 
MIKE: 
You don't have to go out there. 
Emily gives him a tired smile and a kiss on the cheek. 
EMILY: 
Thanks for the ride and the coffee, Mike. I'll beokay. 
She drops down out of the cab. Mike shakes his head. 
MIKE: 
Why do they always go back, I wonder? Nice prettygirl, could have anyone she wanted, and she goes back to the blackeye patrol. 
EXT. TRUCK STOP #2 - DAY (MORNING) 
Emily braces her shoulders and walks towards Thomas's car. 
EMILY: 
Aw, well, it was a fun ride, Em. 
She sighs, and opens the passenger door. 
Will glares at her from the driver's seat. 
EMILY (CONT'D) 
You! 
WILL: 
Get in. 
Page 48/96

EMILY: 
Fuck you. You burned my car! 
She whirls and stalks back towards the truck. 
WILL: 
I what!? 
He slams out and stands there, breathing hard. She turns,glaring. 
EMILY: 
No wonder you were in such a hurry to get out ofthere. You torched the place! 
WILL: 
The hell I did. More likely one of your relativescame to visit. She stares at the car, his suit -- 
EMILY: 
Where's Thomas? 
WILL: 
In the last twenty-four hours, I've been beatenup by three people, threatened with a gun, insulted by a waitress,and I had to run naked through the woods. So I'm not in the moodto hold this conversation in the god damned rain. Now get in thecar. 
EMILY: 
You ran naked through the woods? 
She glances at her watch: five thirty. 
EMILY: 
Wow. It's not even six o'clock. 
INT. PERKINS' DISCREET AUTOMOBILE - DAY (RAINING) 
Emily smokes like a fiend. Will drives by reflex. 
EMILY: 
I'm not going back. 
WILL: 
The hell you aren't. 
EMILY: 
You wouldn't be in this mess, if you hadn't gonearound making a bunch of phone calls. 
The car's cellular phone rings. Will stares at it, appalled.Emily eyes it, Page 49/96

curious. 
WILL: 
Don't answer that. 
EMILY: 
Who is it? 
Silence. Will's jaw works. 
EMILY: 
Uncle Tom? Uncle Tom is calling you on the phone? 
She laughs, delighted. He glares. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
If I'd known the fucking marines were on my ass-- but no. It wasn't the marines. It was Uncle Tom, a much morefrightening individual. Where the hell did you think you were yougoing? 
EMILY: 
Fort Lewis. 
WILL: 
Oh, that explains everything. 
EMILY: 
If you must know, I was going to visit a priest. 
Will snorts. 
WILL: 
Well now you're going to visit a policeman. Whothe hell is Uncle Tom? Emily stares around the car in fascination. 
EMILY: 
I can't believe you stole Uncle Thomas's car. Andhis clothes. How did you do it? 
WILL: 
I ran. 
EMILY: 
You outran Uncle Tom? 
WILL: 
He wasn't counting on me jumping through that plateglass window. She reaches up to touch one of his facial nicks. 
Page 50/96
EMILY: 
But how -- 
Will shoots her a deprecating glance, grits his teeth -- 
WILL: 
The clothes were in the car. 
He's waiting for an explanation, seething. She sighs. 
EMILY: 
He's not really my uncle, that's just what I callhim. 
He rubs his eyes, tired to death of subterfuge. She sighs. EMILY (CONT'D) 
Uncle Tom does clean up for my father. 
WILL: 
He's a janitor. Why didn't I think of that. 
Will jerks the steering wheel, straightening the car's pathout on the road. 
EMILY: 
When's the last time you got some sleep? 
He grits his teeth. 
EMILY (CONT'D) 
Jesus, I bet you haven't slept at all. You can'teven stay on the road. 
WILL: 
I can stay on the road. 
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY (RAINING) 
Perkins' car screeches off the road -- slamming to a haltamid flying pebbles and mud. 
WILL (O.S.) 
Uncle Tom is a hit man? 
INT. PERKINS' DISCREET AUTOMOBILE - DAY (RAINING) 
Will stares, horrified, at Emily. 
EMILY: 
Not exactly. 
WILL: 
Then I wish to hell you'd tell me what "exactly"Uncle Tom is. 
EMILY: 
Okay, he's a hit man. 
Page 51/96
Will plunges off the shoulder, through weeds and mud, ontothe feeder road. EMILY (CONT'D) 
Where are you going? 
WILL: 
I have to make a call. 
INT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY (RAINING) 
Will listens grimly to Joe's answering machine. 
JOE (V.O.) 
This is Joe. I'm not here. Leave a message. 
Will hangs up. 
WILL: 
Jesus, Joe, where are you? 
INT. JAIL CELL - DAY (MORNING) 
Uncle Joe stands at the common phone, amidst the glamourand glitz of a holding cell. 
VOICE OVER: 
I'm sorry, but the number you have dialed is disconnectedor no longer in service at this time. If you feel you have reachedthis recording in error -- 
Joe drops the phone into its cradle. 
JOE: 
Damn. Looks like I'm walking. 
A gnarled VISITOR laughs. 
VISITOR: 
Joe, you miser, why don't you cough up for a cab? 
JOE: 
Already had to pay the damn fine. 
A GUARD clangs the cell door. 
GUARD: 
This ain't a hotel, you know, Pogue. You going orstaying? 
JOE: 
I'm going. Hold your britches. 
Joe shambles out. 
VISITOR: 
Page 52/96
Damn idiot's going to walk. Crazy assed white sonof a bitch. INT. AMADEUS'S VIEWING ROOM - DAY 
It truly is a viewing room, in every sense of the word.Amadeus sits in a massive chair, watching a newscaster harass Dan Sims onthe enormous TV screen. 
NEWSCASTER (V.O.) 
Is it true Emily Hope, daughter of billionaire AmadeusT. Hope the Third, has been missing for three days? 
SIMS (V.O.) 
No comment. 
NEWSCASTER (V.O.) 
Is it true the recent grounding of a river bargewas a failed attempt -- Amadeus snaps off the telecast, stares at the dark screen.Thomas rises silently and refills their drinks. 
AMADEUS: 
Do you relize how embarrassing it is to call a bankpresident and tell him you need one million dollars replaced? 
Thomas drops ice in the drinks. 
AMADEUS (CONT'D) 
Do you realize there are eleven news vans parkedoutside this residence? Thomas hands Amadeus a drink. Amadeus sips, brooding. 
AMADEUS (CONT'D) 
Privacy, Thomas, is a rare commodity. 
PERKINS: 
Amadeus, it's Emily. 
AMADEUS: 
That's no longer an issue. Someone must take publicresponsibility for this fiasco -- that someone will not be a Hope.She's in Washington? Perkins nods. Amadeus shakes his head. 
AMADEUS (CONT'D) 
Please tell me we aren't involving the Bureau inthis. 
PERKINS: 
It's unconfirmed. It will remain unconfirmed. 
AMADEUS: 
Is there any way we can -- 
Amadeus gestures helplessly at the TV. 
PERKINS: 
Short of killing everyone in the news departments? 
Page 53/96
Amadeus considers the possibilities -- 
PERKINS (CONT'D) 
No. 
Amadeus sighs, strokes one of his Bonsai. 
AMADEUS: 
They're so perfect. So controlled. 
Perkins' face twitches. 
PERKINS: 
Will you permit me to make an observation, Amadeus? 
AMADEUS: 
Certainly, Thomas. 
PERKINS: 
Emily is not a plant. 
Amadeus frowns. 
PERKINS (CONT'D) 
Just an observation. 
Amadeus turns the tree to a more complimentary angle. 
AMADEUS: 
I'm experiencing the strangest emotions, Thomas.Relief. And shame. Because I thought my daughter was dead -- 
He strokes the moss at the plant's base. 
AMADEUS (CONT'D) 
-- and the thought was oddly comforting. I supposethat makes me a terrible person. 
Perkins doesn't say a word. Amadeus sighs. 
AMADEUS (CONT'D) 
I don't care how you do it. Shut the circus down. 
Thomas nods and heads for the door, leaving -- Thomas turnsto the right. AMADEUS (CONT'D) 
Thomas? 
Thomas pauses. 
AMADEUS (CONT'D) 
My father was rarely present, while I was growingup, yet I didn't terrorize every living soul I came in contact with. 
Thomas's eyes are sad in that hard masked face of his. 
PERKINS: 
I'm not judging you, Amadeus. 
Page 54/96
AMADEUS: 
Aren't you? 
PERKINS: 
No. Just making an observation. 
And Thomas is gone, leaving Amadeus alone in that big, beautiful,perfectly controlled, and very empty room. 
INT. JOE'S AUTO PARTS - DAY (RAINING) 
If you want to talk grease and engine parts, "Joe's AutoParts" is sacred, if grimy, ground. The phone is RINGING. Uncle Joe, lookingthe worse for his visit with the authorities, not to mention his walk, appearsoutside the window and unlocks the shop door. The answering machine clickson. JOE (V.O.) 
This is Joe. I'm not here. Leave a message. 
The door JANGLES as Joe pushes in. The machine beeps. Hestumps across the room to pick up, just as the caller hangs up. 
JOE: 
I hate it when they do that. 
Sighing, he pulls a bottle from under the cash register,takes a long pull, and collapses onto a beat up stool. 
INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY 
Dan Sims studies reports, reading each sheet, setting itaside, and wearily going on to the nEXT. He pauses. 
SIMS: 
Barnaby? You see this DUI report? 
Barnaby, at the next desk, glances up. 
BARNABY: 
You mean that old guy Pogue? 
SIMS: 
Yeah. 
BARNABY: 
Sure. 
SIMS: 
Did it occur to you, this old guy Pogue, who waspulled over in the vicinity of a warehouse that just happens tobelong to a suspect named Pogue, might be a relative? 
BARNABY: 
Page 55/96
Sure. 
SIMS: 
Sure? 
BARNABY: 
Yeah, it's his uncle. 
SIMS: 
His uncle? 
BARNABY: 
Yeah. 
Sims stares ceilingward, praying for patience. 
SIMS: 
Barnaby, were you going to tell me this? 
BARNABY: 
Yeah, I probably would have gotten around to it. 
Sims struggles into his jacket. 
SIMS: 
Barnaby, I am really trying to like you. 
BARNABY: 
We going somewhere? 
SIMS: 
Yeah, Barnaby, I thought we might pay a visit toMr. Pogue's uncle. INT. MOTEL #2/ROOM - DAY (RAINING) 
Emily comes out of the bathroom, wearing a towel and rubbingher hair with another, smoking a cigarette. 
The key rattles and Will stalks in, soaked, halts dead. 
EMILY: 
Did you get him? 
WILL: 
Who? 
He settles warily into a chair, as far from her as physicallypossible -- by the door. 
EMILY: 
Page 56/96
Whoever it is you keep calling. 
WILL: 
You take too many damn showers. 
She grabs her clothes off the floor and stalks into thebathroom, leaving the door partially ajar. 
Will, uncomfortable as hell, tries to ignore flashes offlesh, as she walks back and forth in there, to the accompaniment of zippersand sliding material. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
Is there really a priest? 
EMILY: 
The nuns at school used to make us go to church-- which was boring as hell -- so I used to go to confession --to shock the priests. Told 'em I slept with all these army guysand stuff. 
WILL: 
What's so shocking about that? 
EMILY: 
I was nine. 
She comes out of the bathroom, tosses herself on the bed,sniffs her shirt sleeve, grimaces, shuts her eyes. 
EMILY (CONT'D) 
God I hate dirty clothes. 
WILL: 
These priests all believed a nine year old girlwas sleeping with army guys? 
EMILY: 
I think Father Douglas is the only one who caughton. 
She shuts her eyes. 
He shuts his eyes. 
He puts his feet up on the table. 
Shifts. Shifts again. Opens his eyes. Shuts them. Emilyopens her eyes and glares. 
EMILY: 
If the chair's so god damned uncomfortable, sleepon the bed. Your virtue will remain intact. 
WILL: 
I'm used to sleeping alone. 
Page 57/96
EMILY: 
I'll bet. All those frigging locks. 
She tosses back down into the pillows, turning away fromhim. He turns onto his side, facing away from her. 
The rain beats down. 
There they both lie, wide awake. 
EMILY (CONT'D) 
Pogue, are you planning on being a car thief allyour life? 
WILL: 
Are you planning on being a thorn in your father'sside all your life? Stony silence. Will sighs. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
I'm going to Tahiti. 
EMILY: 
You're going to steal cars in Tahiti? That's progress. 
WILL: 
I'm going to fish. And I'm going to go first class. 
EMILY: 
Oh, right. So what will you live on? Fish? 
WILL: 
I have investments. 
Emily laughs -- bitter. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
What's so funny? 
EMILY: 
Here I thought I'd met an honest thief -- and youhave investments. She's really laughing now -- but it's a brittle laugh. EMILY (CONT'D) 
Just like my father. Next, you'll tell me you havea tree fetish. 
WILL: 
Believe you me, hard as I tried, I could never fucksomeone up as bad as you're fucked up over your old man. 
She stops laughing. He glances over at her. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
Don't tell me I hurt your feelings. 
She throws back the covers, stumps out of bed. 
Page 58/96
EMILY: 
You take the bed. I'll sleep in the chair. 
He shakes his head no, crosses his arms. 
WILL: 
Chair's by the door. 
EMILY: 
Jesus, God. Look, I give you my word, I will notleave, while you're asleep. Okay? Because I would rather see youget some sleep than end up somewhere dead on the highway. Will thatwork? My solemn oath. 
He looks at her, skeptical. 
INT. JOE'S AUTO PARTS - DAY 
The bell JANGLES over the door and Dan Sims walks in, Barnabyplodding along behind him. The only living thing in sight is an old GermanShepherd in the corner -- it wags its tail. 
SIMS: 
Anybody here? 
JOE (O.S.) 
Yeah, yeah, hold on. 
Sims leans down to pet the dog. Joe comes out of the back,glares at the dog. 
JOE: 
Veronica, you're supposed to bite the burglars,not welcome them in. Veronica's tail wags harder. 
JOE (CONT'D) 
What can I do you for? 
Dan flashes a badge. 
SIMS: 
Are you Joseph Pogue? 
JOE: 
Nope. He ain't here. 
Sims squints at Joe. 
SIMS: 
When do you expect him back? 
JOE: 
Dunno. He went on a fishing trip. Maybe a week orso. 
Page 59/96

SIMS: 
Would you happen to know where? 
JOE: 
Nope. 
SIMS: 
How about his nephew, William Pogue? You ever seehim around here? 
JOE: 
Sorry. Only worked here a coupla weeks. 
Sims gives him a hard look. 
SIMS: 
And what would your name be? 
JOE: 
Dennis Hodges. 
SIMS: 
You got any identification, Dennis Hodges? 
JOE: 
Nope. 
Sims glowers. Joe shrugs. 
JOE (CONT'D) 
I don't drive. 
SIMS: 
You know it's against the law to lie to a policeofficer, Mr. Hodges? 
JOE: 
Now I do. 
Sims slaps his card on the counter. 
SIMS: 
You hear from Pogue, you call me. 
JOE: 
Will do. 
Sims and Barnaby JANGLE out the door. Joe picks up the card,studies it. Page 60/96

JOE: 
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. 
The Shepherd flops its tail.

Sims steams. Barnaby starts the engine. 
SIMS: 
There is something wrong here. I don't know what,but something is not right. 
BARNABY: 
You mean with Pogue? 
SIMS: 
What do you mean, "Do you mean with Pogue"? 
Barnaby inclines his head towards Joe's Auto Parts. 
BARNABY: 
That was him back there. 
SIMS: 
How can you tell? The station picture is shit. 
BARNABY: 
Went to school with him. 
Sims' jaw drops. 
SIMS: 
You might have said something sooner. 
Barnaby shrugs. 
BARNABY: 
You want to go back and talk to him? 
SIMS: 
Oh, right. Excuse me, Mr. Pogue. My partner justhappened to mention. . . he won't tell us anything now. 
BARNABY: 
Nope. 
SIMS: 
But I want the place watched. 
Page 61/96
BARNABY: 
Okey-dokey. 
Barnaby pulls out. Sims jerks his seat belt forward -- itsticks. Disgusted, he drops it, past trying to get the damn thing to work. 
INT. THOMAS PERKINS' NEW AND IMPROVED DISCREET AUTOMOBILE(OUTSIDE JOE'S AUTO PARTS) - DAY 
Thomas, expressionless and immaculate as always, watchesBarnaby and Sims pull away. 
Beside him on the seat, the red LED on a high tech phonemonitoring device blinks. 
INT. UNDERCOVER CAR - DAY 
Barnaby drives, nonchalant. Dan Sims broods. 
SIMS: 
Barnaby, let me ask you a question. 
BARNABY: 
Shoot. 
SIMS: 
What do you think is happening here? 
Barnaby scratches his neck, thinks a moment. 
BARNABY: 
You want to know what I think? 
Sims is getting belligerent. 
SIMS: 
Yeah. Just out of curiosity, I want to know whatyou think. 
BARNABY: 
Well, lemme see. I think old man Hope thought hisdaughter was setting him up, so he didn't get too riled, thoughthe'd just play along. Then, when the car wasn't there with her init, he got worried and called in the big guns -- that'd be our mysteriousMr. Perkins. But the kidnapper we're after wasn't a kidnapper, hewas a car thief -- seeing as he's Joe Pogue's nephew, and Poguesaren't into kidnapping, they're into cars. You know his daddy wasa racer? So the kid took the car, but then he found the girl init, which put him in a fix. So he was trying to figure out whatto do about it, without getting tangled up with the law, when thatold lady put the finger on him and the cops showed up. Then he ran-- skittish lot, the Pogues -- and the girl probably went with him-- but he forgot to take the coffee off, so the whole place burneddown. Now old Pogue's sweating it, 'cause he hasn't heard from hisnephew in a while, and young Pogue and that girl are 
Page 62/96
somewhere outin tarnation. 
Sims just stares, slack jawed. Barnaby glances at him. 
BARNABY (CONT'D) 
That's what I think. 
SIMS: 
You thought that all out. 
BARNABY: 
Yep. 
SIMS: 
And you never thought to mention it. 
BARNABY: 
You didn't ask. 
Sims collapses back into his seat, thinking. 
SIMS: 
What makes you think the kid's a car thief? 
BARNABY: 
Got busted way back, musta been about fourteen atthe time, for auto. Bad crowd he was running with, after his daddydied. 
SIMS: 
He did. 
Barnaby nods. 
BARNABY: 
You'd know these things, if you were from aroundhere. 
SIMS: 
You don't like me much, do you Barnaby? 
BARNABY: 
I got nothing against you. I just wonder, sometimes,how come you're out here, instead of back in your own town. 
Seconds tick by as Sims considers. 
SIMS: 
You ever been to Los Angeles, Barnaby? 
BARNABY: 
Page 63/96

Nope. 
INT. MOTEL #2/ROOM - DAY (RAINING HARD) 
RAIN beats against the roof. Thunder RUMBLES and Will jerksawake, stares around the room panicked, relaxes when he remembers wherehe is -- And stiffens when he sees Emily's gone. 
WILL: 
God damn it. 
He struggles free of tangled bed clothes, jerks open thedoor to stare out at the gray sheet of rain, and cursing, plunges into it. 
EXT. MOTEL #2/PARKING LOT - DAY 
Will, dashing through the rain -- 
WILL: 
Stupid stupid stupid -- 
The car is still there, and intact. 
He turns to stare at the abandoned lot. 
The neon motel sign spits in the gray rain, shooting weakillumination. Even the office looks dead. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
Shit. I give you my solemn oath. Yeah, right. Stupidstupid stupid. LIGHTNING shoots across the sky, casting everything intoblack and white lines, and there, on the hill behind the hotel, is a small,still figure standing in the rain. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
Emily? 
He wipes rain off his face -- like that does any good --and trudges up the hill through a growing stream of mud and water. And sureenough, it's her. WILL (CONT'D) 
Emily, what are you doing out here? 
She just stands there, holding the front of her shirt awayfrom her body to stare down at an enormous black blotch on it, as the rainsleets down her. 
EMILY: 
I stained my shirt. 
WILL: 
What? 
EMILY: 
I was playing with the god damn motel pen, and itbroke, and now I've got ink all over my shirt. 
Will stares at the ragged shirt -- scruffy, torn, dirty-- he laughs. Page 64/96

WILL: 
Emily, that shirt needs to be burned. 
EMILY: 
I hate god damn stains. 
Emily starts crying. He blanches, puts his hands on hershoulders, staring at her in consternation. 
WILL: 
Hey, hey, it's just a beat up old shirt. 
This isn't having the desired effect -- she's bawling. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
We'll buy you a new one. Here, you can have my shirt-- 
He's struggling out his shirt. 
EMILY: 
No no no. The rain comes and it washes the wholeworld clean. It just doesn't wash the people clean. We're all stained,Will. 
WILL: 
How long have you been out here, Emily? 
She shrugs. He takes her hands, rubs them. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
Jesus, you're cold. Come on. 
He tugs. She resists, rain plastering her face and hair.He wipes a sodden strand out of her face. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
Anybody can change, Emily. 
EMILY: 
Like you're going to change, Will, when you getto Tahiti? INT. MOTEL #2/ROOM - DAY (RAINING) 
They're soaked and Emily's teeth are chattering as Willpushes her into the motel room chair and crouches to drag her shoes offand rub her feet. 
EMILY: 
That hurts. 
WILL: 
I bet. 
He grabs a discarded towel, rubs her hair. 
EMILY: 
Rain never killed anyone. 
Page 65/96
WILL: 
The hell it didn't. You've got to get out of theseclothes. She smiles, tired. He meets her eyes -- eyes for once candidand just plain young and tired. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
Thanks for not leaving. 
She reaches out with a cold, gentle hand, to touch his face,so close, leans forward, kisses him. . . . 
It's a long kiss -- before he breaks away. She frees thefirst button of her shirt. 
WILL: 
No. 
EMILY: 
I need you. 
WILL: 
You don't need me. You need something, but it'snot me. 
EMILY: 
Don't you ever get lonely, Will Pogue? Living behindall your locks and chains and secrets, don't you ever need anotherhuman being? 
WILL: 
I can't afford the stakes you play for, Emily. 
EMILY: 
Yes you can, Will. Just for a moment. Just to behuman. 
And she kisses him again, and what he should do -- or mightregret -- doesn't matter. 
INT. MOTEL #2/ROOM - DAY 
Emily lies awake by Will's side in the bed, staring at theceiling, listening to Will's soft breathing. He rolls over, kisses her,smiles one of those shit eating grins everyone wears, when they're in lovewith the world because they just got laid. 
WILL: 
Hi. 
EMILY: 
Hi. 
Page 66/96
She's distant. Will drags clothes off a chair, frowns atthe wrinkled suit, but climbs into it anyway. 
WILL: 
You okay? 
EMILY: 
I don't want to go back. 
He loses a bit of the rosy glow. 
WILL: 
Emily, it's hard truth time. I have to go back.I have to check on someone. And you have to go back. To clear upthis mess. 
He straps on his watch. She turns to stare at the wall.He touches her face. WILL (CONT'D) 
I would truly love to hide out here with you forever,but that's not going to work, and you know it. For one thing, becauseUncle Tom is going to come through that door one of these days andkill me dead for making you suck my penis. 
He smiles, trying. 
EMILY: 
Fine. 
She grabs her clothes off the floor and drags them on, purposefullyignoring the stain. 
WILL: 
God, I could eat a horse. 
INT. RESTAURANT/PAY PHONE - DAY 
Will, relieved enough to be rude, speaks into the phone. 
WILL: 
Where the hell have you been? 
INT. JOE'S AUTO PARTS/LIVING QUARTERS - DAY 
Joe, casual, speaks into the phone. 
intercut: 
JOE: 
Jail. 
WILL: 
Jail? 
Page 67/96
JOE: 
Yep. 
WILL: 
What the hell -- 
JOE: 
Pardon me for intruding, Will, but did you knowyour warehouse burned to the ground? 
WILL: 
Yeah, I know. 
JOE: 
I ask because I don't know if you've got TV's whereyou're at. 
WILL: 
You want to know what's going on? 
JOE: 
Nope. Nope. I don't want to know. I'd rather notknow. But I thought it might be good to be sure you know. 
WILL: 
I know. 
JOE: 
Then I figure you'll take care of it. When're youcoming home? 
WILL: 
I'm on my way. 
JOE: 
Well that's good. Things're a might peculiar aroundhere, though. You might want to wear a hat. 
WILL: 
I'll do that, Uncle Joe. 
(beat) 
Uncle Joe, there haven't been any strangers around,asking questions, have there? Maybe a guy in a suit? 
JOE: 
A nice suit, or a cheap suit? 
Page 68/96
WILL: 
A nice suit. 
JOE: 
Just cops. 
WILL: 
That's good. 
INT. THOMAS PERKINS' NEW AND IMPROVED DISCREET AUTOMOBILE- DAY Thomas smiles -- not a nice smile -- snaps off his phonetapping device, and straightens his cuff, obscuring a military tattoo. 
INT. RESTAURANT - DAY 
Emily, shivering slightly, picks at her food, looking miserable.A plate of fish sits across the table from her, growing cold. 
Will slides into the booth. 
EMILY: 
You get through? 
WILL: 
Yep. 
EMILY: 
Congratulations. I ordered you the fish. 
WILL: 
Oh. 
He eyes the congealing creature with an expression lessthan rapturous, but takes a manful bite and swallows. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
Said the cops have been by. 
EMILY: 
What's wrong with the fish? 
WILL: 
Nothing. What I'm going to do is drop you off atthe police station. Then I'm going to get the hell out of there,while you go in and introduce yourself. 
Emily, watching him wince his way through the fish, eyeshis plate, frowns. 
EMILY: 
What's wrong with it. 
Page 69/96
Will sets down his fork with a sigh. 
WILL: 
Emily, I'm sorry. I hate fish. 
EMILY: 
You hate fish. 
She stares out the window -- coming to a decision here,building up inside defenses -- 
EMILY (CONT'D) 
I think you should go to Tahiti, Will. Just geton that plane and go. Forget all this mess -- and take a few steaksalong, for insurance purposes. 
WILL: 
Am I missing something here? 
EMILY: 
Missing something? 
She gives him a cool stare. 
WILL: 
Maybe I'm taking a lot for granted. But I thoughtsomething happened here. 
EMILY: 
Yeah, something happened here. It's called sex,Will. 
WILL: 
Uh huh. 
EMILY: 
And suddenly, after having sex, you seem to be thinkingI'm going to be changed into a nice person and I'm going to go trottinginto some police station and announce myself to the world. 
Will isn't attempting to eat fish anymore. 
EMILY (CONT'D) 
Don't ever make that mistake, Will, of thinkingI'm a nice person, just because we had sex, because if there's onething I'm not, it's nice. Will's sitting there, waiting for the punch line. It doesn'tcome. The silence grows. 
EMILY (CONT'D) 
I'm pregnant, Will. 
He stares at her blankly. 
WILL: 
Page 70/96
There's no way. 
EMILY: 
Not last night. Before last night. 
WILL: 
How -- oh, shit. 
He's working through it, adjusting -- comes back at herjust as tough as she's coming at him. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
I can live with that. 
Ouch -- she didn't expect that -- she recovers fast. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
Who? 
She hits him with a hard, cold stare -- these are the bigguns. EMILY (CONT'D) 
I don't really remember. 
She pulls out a cigarette, lights up. 
Will stares at it, at her, the implications sinking in. 
She blows smoke, a thin cloud growing between them. 
Will 
Emily? 
EMILY: 
What, you're still here? 
WILL: 
No. You're right. I think it's time I go. 
He stands stiffly and stalks for the door. 
Emily watches him go with a crooked, pained smile. 
EXT. JOE'S AUTO PARTS - DAY 
Thomas Perkins strolls to the door of the shop, sparinga casual glance for the undercover car outside -- 
INT. SECOND UNDERCOVER CAR - DAY 
A weary detective watches Joe's place, Will's high schoolyearbook photo on the seat beside him, and, unfortunately, the detectivedoesn't know, or care, who Thomas Perkins is, and spares him only a passingglance. INT. JOE'S AUTO PARTS - DAY 
The door JANGLES and Thomas strolls to the counter. TheGerman Shepherd flops its tail against the wall. Joe, behind the counter,glances up, studies Perkins' suit. 
JOE (CONT'D) 
Sorry, I'm closed. 
Page 71/96
PERKINS: 
Joseph Pogue? 
JOE: 
He ain't here. 
Thomas 
Really? Then perhaps you can tell me where he is? 
JOE: 
Got no idea. You wanna leave a message, though,I'll see he gets it when he comes back. 
Thomas slides a fifty dollar bill onto the counter. 
Thomas 
I would like very much to speak with him. 
Joe eyes the money. 
JOE: 
That's too bad, 'cause he ain't here. 
Thomas's eyes narrow and he retracts the fifty. 
PERKINS: 
Mr. Pogue, you may not want my money, but you aregoing to speak to me. Silence. 
PERKINS (CONT'D) 
Perhaps you don't understand, Mr. Pogue. I'm veryserious. 
JOE: 
I told you, Joe Pogue ain't here. 
Thomas pulls a gun (silenced) from his shoulder holster,turns, and shoots the German Shepherd dead. 
JOE (CONT'D) 
Veronica? 
PERKINS: 
As I said, Mr. Pogue, I'm very serious. 
Joe wobbles around the counter's edge, not quite believingthat old dog is dead. 
JOE: 
Oh, shit, Veronica? 
INT. PERKINS' DISCREET AUTOMOBILE - DAY 
Will drives, seriously pissed, passing Highway Five Southsigns too fast -- and then it hits him. 
Page 72/96
WILL: 
She's lying. 
He jerks the wheel and screeches to a halt on the shoulder-- which gets him an unfriendly HORN blast from the car behind him -- andlaughs, amazed. WILL (CONT'D) 
Man, she is good. Those poor priests. 
And then he sobers. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
If she's not lying, you are about to make one hellof a fool of yourself, William Pogue. 
He stares out the window, drumming his fingers on the wheel.Drumming drumming drumming -- 
WILL (CONT'D) 
Fuck it. 
He spins the wheel and makes a very illegal U-turn. 
EXT. RECTORY - DAY 
Will rings the bell, shifts feet a few times, waiting. TheRECTORY PRIEST opens the door. 
RECTORY PRIEST: 
May I help you? 
WILL: 
I'm looking for Father Douglas? 
The Priest studies Will, who's not up to boy scout standardstoday -- in fact, Will resembles a seriously scruffy character. 
RECTORY PRIEST: 
I'm sorry, he's unavailable. Perhaps you could tellme what this is regarding? 
WILL: 
No, I need to speak to Father Douglas personally.Could you tell me where he went? 
The priest checks his watch. 
RECTORY PRIEST: 
He should be back in a couple of hours, if you'dlike to come back. The priest starts to shut the door -- starts, only, becauseWill blocks it. 
WILL: 
This is urgent. 
RECTORY PRIEST: 
Page 73/96

If it's urgent, you can talk to me. 
Will's losing patience. 
WILL: 
No, I need to speak to Father Douglas. 
RECTORY PRIEST: 
Then I can't help you. 
The priest starts to shut the door again -- 
Will strong arms the door. 
WILL: 
Look you, I need to speak to Father Douglas, andI need to speak to him now. The priest blanches. 
RECTORY PRIEST: 
Father Douglas is taking confessions. 
WILL: 
Thank you. 
INT. CHURCH - DAY 
Will Pogue's footsteps echo, slap slap slap, across thehard floor. It's an intimidating church, but he's not into being intimidatedright now, he's into getting to the confessional. Still -- he genuflectsand shoots a token knee bend at the alter, old habits dying hard. 
At the confessional, there's a line. He pauses, less sureof himself, takes his place at the end. 
And way up there, at the front of the line, there are twoconfessionals. He studies them. 
WILL: 
What now? 
A WOMAN in front of him turns. 
WOMAN: 
Excuse me? 
WILL: 
Nothing. Sorry. 
She eyes his wrinkled clothing, before turning a stiff backon him. Nothing for it, he waits -- receiving odd glances from littleold ladies ahead of and behind him. 
INT. RECTORY - DAY 
The rectory priest dials an old fashioned, black, rotaryphone. Page 74/96

INT. CHURCH - DAY 
Will's next in line. An elderly woman steps from one ofthe confessionals. He plunges in. 
INT. CONFESSIONAL - DAY 
Will sits awkwardly in the booth. The shade rolls back. 
WILL: 
Are you Father Douglas? 
The PRIEST clears his throat -- a hint. Will crosses himself. WILL (CONT'D) 
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned repeatedlyand it's been years since my last confession, but if you aren'tFather Douglas, I don't want to talk to you. 
PRIEST: 
May I ask why, then, you're here? 
WILL: 
I'm looking for a girl. 
Silence. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
So if you could just tell me -- 
PRIEST: 
Did you say you were looking for a girl? 
WILL: 
Uh, maybe I should explain -- 
PRIEST: 
Next door. 
Will boggles. 
WILL: 
Excuse me? 
PRIEST: 
Next door. 
WILL: 
A girl? 
PRIEST: 
Page 75/96
You'll find Father Douglas in the next confessional. 
WILL: 
Oh. Uh, okay. 
PRIEST: 
Unless, of course, you'd like to take advantageof the circumstances. 
WILL: 
No, I'll just be going now. 
Will reaches for the door -- 
INT. CHURCH - DAY 
Will, crimson faced, takes his place at the end of the lineagain. He's getting truly curious glances from waiting confessors. 
INT. CHURCH - DAY 
Will's first in line again. An elderly woman steps fromthe confessional he entered the first time. Drat! He pretends not to notice,shifts his weight, staring at the second confessional. 
WILL: 
(under his breath) 
Come on, come on -- 
A WOMAN behind him taps him on the shoulder. 
WOMAN: 
I think it's free now. 
WILL: 
Uh, no, you go ahead. I'm waiting for the next one. 
She ogles him, before going ahead. He's embarrassed as hell,getting stares, standing there, trying to be cool. A woman steps out ofthe second confessional and he bolts for it. 
EXT. RECTORY - DAY 
A police cruiser pulls to the curb. As the COP steps fromthe cruiser, the rectory priest Will had the doorway altercation with stepsforward to meet him. 
INT. SECOND CONFESSIONAL - DAY 
Will sits awkwardly in the booth, relieved to be off display-- until the shade rolls back. 
WILL: 
Father Douglas? 
The PRIEST coughs, a hint. Will genuflects -- stops himself. WILL (CONT'D) 
Page 76/96
Look, the guy next door said you were Father Douglas,and I've got to talk to Father Douglas, so you either are or arenot Father Douglas. Silence. Will starts to sweat. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
If you are, I need to talk to you. If you aren't,just tell me where Father Douglas is -- I'll get out of your hairand you won't have to worry about me till last rites. 
It is, by the way, FATHER DOUGLAS. 
FATHER DOUGLAS: 
It might be wise to see me sooner than that. 
WILL: 
Are you Father Douglas, or aren't you? 
FATHER DOUGLAS: 
I'll be through here in an hour. Perhaps we couldspeak at that time? 
WILL: 
You're Father Douglas. 
FATHER DOUGLAS: 
Yes. 
Will expels a big sigh of relief. 
WILL: 
I have a message for Emily Hope. 
Silence. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
You do know Emily Hope? 
FATHER DOUGLAS: 
Are you Catholic? 
WILL: 
What does that have to do with it? 
FATHER DOUGLAS: 
Answer the question, please. 
Will glances around guiltily. 
WILL: 
Yes. 
Page 77/96
FATHER DOUGLAS: 
Then you know I can't answer your question. 
Will's about had it with obstacles. He rips out paper andpen, and scribbles. 
WILL: 
Fine. I'm writing down an address and phone number.And if you should happen to see Emily Hope, you tell her I can bereached here for the next twenty-four hours. And then I'm gone. 
Will shoves the paper through the grill. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
Oh, and Father? Tell her I thought she was tougherthan this. INT. CHURCH - DAY 
Will, stepping out of the confessional, stops dead whenhe sees the rectory priest approaching with the COP. 
WILL: 
Aw, shit. 
RECTORY PRIEST: 
That's him, officer. 
Will, looking for somewhere, anywhere, to hide, ducks backinto the confessional. 
The confession crowd is wild with anticipation. 
The cop comes to a dead stop outside the confessional. 
COP: 
I can't go in there. 
The rectory priest raps on the door. 
RECTORY PRIEST: 
Young man, come out of there immediately! 
No answer. 
RECTORY PRIEST (CONT'D) 
Do you hear me, young man? I said come out! 
Father Douglas, looking holier than God, steps from theconfessional, to the further excitement of the crowd -- 
FATHER DOUGLAS: 
What is the meaning of this? 
The cop pales -- he wasn't prepared for a stand off withGod. 
RECTORY PRIEST: 
The man inside -- 
Page 78/96
FATHER DOUGLAS: 
Is a confessor. Since it is not, as far as I know,yet a crime to attend confession, we are not yet in the habit ofdragging confessors out of the booth. Am I clear, Father Michael? 
RECTORY PRIEST: 
Very, Father Douglas. 
Father Douglas turns to the cop. 
FATHER DOUGLAS: 
Thank you for coming. Your services won't be necessarytoday. The cop nods, gulps, and goes. Father Douglas turns to therectory priest. FATHER DOUGLAS (CONT'D) 
Would you care to explain? 
The rectory priest falters, casts an anxious glance at theavid spectators -- at this point, no one is entering either of the confessionals.He lowers his voice. 
RECTORY PRIEST: 
I was concerned for your safety, and. . . 
(oh, this is going to sound bad) 
RECTORY PRIEST (CONT'D) 
I called the police. 
FATHER DOUGLAS: 
I see. 
The rectory priest shoots a dour glance at the booth. 
RECTORY PRIEST: 
He was quite forceful. 
Father Douglas sighs, opens the confessional door. Willand he lock eyes. 
FATHER DOUGLAS: 
It was good seeing you again, William. 
Will reacts, eyes narrowing momentarily. 
WILL: 
Right. Good seeing you again, Father. 
Will steps awkwardly from the booth. 
FATHER DOUGLAS: 
And William? 
Page 79/96
WILL: 
Yes? 
FATHER DOUGLAS: 
Ten Hail Marys, ten Our Fathers. 
Will's jaw drops. 
FATHER DOUGLAS (CONT'D) 
You may go. 
WILL: 
Right. 
Will GOES. Father Douglas turns back to the rectory priest. INT. JOE'S AUTO PARTS/LIVING QUARTERS - DAY 
The place is a reflection of Joe: old, worn -- too muchbad news has passed through here, leaving behind a yellowed, tarnished toneof loss that clings to every item in the room. Joe himself is not lookingtoo good right now either -- probably because Thomas Perkins is beatingthe crap out of him. Thomas pauses. Joe coughs. Thomas lifts Joe's bottle andoffers Joe a swig, which Joe takes thankfully. 
PERKINS: 
Joe, you have to understand, I don't enjoy beatingup old men. Especially military men like yourself. But your nephewis in possession of something I must find. 
JOE: 
Don't know where he is. Haven't heard from him.In days. 
PERKINS: 
Really, Joe. 
Perkins gently removes the bottle from Joe's hands. 
PERKINS (CONT'D) 
We both know you're lying. 
Joe reaches pleadingly after the bottle. 
JOE: 
Please -- 
PERKINS: 
Sorry, Joe. 
Thomas hits him again. 
EXT. CHURCH - DAY 
Will stands in the shadows, watching the cop study Will's"borrowed" automobile.
