[suspenseful music playing]

[man] The kingdom, Niklaus,

the kingdom.

You must defend the kingdom.

[grunting, sobbing]

[sobbing]

[suspenseful music continues]

[man] These pieces,

these soldiers,

they're your only defense

of the kingdom.

The kingdom. [echoes]

[screaming voices]

[indistinct shouting]

[woman panting]

The kingdom.

- Welcome, Jane.

- It's good to be here.

Well, this time around.

[chuckles] I completely understand,

Jane, and it's good to see you too.

Amy is very excited

to be going home.

So, tell me, are you still

at the same address?

I am.

And that's

the same address where...

Well, we're not going

straight home, Doctor.

We're actually

visiting relatives

at a really nice

bed-and-breakfast, Anders Manor.

I thought...

neutral territory,

familiar faces, her cousins.

She was really close with them

when she was little.

Jane...

I'm worried about her

flashing back to the...

accident.

Well, we're going.

[opera music playing]

What is this, Father?

This... it's a game, Niklaus.

Like checkers?

[laughs] No, checkers

is for the simpletons.

For the babies,

like tic-tac-toe.

This, this is chess.

The game of kings.

[music fades out]

The game of kings.

So, happy birthday.

Are you excited

to see the family?

A little bit.

I remember

Uncle Ethan was funny.

Aunt Eva was weird, but caring.

Trevor was always nice.

I don't know. It seems like

such a long time ago.

Everything's kind of a blur.

I just can't believe you're 18.

I can't either.

It's like I woke up with tits all of a sudden

and they let me out of the loony bin for it.

[laughs] Hey.

Well...

[Jane] Are you sure you're ready

for this?

Because you and I can go

to a hotel by ourselves.

I want this.

We both deserve a vacation

at this point.

Well...

let's go have some fun.

[doorbell rings]

Ladies.

A gracious new day to you both.

- Come in, come in. Please.

- Thank you.

Welcome to Anders Manor.

- I am Niklaus Anders.

- I am Jane.

- And this is my daughter, Amy.

- Amy, nice to meet you.

We're Jane and Amy Hunter. My sister, Eva

Clark, made the reservations for us.

- Is she here yet?

- She's not here at the moment.

They're on an outing,

but they'll be back

and they've instructed me

to remind you...

- Let me take your bags, please.

- Thank you.

And let's get you all...

nestled in snugly here.

[Jane] Thank you.

[Jane] This place is lovely.

How long have you been here?

[scoffs]

Sometimes it seems like forever.

This was my father's place.

His father built it by hand

over a hundred years ago...

Am I a king, Father?

[chuckles] Well...

you may be a prince.

And I the king.

The king of Anders Manor.

[echoes]

[Niklaus] So, we've set aside

a particularly lovely room

that I think will be perfectly

suitable to the young lady.

It's just down here.

Your first door on the left.

So, if you would.

You know what, I'll take

mine as well. -Sure.

[eerie music playing]

[gasps]

[gasps, sobbing]

[Amy grunts]

- Amy.

- No.

Um... I think someone's

already staying in there.

No, not possible.

It's a room I rarely rent out.

It belonged

to a dear cousin of mine.

Amy, see? There's nobody

in that room, sweetie.

No. No, it's fine. It's fine. There's

nothing in there, right, Mom?

- Right. There's nothing in that room.

- Nothing there.

Okay. She's fine.

So, your daughter...

She has a mental illness,

I'm afraid.

Well, I am so sorry.

She's such a lovely girl.

She is a very sweet girl.

It's just, sometimes she sees

things that aren't actually there.

Well, I can assure you that, for as

long as she's here at the manor,

she'll have all the peace

and tranquility that she needs.

Thank you so much.

That's why we're here, you know,

we just want a fresh start.

Well, toward that point,

we will be having additional guests

here this evening, some hunters.

They'll be joining us for dinner

at 4:
00 p.m.,

after which, we'll be having

a cotton candy social,

and a bonfire on the grounds.

I think I'll catch up with my

sister tonight, but thank you.

As you wish.

[Young Niklaus]

Teach me to play, Father.

Well...

This is the king.

The most powerful piece

on the board.

And yet, the weakest,

the most vulnerable.

The outcome of the game

depends on his survival.

Like a father,

he leads and loves.

He loves and leads.

And when he dies...

that's it.

The game is over.

[doorbell rings]

[woman exhales] Jane.

[laughs]

Oh. Christ, Jane,

it's been so long.

I know.

You look great.

Please, I've been driving all day.

You look great, as always.

[chuckles]

Hello, Janie. Who doesn't lie

about things of beauty?

You look just like you did

at the wedding.

That was 20 years ago, Ethan.

- Hi, guys.

- [both] Hi.

- [Jane] Let's go catch up.

- [woman] Okay.

[pop music playing]

Sweetie, it's time for dinner.

- I'll be down in a minute.

- Okay.

Oh, happy birthday, Amy.

Thanks.

You remember

your Uncle Ethan, right?

We haven't seen you since you were

ass-high to a grasshopper, but...

you used to play with Trevor

and Blair in the backyard.

I remember.

Well, it's good

to see you again, honey.

Hi, Aunt Eva.

Hi, sweetie.

Hi, Blair. Hi, Trevor.

Hi, Amy. It's nice to see you

again, too, and you look great.

Well, it has been awhile.

So, how were things

at the funny farm, coz?

Damn it, Blair, come on.

Highly inappropriate,

young lady.

And Blair, is your ass jealous from all the

sh*t that just came out of your mouth?

Damn it, Trevor.

You know, Trevor,

I really would like to see things

from your point of view, but...

I can't get my head

that far up my own ass.

Wow, your children really have

grown up so much, haven't they?

Blair and Trevor,

I love you both very much,

but if you don't stop,

- you won't believe what happens next.

- [giggles]

Excuse me, please.

I'm not hungry.

Welcome to the fun.

[knock on door]

If you'll excuse me.

[door squeaks]

The huntsmen have arrived!

Gentlemen, welcome, welcome.

Come in, come in, come in.

- Welcome to Anders Manor.

- Thank you, sir.

I trust that your travels were without

undue difficulty? -All good, sir.

You would be Brett, I presume,

and these your compatriots.

Yes, sir.

My brother, Darsaw.

- Very nice to meet you.

- Much obliged, Mr. Anders.

And I cannot thank you enough for

opening up your fine grounds to us,

so we may kill and eat

some indigenous wildlife.

Yes. And this would be?

- And Ole.

- Ole, pleasure to meet you, sir.

Pleasure, sir. My name's Ole.

Outstanding, Ole.

[Brett] And may I say,

you have a lovely looking

establishment here.

[Niklaus] Well,

thank you very much.

Dinner's being served presently.

Put your bags down, please, relax.

The Reverend Thomas

will be joining us presently.

He's on his way.

He'll be presiding later this evening

over a cotton candy social and bonfire.

Thank you, sir. In reference

to our arrangement for our rate,

my brother Darsaw here, will be

willing to cut your firewood up.- Very good.

- I will?

Yes, you will.

Well, I'm assuming

you're all hungry, correct?

- Very.

- Please, come with me.

"Very."

Ladies and gentlemen, it is

my pleasure to present to you,

Darsaw, Ole, and Brett,

the Bayton boys.

They're here to do some

buck hunting this weekend.

Hey, y'all.

[violent, high-pitch noise]

[Ole sniffling]

Damn, Darsaw, you sure

know how to clear out a room.

Back at the manor.

[exhales] Our annual

fall prison sentence.

Mm, I love it.

- Mm-hm.

- I f***ing hate this place.

You know what I did love...

[blows smoke]

...was the meal that

Charlie Manson served.

Oh! The gray matter?

- The gray matter. It was very nice.

- Delicious.

Did you see the eyeball

in the teeth?

The guy scares me.

He's the weirdest guy

I've ever met.

Mm.

Oh, speaking of the which, um...

Did you see those three hunters

that showed up?

- Maybe.

- They were cute, weren't they?

Maybe.

It's been about an hour and a half.

You haven't f***ed anybody yet?

You mean, like you f***ing your

cousin the last time we were here?

Hm.

That happened.

[humming]

You're adorable. [laughs]

You are adorable. Hm.

[Blair] Hey, lady.

[sighs]

Come on, are you serious?

No, I'm not in town

this weekend. I'm...

with my family at this place

we go a couple times a year

and desperately try

to act normal.

Yeah, [chuckles]

it's called Anders Manor.

It's so lame.

No. [scoffs]

Look, do you remember, um...

that cousin that I told you

about, the super crazy one?

Yeah, well, she checked out of

the loony bin today,

so we're all here to throw her a

"Welcome Back to the Family" party.

[eerie music playing]

Amy, do you understand that even

though you may feel a shock,

it will not break the hypnosis?

You will relax immediately,

noting only the pain,

and its lesson.

You will remain in a trance.

Do you understand that, Amy?

Yes.

Very good.

Now, Amy,

you are a tiny caterpillar,

crawling across a leaf.

What are you, Amy?

I'm a tiny caterpillar.

[electrical crackling]

[grunts]

Very good, Amy.

Now, we're gonna

spin you a cocoon of good drugs

and helpful therapy.

And while you're in that cocoon,

you won't feel any pain.

And when you emerge

from the cocoon...

you will be

a beautiful butterfly.

[electrical crackling]

[grunts]

[Blair sighs]

I'm sorry. I was a complete and

total a**hole to you at dinner.

I didn't want to come this

weekend and my parents made me

and I'm pissed at them,

not at you.

Still cousins?

Look, I feel really bad, okay?

Friends?

Well, boys, you like?

I like.

That MILF,

you see those titties?

Man, wait until you see them

True Believers.

The what?

The True Believers, man. They're

a church group or something.

Man, church girls

don't put out no poon.

Yeah, well, these ones do.

Universalists, or some sh*t.

What about that retarded girl?

Kind of cute.

"Butterface" cute.

Ole, man, listen to me

right now, all right?

That girl broke in the head.

You stay away from her.

I remember playing superheroes

with you and...

pushing you on the swing

when we were six.

You were totally normal.

What happened, Amy?

I got sick.

That's all.

I'm taking meds for it now.

Yeah, but, like,

crazy sick though, right?

Sometimes I don't know

what's real.

And it seems real to me.

Like...

Playing superheroes, but...

But thinking that you're

actually a superhero.

[chuckles] Like an acid trip.

People know they're

hallucinating on an acid trip.

Is there anything I can do to make

up for what I said at dinner?

Yeah.

Do you know how to do makeup?

[laughs]

Step into my office.

I'm gonna make you look

so expensive.

[laughs]

[swing music playing]

Mm-mm-mm!

Like a ripe, juicy fruit.

You're going to get pregnant.

Actually,

I'm on the pill, shithead.

Syphilis then.

Why are you guys

so mean to each other?

- Love.

- Love.

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

The curlers hurt my head.

Beauty is pain, Cousin.

Anyone who tells you otherwise

is selling some bullshit.

[techno music playing]

[man] This is it,

True Believers.

Let's set it up.

Come on, True Believers.

Set it up.

Let's party with the Lord!

[knock on door]

Who is it?

[Eva] It's the Wicked Witch

of the West.

Open the goddamn door.

[chuckles]

Come on in, Eva.

- Hello.

- Hi, honey.

Come over here and have

a drink with me by the window.

And let's watch boys

carry heavy things.

What are we, 16 and 18 again?

Well, let's just pretend

we are, okay?

I mean, I haven't seen you

since the funeral.

That's true.

Oh.

- Yay!

- Mm.

[laughs]

Oh.

- Look, I've gotta tell you...

- Oh my gosh.

...I've got dibs on the one

with the fur hat.

["Phoenix Rising" playing

on radio]

Screaming in colors...

[wood splitting]

[groans]

Well... boys, I'll leave you two

to get settled.

Darsaw...

Thanks for chopping

that firewood there, Pumpkin.

Brett don't chop no wood.

Relax, you big babies.

I'll be back,

and I'll have beer.

[music fades out]

[techno music playing]

We all come together,

and we all go apart.

I said we all come together!

And we all go apart.

Like atoms...

like stars.

Did you get cotton candy?

Ice cream?

So nice to know

your bodies are nourished.

Now, it's time

to nourish our souls.

If you would...

breathe in with me!

And breathe out.

Breathe in with me!

And breathe out.

Welcome...

my True Believers.

[laughter in background]

You, stay.

So, how do you think

she's adjusting?

Well, Ethan,

I already see a difference.

Well, Niklaus did it again.

Everything is wonderful,

as always.

Good. It's good.

Thank you.

Thank you.

God loves you.

Jesus loves you.

Muhammad loves you.

Shiva loves you.

And the Goddess love you.

It doesn't matter

if you believe.

It doesn't matter at all,

love doesn't care.

Brothers and sisters,

love doesn't care.

So, let's crank up the tunes.

[cheering]

Fire up the pit.

[cheering]

And let's rejoice.

Let's rejoice,

in the name of love.

[cheering]

Hello, brothers and sisters.

- What can we do for you, um...

- Darsaw.

Darsaw Bayton.

You see,

I was just feeling the spirit,

and I figured I'd come over and

lend a friendly hand to you all.

[laughs]

Uh, Trevor. Trevor Clark.

Genuine pleasure, Trevor.

I'm Blair.

- Blair Clark.

- Ma'am.

And you are?

Actually, my business is with you, Trevor.

Can I borrow you for a minute?

- Me?

- Of course I can.

Seriously?

My brother, Ole... He pulled

his back out stacking firewood.

You know, he's as useless

as tits on a bull, that one.

And, well, I got a ton of gear in my

truck and it's a two-person lift.

Help a brother out, would you?

Say yes.

I mean, I love that girl

with all of my breaking heart,

but we didn't know

what we were getting into.

I know. I've heard so many stories

of heartbreak when people adopt.

I mean, you just never know what

family history you're gonna get.

- Nice and easy, okay?

- Okay.

- Nice and easy, okay?

- Careful, my hand...

It's slipping.

Nice and easy.

There's precious cargo in here.What the hell.

So...

I gotta ask you...

What's up with you

and old "Barbie?"

- Who, Amy?

- Yeah. She's hot as hell, man.

Oh...

Dude, she's my cousin.

[chuckles]

Big deal.

What, you've probably seen her

three, four, maybe five times

in your life?

Cousin, schmousin.

It's fair game, in my book.

What the hell...

Her and I...

we had a thing.

- You and her?

- Yeah.

Me and Amy,

last trip to the manor.

Yeah, I... I was...

16, and she was 14.

- I knew that I liked you.

- Well, I... It was weird.

I mean, I... It was weird. It...

Weird now even being back here.

I'll bet it is.

Look, we were...

young, you know?

Exploring.

Nothing-better-to-do kind

of stuff.

I could be way off base, but I

think you still kind of like her.

[Trevor chuckles]

Well, maybe, tonight you guys

can rekindle some of that

"manor magic."

[laughs]

No, I don't think so.

But I... I will take

another beer.

[clears throat

All right.

Now you're speaking my language.

[Ole] You like taking pictures?

You almost gave me

a heart attack.

Uh, yeah.

Don't be scared.

I like taking pictures, too.

- Yeah?

- Yeah.

But I like being in them better.

Hey, come on,

take a picture of me.

- What?

- Yeah, that's right.

I'll even pose

right nice for you.

[inhales]

Hmm.

[chuckles] Okay.

Okay, got it.

Okay, okay, let's shoot.

I'll pose again for you.

I'll give you another pose.

We're good.

Let me see.

Excuse me?

Can't you show me

on that little screen of yours?

Uh, I really should get going

back to the party.

You ain't going nowhere.

[screams]

It's a good shot.

You sure can take

a good picture.

Thanks. Uh, I really should

get back to the party.

You have a nice night.

Yeah. You, too.

- Your hair looks so good like this.

- Thanks.

I'll teach you how to do it.

Hey. I'm Ole.

Ole Bayton.

You sure are purtier

than when I saw you earlier.

Don't go.

Stay.

Just wanna be friends.

Excuse me, sister, uh...

You mind if I rap to you

for a minute at the gazebo?

Um-hm.

Brother, you don't mind

if I talk to the sister?

Let me rap for a minute.

Are you all right with that?

[joyful music playing]

[music fades out]

[Thomas] If you can forgive

my bluntness, but sister...

Your aura right now

is screaming, like, whoa!

[chuckles]

Um...

I'm sick.

In my brain.

Bummer.

[laughs]

- You're funny.

- No, sister, it's called charm.

True love.

Compassion.

What makes you sick, sister?

Acute paranoid schizophrenia

with mild hallucinations.

Sometimes, my imagination is real

to my brain, and I can't tell.

And sometimes...

my imagination's

really f***ed up.

Bummer.

Are you on any

kind of treatment right now?

Um, I just got out of in-patient

for four years.

Today?

Yeah... today.

[exhales]

Intense.

Five, four, three, two, one.

Are you relaxed?

Can you hear

the sound of my voice, Amy?

- Yes.

- Good.

Now, let's talk about the night

of the accident.

I don't want to.

Okay.

Let's talk about something else.

Tell me about your dad.

Tell me about David Hunter.

I did a bad thing.

What bad thing, Amy?

I hurt my dad.

He was bleeding.

He stopped moving.

Why did you hurt your dad?

Bastard demon,

Aka Manah, tricked me.

Still.

He's still tricking me.

Aka Manah.

It's a demon that tries

to tell me what to do.

Amy, did you say, "Aka Manah"?

Yeah.

[Amy] It's a demon.

It's part of my psychosis.

But it's... It's made-up.

The doctors told me.

[inhales then exhales]

Well, Amy, I don't mean to give

you hallucinations, but...

Aka Manah

is not a made-up demon.

He isn't?

Tell me about Aka Manah,

the demon.

He scares me.

He tells me bad things.

What kind of bad things?

It's okay.

You can tell me.

You're safe under the trance.

He said,

"Kill him, or die, Amy,"

and I did.

He tricked me...

like he's still tricking me,

because I'm his...

I'm his f***ing puppet.

Very good, Amy.

Aka Manah literally means,

"evil mind."

Listen...

I'm gonna give you my card.

You give me a call...

when you need to hear

a friendly voice.

Or if you just need somebody

to remind you...

what's real.

Rap at you later, sister.

[groans]

You know what?

You're all right.

You are all right.

Not so bad yourself.

You know, I was thinking...

'cause you're a cool cat,

and I'm obviously a cool cat,

maybe we could get

your purty lady,

and I could find

a purty lady of my own.

And we could explore

this here manor.

And, I don't know, just happen

to stumble into my room,

and polish off

these beers, and...

get to know each other

a little better.

So, sister,

how are things with Amy?

She killed her damn husband because she

thought he was some sort of sex demon.

Well, apparently,

I need to get some fresh air.

[electronic music playing]

Ma'am, when I first saw you,

you reminded me

of a beautiful spring day.

[laughs]

And I have been trying to get you alone for just

one moment, from the minute we locked eyes.

Oh, my goodness.

[in southern accent]

Well, Darsaw, I do declare,

you... flatter.

Well, if you are a kind woman,

you'd put me out of my misery,

by allowing me

your fair company, ma'am.

I would just completely

stay away from that guy, Ole.

Thank you

for looking out for me.

It's sweet.

Yeah.

And I like you a lot.

And I want you.

You... You're my cousin.

Yeah... I'm adopted.

[Blair] Want some?

This is the prettiest thing

I've ever seen.

I know.

I love sunsets.

I wasn't talking about

the sunset.

I was looking at you.

Oh...

Thank you.

I knew there was a sweetie

underneath all that flannel.

Well, that's very nice

of you to say,

but now that I think of it,

it really is a very beautiful

place they got here, ain't it?

It's funny, because I just really, really

didn't want to come here this time.

But now that I'm here,

I kind of like it.

You know, it's nice.

Quiet.

And, I haven't had the urge

to check my phone

ever since somebody

walked through the door.

Well, you know, it's kind of

like the great scholars say,

"Less is, in fact, more."

I like that.

Well, you know, the manor does kind

of have its own unique charm to it.

Yeah. [laughs]

Yeah, I like wandering around and looking

at all the weird little trinkets.

Yep...

the accommodations

ain't bad, either.

- The rooms are kind of nice.

- Yeah.

Mine's pretty cozy.

Oh yeah?

Mine ain't too shabby, either.

Oh, is that right?

I wonder if the, uh, layouts

are the same?

- The couch is in the same spots...

- Yeah.

...and the lamps.

I wonder. I'm so curious.

Say, I'll tell you what...

if you show me yours,

I'll show you mine.

I can roll with that.

[thunder]

[Amy screams]

Oh my God!

What the f***?

[suspenseful music playing]

[Amy sobbing]

When I first saw you,

it was like a spring day.

I'd appreciate the pleasure

of your company.

No!

- Quiet, quiet, quiet!

- Stop! Stop it!

No! No! No!

- Quiet! Quiet!

- [Amy screaming]

- [Amy screams]

- [high pitch slashing]

[Amy sobbing]

- Amy?

- What is that?Amy, honey, what's going...?

[grunts]

Amy? Amy? Amy, it's Mom.

Amy, it's Mom. It's Mom.

[suspenseful music continues]

[no audible dialogue]

[Amy shrieks]

[grunts]

Hey, Mom...

Mom, I need my meds.

Okay, okay. We'll get you them.

Okay. It's okay, I've got you.

I've got you.

Come on, it's just you and me.

It's just you and me. Come on.

We'll go to bed.

Remember, it's just you and me.

[exhales]

[Young Niklaus]

Am I like a king, Father?

You are but a lonely pawn,

my son.

A pawn? I don't understand.

Well...

each piece is different.

Each one has

a different role to play.

They're unique.

Some people say that one piece may

be more powerful than another...

or have a higher rank,

but I disagree.

Each piece is as powerful,

or as weak,

as the circumstance

it finds itself in.

At the beginning of the game,

they are all equal

and depending on

the strategy used,

the positioning,

the circumstances of the play,

any piece could be the weakest.

Or any piece

could be the most powerful.

[opera music playing]

[music fades out]

[dramatic music playing]

[car engine starts]

[sinister music playing]

I like your hat.

Really?

Give it to me.

You want it?

Mm-hm.

All right.

[chuckles]

- You know what?

- Hm?

It looks better on you.

- [laughs]

- It really does.

You know, um...

I have a surprise for you.

Turn around.

[low-tempo r&b music playing]

Close your eyes.

I won't look.

Maybe get started

on that belt buckle for me, huh?

Don't gotta tell me twice.

[suspenseful music playing]

[woman]

Doctor, I have Amy for you.

Thank you.

Hello, Amy.

[exhales]

Well,

it's your last day with us.

Yeah.

How do you feel about that?

Um, a little scared.

Four years is...

a long time

to be away from everyone.

I feel like I've changed a lot.

I'm hoping outside

has changed, too.

You have. It has.

We've all come a very long way,

you especially.

Thank you.

We've made fantastic progress.

Although, there have been

some incidents.

And the nightmares.

Are you still having

the nightmares?

- Um...

- The demon?

Aka Manah.

[groaning]

[loud eerie sounds]

[electrical crackling]

[eerie sounds]

[eerie sounds stop]

[knock on door]

What is it?

[woman]

Doctor, Mrs. Hunter is here.

Could you tell her

we'll be with her in a moment?

Yes, Doctor.

Amy...

I'd like for you to consider remaining

in some programs here at Fairview.

I have to be frank with you,

I am worried that your episodes

may turn dangerous

if you are not

in a controlled environment.

I have to stay here?

No. No, no.

No one is trying

to force you to stay here.

I am simply talking about

a day treatment program.

No.

God, if I don't have to...

and I mean, have to stay here...

I'd really like to go back.

Oh my God.

I had no idea

it had gotten so bad.

Oh, I'm sorry, honey. Do you not

remember about Dave's funeral?

What a horrible thing to say,

Ethan.

Yeah,

it's the concussion talking.

Oh.

Oh, are we okay?

The pills should put her out

for the night..

Janie, it's a heartbreak.

I don't think I could do it.

Jane, you've got

the patience of a saint.

So, the girl...

She'll be asleep soon.

Good, good. Sleep is good.

To wit, if there's nothing else,

I would like to retire.

Thank you so much

for everything, Nik.

You're a prince.

And you're a very nice lady.

So, breakfast in the morning,

seven to nine?

Goodnight, everybody.

[opera music playing]

Here... is just a white pawn,

right?

No.

Just a white pawn

until he becomes,

the white pawn.

And he clashes.

I am the white pawn

Clash, clash

I am the white pawn

I am the white pawn

Clash, clash

I am the white pawn

I am the white pawn

Clash, clash

I am the white pawn

I shall raise my sword

In defense of my queen

Clash, clash

I am the white pawn

Clash, clash

I am the white pawn

I shall raise my shield

To protect my king

Clash, clash

I am the white pawn

Clash, clash

I am the white pawn

I shall die honorably in battle

I will, clash, clash

I am the white pawn

Clash, clash

I am the white pawn

I'll be the first to die

If to die I must, clash, clash

I am the white pawn

Clash, clash

I am the white pawn

I am the white pawn,

clash, clash.

That chess set has

always creeped me out, Ethan.

Well, maybe that's

what I like about it, Jane.

[sighs]

I'm going out to the gazebo.

To get stoned.

Yeah, to get stoned.

What the hell?

Why don't you have

another f***ing drink, Eva?

[sighs] I'll be right back.

I thought he'd never leave.

Hey, be happy that you have

someone to annoy you.

Like I need a hole in the head.

All right.

No, I shouldn't. Amy's a mess.

That's an argument for,

not against.

Go on.

My God, Eva, keep drinking.

Just drink yourself

to death, please.

[grunts]

[exhales]

Yeah.

Oh.

F***ing animals.

God, I hate this place.

I need to piss.

[unzips zipper]

- Eva...

- [urine splashes]

Come here.

I got something for you.

[drunken humming]

I think I'll join you, son.

- [unzips zipper]

- [urine splashes]

Who are you?

[urine continues]

Ah.

[zips up zipper]

[blows into hands]

[door creaks]

[grunts]

[groans]

[crunching, tearing sound]

- [zips up zipper]

- Have a good night, son.

[drunken humming]

[Brett singing]

I've been waiting for so long

Time again

Time and time again

It's when I want you so bad

I mean, especially at my age,

I mean...

Who the hell is that

at this time of night?

- What?

- What?

Ladies.

[chuckles]

I'm sorry,

I hope I didn't startle you.

Evening, ma'am.

I got a car downstairs that's

full of buckshot and water,

and some deer piss.

And, well, I need my brothers to help

me unload it into the pickup truck,

but, uh, they don't seem

to be answering their god...

Their phones. Um...

So, without sounding rude, um...

have y'all seen my dumbass

brothers anywhere?

We haven't seen them

since dinner with you.

Would you like some wine?

Hm.

Yes.

Nah, I'd better not.

Uh, I... I'm gonna go upstairs

and check to see where Tweedledee

and Tweedledumbass are,

but y'all ladies

have a good evening,

and maybe a raincheck,

or something like that.

I'll wait. It's all right.

[laughs]

Yes, thank you very much.

I used to spend my nights out

In the barroom

Brought me back

From being too far gone

[sighs]

[both laughing]

- Oh, sh*t.

- What?

Where the f*** is Blair?

Sh*t. Sh*t, that f***ing hick.

Darsaw!

Goddamn numbhead.

F***ing stupid asses.

Darsaw!

Ole!

The f*** you at, man?

Goobers!

You guys better stop...

f***ing around.

She didn't even unpack.

That's not like her.

Okay, then he put his hand

up my skirt and he yelled...

Here, come here.

[indistinct whisper]

[both laughing]

What the f***

does that even mean?

I have no f***ing idea,

but whenever he did it,

I just nearly came.

- Our baby!

- Hey.

- Hey, so beautiful and grown.

- Hey.

Why are you out of bed?

You feeling better?

Yeah, Mom, have you seen Blair

come through here at all?

- No, not since dinner, why?- Yeah, why?

Um...

Because she has

my cell phone charger,

and, uh, my-my battery's dead.

There's no network out here,

and I'm dying, so...

- Well, I would check upstairs...

- Yes.

- ...or the local nightclubs.

- Definitely.

- Did you see your dad out there?

- Nope. No, Ma.

Come on, Amy. Gotta go. Okay.

Mmm, it's just like

when we were kids.

Um-hm.

- Do you have any more wine?

- Um-hm.

[laughs]

[swing music playing]

[no audible dialogue]

[eerie music playing]

[Amy] Blair!

[Trevor] Blair, what the f***?

Blair!

[Amy] Blair!

- This is, this is...

- [dialing phone]

[phone ringing]

[phone continues ringing]

She-she's not answering

her phone.

Well, sh*t...

I thought we would have caught

her bawling her brains out

in some redneck threesome

free-for-all.

- No such luck, huh?

- No. No luck.

I-I think we better get

the 'rents involved.

One... One of those cult freaks

could've made off with her,

or she could've hitched a ride

with that cotton candy vendor.

I think he... was cute.

I think the True Believers

were good.

- I mean, they were nice people.

- [chuckles]

Yeah, oh, they're nice.

Yeah, that's how they get you

to join their cult.

Next thing you know,

you're shaving your head

and your selling flowers

at a f***ing airport. Come on.

[door creeks]

[sobs]

[bones cracking]

Amy, take your time.

And don't be in a hurry to take

your finger off of the piece.

Okay,

I think I got it this time.

So, make your move.

Bishop to queen's bishop three.

- Check.

- Very good.

You know, I can still take

your bishop with my rook.

Maybe.

Okay then...

rook takes bishop.

Queen to queen's knight five.

- Checkmate.

- [laughs]

Oh, son of a b*tch, Amy.

I finally got you.

Three moves ahead.

Nicely done.

Thanks.

[sobbing]

[sinister music crescendos]

- [gasps]

- Sorry.

I didn't mean to startle you,

just looking for my brothers.

- Have you seen them?

- Um-mm.

I'm sorry.

I just took a nap and woke up.

And these two here got

stone f***ing drunk. -Mom?

God...

We need to find Trevor.

All right, I'll come with you.

I've got a flashlight in the car.

[suspenseful music playing]

[both] Ole!

[Brett] God damn it.

Darsaw!

Oh my God.

Is that real?

Man, that's f***ing real.

[dialing phone]

[phone ringing]

[operator tone]

- We're sorry...

- What the f***?

...you have reached a number that has

been disconnected... -You kidding me?

F***!

I remember seeing

a landline inside, all right?

Come on,

let's go see if that one works.

Come on.

[suspenseful music continues]

God damn it, Darsaw.

Come on, we need to go find

"Thelma and Louise."

[sobbing]

Go see if you can find the

phone somewhere. -Okay.

I think I see it over there

near the window.

Ma'am? Ma'am, wake up.

Ma'am, please.

Ma'am?

Ma'am? [screams]

Call 911, Amy!

Call the police!

[sobbing]

The phone, is it working or not?

[indistinct,

hysterical shouting]

F***!

[screams]

Stop! Stop!

[sobbing]

[sinister music playing]

[opera music playing]

Ah.

The omnipotent, noble knight.

[galloping sound]

I shall mount

my mighty barbed steed

and take great lengths

upon this land,

paired with my bishop

in defense.

Serve upon this war, its end.

[electrical crackling]

Happy birthday.

- Make a wish.

- [sobbing]

I wish this would end.

Where's my mom?

Why, right there, of course.

Who's that?

Where's my mom? Where's she?

Follow the bread crumbs.

[sinister music playing]

[grunting]

[screams]

[opera music playing]

Now, the bishop...

a wily soldier,

but an honorable man.

And I shall preach

the good word, sire,

and bring our enemies

to God's fire.

Pray for their souls

upon the hour

as death's dragon doth devour.

[sobbing]

[dramatic music playing]

[opera music playing]

The kingdom, Niklaus,

the kingdom.

You must defend the kingdom.

- The kingdom?

- The kingdom.

These pieces, these soldiers...

They're your only defense

of the kingdom.

- The kingdom.

- The kingdom.

- The kingdom.

- The kingdom.

The kingdom.

The kingdom.

[Amy sobbing]

[ominous music playing]

[eerie sounds]

[electrical crackling]

Mama! Oh, my God!

I'm so sorry. Okay, Mom.

- Hello, Amy.

- No!

- Did you like my gift?

- Let my mom go!

Yeah, about that...

Jane, we're not going

to be needing you anymore.

No, I'm sorry,

the king has sacrificed you

so that we could put

our queen back on the board.

No.

Happy birthday to you

Happy birthday to you

Happy birthday, dear daughter

Stop!

Oh, Amy, you're being silly.

Yes, yes. Do you not understand?

I'm your daddy. It's true.

Your mother was my cousin,

the beautiful Elizabeth Rosen.

- No!

- Listen to me,

I knew the moment I saw you,

that you were my Amy Anders.

My father made us give you up.

But now you're back.

Now we can win.

You're Aka Manah.

- You killed them all.

- Amy...

They were just game pieces.

This is the game of kings.

Do you not understand?

You killed Trevor.

No, not true.

That was your demon.

He made me.

I was just his puppet, and you know

exactly what I'm talking about.

And you know what else?

He's gonna make you do it, too.

No.

Amy, Amy, Amy...

Listen to me very carefully...

You're not my father!

You are a beautiful

monarch butterfly...

[electrical crackling]

...emerging from the cocoon.

Preparing to take flight...

and be free.

Queen to queen's knight three.

Remove now, the black queen

from the board.

Good daughter.

Now, come here...

and give Papa a big hug.

[pop music playing]

[music fades out]

Hello, Reverend Thomas.

It's Amy Anders.

It's actually Anders now.

My mom left me here to recover, and Nik

had to leave town for a little while

and take care of family

down south.

And he left me in charge, and...

[grunting, gasping]

I thought, you know, we could

use a lot of help around here,

and maybe we could

work something out?

[ominous music playing]

Great.

I look forward to it.
