No. No no!

No, Trevor!

Trevor, baby, no.

Hello?

Is someone there?

Is someone in there?

Is there someone

alive in there?

Hey.

Are you okay?

Are you okay?

I'm gonna get you

out of there.

Hold on!

What does it mean

to be happy?

To be content

in the world around you?

Mom used to say

it was family-

That family is the heart

of everything, even existence.

Without it, there's nothing.

She would always have

these simple answers

that somehow would sound

so brilliant.

And then she died.

My father died

along with her.

Shortly after that, my brother David

had to sell the farm

where we grew up.

Now we're just trying to be

an ordinary family,

trying to figure out

where we fit in in the world.

And for me,

I'm trying to figure out

where I belong,

right now

in this exact moment.

I don't know, Dad.

What do you think about the black hair?

Come on, it's different.

- It's different than normal.

- It's pretty, don't you think?

Oh, yes.

Yes yes, definitely-

right there, right there.

Look at the baby,

he's part of the family.

- Hey, there we go.

- Okay, Dad.

I don't wanna hear that,

Darlene.

The social worker

will be here tomorrow.

We can't have the place

looking like this.

- Whatever you say, Dad.

- That's not funny, Darlene.

Okay, I'm trying to do

the best I can here.

Oh, Jesus. You know, I'm not

a little girl anymore

and you don't have to be

a dick about this!

Just- can you just please

clean your room

and maybe not wear that mess

on your eyes tomorrow?

F*** you, David!

Francis, turn it off now!

Oh, come on, David,

it's a school project.

- Just not our personal stuff, okay?

- It's about our family.

- I need this kind of stuff.

- Turn it off now!

You just get the heck

out of my face for a second.

My brother David

is the oldest.

He picked up all the responsibilities

after Mom and Dad died.

We used to be real close,

but after he sold our farm

something changed in him.

He became like one of those life-sized

cardboard cutouts you see in the stores,

trying to sell the idea

that everything is perfect,

but really nothing

is the same anymore.

We just keep moving

from town to town

running from the truth,

waiting for it to one day

catch up with us.

This is our sixth house

in two years.

Oh, yeah,

every single one of them.

Wow, that's cool.

Okay, guys,

I'm gonna go pee.

- No, wait.

- I gotta go. No, come on.

- Sam, stay.

- I'm gonna go. I'll be right back.

- Don't take too long.

- I won't.

Sam, get your ass in here

and smoke a joint.

It's beautiful. Come on,

do the rain dance.

Hell, no! Get in the car

right now, girl.

Come on. No!

- Yeah! Ow! Get in here.

- Come on!

Back in.

So, did you guys have fun?

- Yeah.

- You are glowing.

No, I'm not.

So, Wendell,

what do you do?

I work for my brother-

fetch stuff for him,

things like that.

- Nothing too exciting though.

- Sounds cool.

So where are you guys off

to next, huh?

Seattle, I think.

We're just gonna keep traveling

city to city

till we run all out of money.

- Can't beat that kind of freedom.

- No, we just picked up and left!

No one even knows

where we're at.

- What?

- Hush.

We don't have to worry

about Wendell, our hero.

Wendell is Superman.

Wow, look at that.

Look at all

those pretty stars.

- Where?

- I think you mean raindrops.

You can at least pretend

to like it, okay?

Hey, I'm sorry for yelling

at you yesterday.

I didn't mean to.

We're good?

Yeah, we're good. But, David,

I'm really not feeling too hot today.

- You're going to school, okay?

- I just don't think-

I don't wanna hear it.

You're going to school.

Good morning, sleepyhead.

You want some breakfast?

Why do you even bother?

Because that's what families do.

They have breakfast together.

Cute, David. Anyway, Kitty's

spending the night tomorrow.

- Who's uh-

- I am telling you in advance,

- just like you asked.

- Who the heck is Kitty?

I don't know,

some chick from Ohio.

All right. Remember, social worker

is coming tonight at 5:00 for dinner.

You should really try

giving up cooking, David.

I'm off,

and you go to school.

I really don't fit in there.

Look,

I know it's hard for you,

but can you please

at least try?

Why? It's not my fault

we're always moving.

You're right, Francis.

It's my fault.

I'm sorry, guys.

I know I have a bad temper.

What do you want me to do?

Some maybe say I'm bipolar.

Good morning, Francis.

How are you doing there, bud, huh?

What are you reading?

"Gay sperm donors needed

for lesbian couple. "

- Knock it off.

- You're calling that today.

- Have you fed Lenny?

- Don't look at me. Look at Franny.

Oh, come on, I just did it

two days ago.

Okay, I gotta go to work.

- Will you just please do it?

- I'll do it before I go to school.

Where're you going? Oh, yeah, you gotta

go do your thing. Forgot, sorry.

Have fun.

Have a good day.

The twins- they've always

been distant from the family.

Wendell is the main reason

why we move a lot.

He just got out of jail for biting

some guy's ear off

at a Cheesy Chuck's Pizza parlor

up north.

Darlene is just as mean,

but more refined.

Like when we were kids,

she used to lock me in the closet

just to hear me scream.

Then, hours later,

she would let me out pretending

she was the one who saved me.

And I always fell for it.

Let me out of here!

Help, please!

Please.

Somebody please help us!

Oh, heck no, we've had a lot

of social workers come here,

but you're the first

for dinner.

So, Francis, what's up

with you tonight, huh?

- Nothing.

- Anything you wanna talk about?

Anything at all? School maybe?

I don't know...

Well, you know, if there is,

you just jump on in, all right?

Yeah, he told me he wasn't

feeling too well this morning.

Oh, I'm sorry.

Oh, thank you, Darlene.

That's, uh... quite a creative look

you've got going there,

young lady.

- What do you call that, huh?

- Death.

Ah, death. That's cute.

So tell me, David,

are you and Wendell

still working over there

at Del Rancho?

I don't know if I could work

at a slaughterhouse, huh?

Yeah, well, my father

owned a farm

when we were younger

and he did the same thing,

so I guess it just

came naturally.

Well...

so, like, what do they have you

doing over there?

I mean...

you don't have to kill the animals

and all that stuff, do you, David?

Heavens, no.

No no, I'm a carver.

I take out the organs,

prep them, stuff like that.

Yes, David has a real knack

for gutting the life out of things.

Thank you, Darlene.

So... too bad there's not-

not a demand

on the black market for cow parts.

You would be a rich man

by now.

Not at the table,

please, Francis.

I apologize. Paul, he's been

following us around with that thing

for the past few days-

some sort of school project

- or something or other.

- No, that's fine with me.

I think it's kind of cool.

Francis, tell me about the project.

Well, it's uh-

I'm supposed to write

a report about my family-
our family-

and I just asked if I could

shoot a video instead.

Good. Now, that's a good idea.

That is a great idea.

- I hated doing papers. I hated it.

- Me too.

I really did.

- Hey, gang.

- Hey, Wendell.

- Hey.

- How are you?

- Good, Paul. How are you?

- Good, thanks.

Am I late?

What do you think,

Wendell?

David,

may I please be excused?

- We're not finished eating.

- No no no, let the boy go.

- Mm-hmm.

- He's probably bored out of his mind.

- Where are you going, Francis?

- I used to have two younger brothers,

so I understand these things.

They are a handful.

That was great, you guys.

Thanks a lot.

I know I'm not much

of a cook, but I do try.

Not to worry. You probably never

tasted my wife's cooking, huh?

Well, I'll be in the kitchen

cleaning.

Did you hear that?

Oh, it's probably cats...

f***ing.

Yep, that's cats

f***ing, all right-

getting after it.

What do you think, David?

Who'd have thought?

- Listen, that was a great dinner.

- Thank you.

- I'll talk to you soon.

- Thanks. Yeah.

- Thanks, David.

- Good night, Paul.

Good night.

Need more padding on that south wall.

You can hear 'em upstairs.

All right, so you're sure

that they're good?

Positive. On a road trip,

it's gonna be two, three weeks

before anyone notices.

- Healthy?

- Oh, yeah.

- I even took one for a test drive.

- Quit acting up, okay?

I don't want their faces showing up

on the 10:
00 news like last time.

- This could sustain us for awhile.

- Trust me.

All right.

Let's get to work.

- Help.

- Room service.

How are we holding up, girls?

Good?

Well, you're

looking good. Hi.

I hope this doesn't change

anything between us.

Wendell, what did I tell you?

Come on, sweetheart.

- Stop it!

- Come on.

Get up.

Oh, yeah!

Don't worry, Sam.

I still got something

right here, okay?

All right, let's

get you up, huh?

You're a live one,

aren't you?

Let's tie you down here.

Let's get you down here.

Is that too tight, sweetie?

- Sounds like he's changing.

- Hey. Hey, Lenny.

Poor guy's

probably hungry.

We'll feed him later.

Just go keep watch.

I'm gonna tuck you in

later, okay?

I got you.

Get in. I'll give you

a ride to school.

I saw some stuff

I want to shoot, Wendell.

Just get the f*** in.

God damn.

You gotta pop your cherry,

baby brother.

Huh?

So you can quit moping around,

playing with that camera.

Hey! Hey.

What, are you too good

to talk to me now?

- F*** you, Wendell!

- What?!

- What the- hey! Hey!

- F*** you!

- Keep it up, Francis!

- No!

Keep it up! We take care

of your sorry ass, all right?

We feed you, we put f***ing clothes

on your back,

and you do nothing in return

but complain.

Let go of me!

Dude, I- look,

I know it f***ing seems

f***ed up, all right?

But we do what we do

to survive.

All right?

You do anything to f*** up

our family- most importantly me-

I'll f***ing kill you, okay?

Hey! Okay?

Get the f*** out of my truck.

Shut the f*** up

before I gut you myself!

Bye, Lenny.

Hello?

Anybody home?

Yes, hello.

This is David Hamilton.

I'm calling on behalf

of Francis Hamilton.

Yes yes. Yeah,

he's not feeling too well,

got a case of the flu

or something.

Yeah, right right.

Oh, thank you,

I appreciate it.

Have a great day. Bye.

Please don't hurt her

anymore.

I'm not like them.

Then can you help us,

please?

I'm sorry, but I can't.

- Please.

- I don't even have a key.

Do something, please.

I can give you

something to drink.

Do you want

something to drink?

She needs some, please.

I don't have a key.

She just needs water.

She's dying.

I have to go.

Someone will be here soon.

Please.

The top drawer, eh?

You need a fake ID?

Where did you get all those?

I know a guy in the city.

You want one?

I won't charge you.

Yeah.

Let's see.

DRIVER LICENSE:

Here we go- Dani Cummings.

Oh, look she's an organ donor.

How sweet!

Seems about your height...

- Blonde hair.

- That's okay.

What are you little girls doing?

We are just getting comfortable

and throwing in a flick.

You wanna watch?

I'd love to watch.

Where were you, Francis?

I was just down by the river

filming some stuff.

Pretty late, huh?

Yeah, I guess.

Well, I'm going out

for a little bit.

So if you need anything...

All right.

All right. I'll see you later.

Turn it off, turn it off!

It's just a movie, sweetheart.

I thought you liked

this kind of stuff.

Well, I do.

It's just these movies

are too real sometimes.

Kitty, if monsters were real,

they'd be a lot different

than they are on TV.

Well, I just can't stand

being scared.

Well, what do you

wanna do now?

Let's play a game.

What kind of game?

Let's play truth or dare.

What?

Around here we only play

dare or double dare,

if you can handle it.

- What about truth?

- No truth.

Dares just keep doubling

until someone gets hurt.

- Play nice, Wendell.

- I am.

Okay, Kitty,

you can even go first.

All right.

- Dare or double dare?

- Me?

If you can handle it.

Dare.

I dare you...

to finish your beer

in one drink.

Okay, my turn.

Kitty,

dare or double dare?

Double dare.

Double dare?

I double dare you...

to...

make out with Darlene.

You think I won't?

Well, if you don't,

you lose.

I mean, we could play Scrabble

or something, if you want.

Not bad.

- You surprise me.

- I'm full of them.

Aren't we all?

Okay, Kitty.

It's your turn again.

All right, Darlene...

- dare or double dare?

- Triple dare.

- Triple dare? Come on-

- Triple dare.

Okay...

I triple dare you and Wendell

to make out.

Huh?

Make out with her?

You are a-

just a kinky little thing,

aren't you?

I win.

I don't think so.

Come on in.

- Nice house.

- Thank you.

- And the flowers-

- Yeah.

This is the sort

of fall foliage...

Oh, yeah.

This is the wood-

woodland room.

This is nice.

I like that frame right there.

- Thank you, thank you.

- Very nice work.

Thank you.

I picked it out myself.

Very nicely hung.

We really shouldn't be here.

- Why is that?

- Just-

get in trouble.

We could go to your room

and be quiet.

I don't know, it's kind of-

Come on.

- Okay.

- Okay?

Okay. Just, we gotta be

really quiet, okay?

Okay.

No. No!

No!

No!

Help!

So, sure you

don't want some?

I'm buying.

Pretty good!

No, I'm fine,

thank you.

So...

what did you want

to talk about?

It uh- you know, something

at school? Something?

My f***ing family, just-

I'm sorry?

Yeah, Paul, it's school and stuff,

you know?

- Yeah.

- Teachers and stuff, you know?

You know, I don't know if I ever

told you about this, but-

my dad, when he was

an army captain and-

we moved from base to base,

it seemed like-

Christ, every-

every year or so.

So I know what

it's like to be-

Francis.

Hey, I'm over here, pal.

Yo, Francis, I'm over here.

Francis.

I'm gonna go, Paul.

I have homework and stuff,

you know?

- Just-

- All right.

Well, I'Il-

I'll stop by in a couple of days

and I'Il-

I'll check up on you, all right?
Here. There you go.

- Thanks.

- You're all right?

Yeah.

- Okay.

- Thanks for the soda.

Sure.

You take care, pal.

Wendell, what the f***

are you doing?

Oh, hey, Francis.

I didn't know you had

a girlfriend.

Seems really nice, huh?

I saw your little movie too-

creepy.

This is a lot of fun,

a lot of fun.

You don't mind sharing

with the family, do you?

You know, I gotta hand it

to you, brother,

you're a lot more like us

than I thought, aren't you?

She's pretty good-looking too.

You know, I had

this good idea though.

I was thinking that we-

oh, yeah, look at that.

Look at that.

We could make our own porn movies

down here if we want.

B*tch, huh?

How do you like that?

Huh, Francis?

Huh? Come on, brother,

let's see what you got.

Let's see what you got-

oh, yeah! You f***!

Come on, bud. Come on, big guy.

Is that all you got?

Is that all you got?

That's what I thought, b*tch.

Hey, Sam, how about your little hero

now, huh? Huh?

- F***!

- No!

- Get over here! Come on.

- Wendell.

You f***ing b*tch! Huh? You wanna

show off for that f***ing b*tch?

Huh? I'll let you.

Come on, Lenny, come and get it!

Come on, Lenny.

Check it out.

You like that feeling, b*tch?

Come on.

Hey. Hey, Sam, keep it up.

You keep putting sh*t in his head,

I'm gonna skin you both

alive, all right?

- Please.

- What was that?

Excuse me?

I'm sorry, I don't think

I heard you right.

What was that? Huh?

What was that?

Okay, I'll tell you what,

why don't you hang out here

for awhile?

I'll come back down and we'll finish

what we started, okay?

You can scream

all you want, Sam.

Just know one thing:

I am going to kill you.

All right?

What are you doing

here, Francis?

- We need to talk.

- What happened to your hand?

Wendell.

I'm working here, Francis.

You know, you can't come running to me

- every time you two have a fight.

- Yeah, but-

I'm getting awfully tired

of your hullabaloo, okay?

Wendell, school...

I can't be with you

24 hours a day, bud.

I have no one else

to talk to, David.

I'm working a double shift

here, okay?

Don't you think it's time you started

trying to handle your own problems?

What would you do, huh?

What do you want me to say?

God.

Man,

I just wish Mom and Dad

were still-

They're dead, Francis, okay?

When are you gonna-

when are you gonna

understand that?

Just go home, okay?

We'll talk about this later.

No. You know what?

F*** you, David!

F*** you!

I don't need your help.

Don't even f***ing worry

about it.

Hey, Wendell.

Is Darlene home?

She's in her room.

So, what are you doing tonight?

You know I'm spending

the night again.

Darlene?

Hey.

- Is she here?

- No.

I meant, she's coming back

in a bit.

No one's here,

it's just you and me.

Okay, well, I'll just

come back later then.

Why not stay

and wait here, huh?

I should probably

just come back.

Really?

Yeah.

What's the rush?

Anyone ever tell you

you smell absolutely delicious?

Huh?

I bet you taste even better.

- Hey.

- Hi, guys.

I guess you're spending

the night, Kitty?

Yeah.

Come on.

What was that?

He's so weird.

You keep telling yourself

that things will change...

that it's all a bad dream

and one day you'll wake up.

I just wish they would catch us

and then it would be all over.

Stay away from me.

I'm not going to hurt you.

You killed my friend.

I brought you some food.

It's all I could afford.

Is that a joke?

Just go away.

Don't worry.

It's just Lenny.

What's Lenny?

You wouldn't believe me

if I told you.

You kill people and you feed it

to something you call Lenny?

We're not like you, okay?

We're sick. We have

a f***ing disease.

Yeah, you're sick.

You are.

I should go.

Wait.

Can I have some

of that food, please?

It's just-

they'd kill me if they knew

I was here.

- This is looking good.

- Which color are you using?

- This one in here.

- I like it.

Yeah. Okay.

Okay, get you doing this.

I'm just not good at it.

No, just need

a little practice.

Thank you.

What's your name?

Francis.

Can I ask you

something, Francis?

Why did you

bring me food?

Because...

I'm not one of them.

They're gonna

kill me, Francis.

I know.

All you have to do

is call the police.

Please.

My family has money.

They'll give you

anything you need.

You don't understand.

I can't.

Yes, you can.

Yes, you can!

Francis, I have people

who love me, who need me.

I just want to go home.

I want to see my family.

And what about my family?

They're all I have.

They're killers, Francis.

They're not a family.

I can't survive-

can't survive

without them.

Sh*t.

Hello?

Wendell, are you

messing with me?

Oh my God, you scared

the sh*t out of me!

Really? What happened?

Let me see.

- Oh my God.

- Can I kiss it and make it better?

I'll just clean it off

in the bathroom.

- Oh, that's a lot of blood.

- Yeah..

- Let me help you.

- Darlene, come on.

Hey, Wendell.

Hey. That's a nasty cut.

Yeah. Wendell, was that you

f***ing with me out in the hall?

- Not me. Must've been Darlene.

- Oh, tell the truth, Wendell.

- Truth or dare?

- Ooh, you up for another game, Kitty?

- Can I go first?

- Be my guest.

- Okay. Darlene, dare or double dare?

- Yeah? I don't know,

I'm feeling a little frisky tonight.

How about a double dare to start?

- I double dare you-

- What the hell-?

- to give Kitty a little

seductive dance.

Darlene?

You guys, stop.

Darlene, why are you

doing this?

Stop!

Darlene, stop!

Double dare

or triple dare, Kitty?

I triple dare you to let Wendell

kiss you on the lips.

Here, Kitty Kitty.

Come on, pussycat.

Where are you going, babe?

Where are you going, p*ssy?

Here, Kitty, Kitty,

Kitty, Kitty.

I don't want

to talk to you in there.

We're not done

with our game yet.

How long have I been out?

Not long-

hour or two.

Somebody will be here soon.

I should go.

Francis...

Thank you for talking to me.

I'm sorry, but...

I-

I can help you out there.

I can help you

without your family.

You don't need them,

Francis.

I'll take care of you.

I'll take care of you.

Please, don't kill me.

You're leaving me here

to die.

I know.

Hey, Dad, over here.

Did you know your redwood

is in violation

of the neighborhood safety

growth code?

- No.

- Uh-huh.

That's a good job, son.

Hi, I'm Larry Davies.

I'm- I'm Katherine-

Kitty's uncle.

- Kitty is a friend of Darlene's.

- Yeah, sure.

Yeah. This is my son, Allen.

Lieutenant Commander Daniels,

private sector.

David Hamilton.

Just for your information,

Kitty's gonna be staying with us

this college semester.

So if you see her around, that's why.

Is everything all right?

Yeah. Look, I'm sure

it's nothing.

We're just a little worried, that's all.

We haven't heard from her all day

and she isn't answering

her cell phone.

Is she here, by chance?

Unfortunately, no one's here.

Darlene doesn't have

a cell phone-

brain tumors.

That's strange, you know?

It's just not like her.
She said she was gonna be spending

the night here last night with Darlene,

and she knew we had plans

for this morning.

I put a couple of calls in

to some friends of mine

down at the local sheriff's office,

just in case.

But if you hear from her,

please call that number.

Of course, of course.

Hey, look, I-

I know we are bothering you

and all that,

but we didn't have

your number.

So we just thought

we'd pop by and check.

So, if something turns up-

Just let me know

if there's anything I can do.

Take care.

What did you do?

Why, nothing, David.

She left here this morning.

We really haven't seen her since.

I can't believe

you two did this!

Oh, and what

about the dozen homos

you have buried

under the house?

Yeah, Mr. Perfect,

how do you explain that?

Are you that blind in your

make-believe world,

you don't think we know?

I use my head!

I pick transients

and drifters,

not some neighborhood girl

whose cousin or-

or brother or whatever

is the police!

You know why you hate us

so much, David?

It's because

we represent everything

you wish you could have,

but are just too afraid

to face.

You two always-

f*** it up!

Are you trying

to scare us, David,

like when we were kids?

We're not little kids anymore.

So what are you

gonna do, David?

When are you gonna realize

this isn't the first time

and certainly not the last time

it's gonna happen?

Pull it together.

Hey!

- Mom and Dad-

- Mom and Dad were the exception.

None of us have the kind

of self-control to have what they did.

The only difference

between you and us, David,

is we don't look at ourselves

in the mirror and lie.

We accept who we are.

We don't deny it.

We have to move again.

All right, pack up

what we need-

- Hi, this is Paul.

- Hey, Paul-

Please leave your message

at the sound of the tone.

Don't forget to leave

your phone number. Bye.

Paul, it's Francis.

There's something really important

we gotta talk about

about my family

and um...

I can't- I can't do it

over the phone.

If you could meet me in person,

that'd be great.

I- I-I just-

f***!

I don't know

what I'm gonna do.

I know, Lenny.

I know.

It's coming.

It's coming, Lenny!

Please sit still.

Actually, it's-

it's kind of funny.

My father taught me

how to do this.

It's kooky, I know,

I know.

He just wanted to make sure

if something were to happen to him,

we'd still survive.

Now you gotta get it

just right, so no air gets in.

It has a longer shelf life

that way.

It's kind of like...

frozen food.

You have something

on your face there.

Oh, I apologize,

I don't mean to make you

self-conscious or anything.

"David," he said,

"David-

David, one day

you might have to be

the man of this family.

David...

David," he said-

he said, "David,

you might have to be

the one that takes care

of your brothers

and your sister. "

And I do, I do,

but they don't care.

Do you think they appreciate

what I do for them?

No no no no.

Look, missy,

I don't mean to be a rude c*nt,

but it sort of seems to me

that you're not listening

to me.

I just want

what's best for them.

I just want what's

best for them.

I just want

what's best for them.

Goodbye, Lenny.

Francis?

Hey, Francis,

I got your message.

Francis?

David, are you here?

Francis?

Francis?

Francis, is that you?

Francis, you out here?

Hello?

David? David?

Da-

David?

David?

Hello?

David, are you all right?

Hey, I'll try to get you out.

Here, listen, I'm gonna-

sh*t.

You hiding there, huh?

Are you all right?

Hi. Everything's going to be okay.

Stop it, stop-

What are you doing?

What are you doing?!

- Ah, no!

- No, Lenny!

No! Stop!

No no!

Ooh, what happened?

- He's still alive. We can drain him.

- Not him.

Aren't you the one who said

they're just cattle to us

and nothing else?

- Just do what you want.

- Look at this.

So, I guess he took her

with him?

F***!

I didn't know the little f***er

had it in him.

I'm actually

kind of proud of the kid.

Yeah, well, he's gonna

get himself in trouble.

He's right on the verge.

We've gotta find him.

Maybe you should

go get him.

He looks up to you.

Will you still help me

out there?

Francis,

where are we?

We're hiding.

Are you okay?

We should get some help.

Francis,

I need your help.

I can't come near you.

Francis, I can't hear you.

What?

What did you say,

Francis?

You're bleeding.

Francis, you're scaring me.

There's something

I need to tell you.

Please- please,

just help me get up.

We need to get help.

We're born, not made.

- Not like everybody thinks.

- I don't understand.

Oh Christ,

let me go.

Please, please-

Not like the f***ing movies.

Francis, please stop.

You have to go.

Francis, please

don't do this.

Franny.

I know.

We all gotta go

through it our first time.

It's just the way

it is, okay?

- I wish Mom and Dad were here.

- It just hurts so bad, David.

I know, I know.

It's just part

of growing up, okay?

It's what we are.

What does it mean

to be happy?

To be content

in the world around you?

Is family the heart

of everything-

even existence?

So what do we do now?

We have to move again.

The twins are packing up

the house.

We're gonna leave

in a few hours.

What about Lenny?

We're gonna have to bring him

out of the box early.

Will he be okay?

You were brought

out of the box early.

I was?

Yeah. See how

you turned out?

- Dave?

- Yeah?

I'm sorry.

So am I, Francis.

- Are you ready?

- Okay.

You guys, I really

hate keeping him like this.

You know it's the way

it's always been.

He would've

killed everything in sight.

- Kind of like us. You ready, David?

- Let me do this.

We're gonna open the door.

We don't have time for this.

- This is Lenny!

- Darlene, come on.

- David, let's go!

- He is- he is our family!

I can do this.

Okay.

Are you sure?

Fine.

Lenny?

Lenny?

Lenny?

Hey, baby.

Excited?

Hey, baby.

You see?

We live with a disease.

Mom used to say it was

the one thing that kept us close.

I always thought that it was the one

thing that would keep us apart.

But I was wrong,

and everything you thought

you knew about us is wrong.

We live in the houses

next to you,

we work in the stores

you shop at.

Our kids play with your kids.

We're just trying to be

an ordinary family,

trying to figure out

where we fit in in the world.

But we do need blood,

and we need a lot of it...

...preferably fresh

and not frozen.

Howdy.

We're the Thompsons.
