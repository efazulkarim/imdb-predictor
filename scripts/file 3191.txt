I am the yule tide cold

Leave the winter closed

Like hive of holy

Well, I dream of you

Nothing is

And the slick

To not peak at your

breast, love

Before the devil reigns

TORI: Thanks for

coming in, guys.

Thank you. Have a good one.

Oh, sh*t!

Hi.

You look amazing.

Hey, let me know if

you need anything.

TORI: Hey, it's almost 7:00,

so I'm going to start

closing up out back.

You got it?

-Yeah.

-Oh, can you put this away?

-Sure.

-Thank you.

-Hey!

-Oh, sh*t.

-Merry Christmas.

-Hi.

It's about time you show

your f*cking face around here.

Yeah, I've been busy.

You guys are swamped.

-I know, I know.

I thought you and Lahna

were closing tonight.

Yeah, no, I told her I had to

run home because I, um...

Didn't get her gift.

-I did get her a gift.

-Oh, did you?

But I'm now second guessing it,

so now I'm going

-to get some records.

-Oh, yeah, you should be

second guessing this.

She has both of these.

-She does.

-She does. Yeah.

Uh, follow me. Come on.

You guys been together

for, what, like a year?

How are you this f*cking dumb?

No, I'm not -- It's --

I can't tell the difference

between all these bands that

the logos all look the same.

-They all look the f*cking same?

-They all look the same.

-All scratchy and weird.

-Yeah, they kind of do.

Uh, all right, so what I'm going

to show you now -- Yes.

We saw these guys open at

a festival this summer.

She was f*cking all over it.

They've got the psychedelic,

cosmic riff.

She'll f*cking love it.

-Deathcrux?

-Yeah.

Okay. And she does

not have this?

-She does not have this.

-Right on.

-You're welcome.

-Yes. No, thank you, Tori.

Thank you.

You saved Christmas again.

TORI: By the way, I will come

and say Merry Christmas

-to Lauren.

-Sounds good.

But just don't tell her

I showed up here, okay?

-What are you talking about?

-Don't do the whole thing you do

-when you're like --

-"Oh, my God, it's so good

-to see you.

-No, yeah, don't do that.

-Okay, bye.

-Okay.

-Robbie.

-Hey, bro.

-Merry Christmas.

-Merry Christmas, man.

Bloody Christmas,

bloody Christmas

Bloody Christmas,

bloody Christmas

ROBBIE: f*ck yeah.

Almost 2 grand.

-Yeah, that's a big day.

-Does that mean a big boy bonus?

-Means a bonus, yeah.

-f*ck yeah, dawg!

[ Chuckles ] What are you going

to do with your big bonus?

You got any plans?

Well, the talent show

is at 8:00 p.m.

-So, no, not really.

-Yeah.

What are you going to do this

fine Christmas Eve?

I was potentially going to go

meet up with a dude,

but I don't know.

-A dude, a man.

-Yep.

Okay, on Christmas Eve,

you're going to invite

a stranger to your house.

Uh, a stranger to

Reggie's, yeah.

Okay, cool.

f*ck, they're still open.

-[ Chuckles ]

-Did you meet him organically,

or is this, like, a tinder

sort of scenario?

-Tinder situation, yeah.

-Oh, Tinder, okay.

-Yeah.

-Can I see him?

-Eh.

-Eh. He must be a f*cking stud.

What the f*ck else

am I supposed to do?

You want me to go home,

drink some whiskey,

sit by the fire by my lonesome,

watch "A Christmas Story"

like every other

f*cking douchebag in America?

Yeah. Sounds kind of nice.

Or you to go to

drink some whiskey with me.

Uh, that Lahna's Christmas gift.

-Is it?

-So you can put a f*ckin' --

-No longer.

-What the f*ck are you doing?

So, f*ck no.

I wanted to do that, too.

So hand me some cups,

and let's go.

Are you gonna go see

your pops up north tomorrow?

-Yeah.

-You should probably get

-a head start late tonight.

-No. f*ck that.

One day, in and out, is my rule.

I can't see anything

wrong in that.

-Fair enough.

-Mazel tov.

ROBBIE: Mazel tov.

Cheers, m*therf*cker.

Only quit stalling.

Show me Tommy Tinder.

What the f*ck is

your obsession with this?

-I want to see him.

-I don't want to

-show him to you.

-Is he big? Is he a big boy?

-Oh.

-BBW.

-That what you want to know?

-Yeah.

In that case,

I'll f*ckin' show you. Here.

What?

I didn't know you knew

Emmett Eyeliner.

Emmett Eyeliner.

Why are you calling him that?

-Do you know him?

-I know of him.

Did he tell you he got,

like, three kids?

Wait four.

Someone's pregnant now, I think.

-Oh, f*ck! He's got kids?

-Yeah.

I don't f*cking care.

I just want a little

Christmas Eve schlong.

Well, dude's a genic jackhammer.

-Oh, Jesus.

-Little, uh, sperm canon,

all I'm saying.

Okay, I'm happy you told me

that, so I'll wear my dental dam

and get f*cking sauced

before he shows up.

Thank you.

That's so sweet of you.

ROBBIE: Well,

I'll tell you what.

I can go to Reggie's with you

because, um, I don't really

have sh*t to do.

Robbie, that's very,

very sweet of you,

but I want to get laid.

Not wax poetic

with the regulars.

Well, seeing as you didn't

buy me a Christmas present

this year, I'm going

to take this.

-Oh.

-Thank you.

And you can enjoy your,

what, two hours

of unbearable conversation,

your 7 seconds of lame sex.

You go home, probably, you know,

get yourself off anyway.

Or, I'm just throwing

this out there,

you can have two hours of

amazing, vivacious,

sort of hauntingly

erotic conversation.

-Hauntingly erotic?

-Hauntingly erotic?

And you can go home anyway.

You know, get yourself off,

like, flick your little bean.

-Oh?

-Yeah.

And you don't have to wake up

next to 30 Seconds To Mars.

All right, well, I've got

a proposition for you.

How about you give me back

my f*cking whiskey

and stop talking about me

flicking at my f*cking bean?

-Okay.

-How about that?

Have you confirmed with him?

No, I have not given him a time.

Poor guy. It's kind of sad.

He's probably at home

scrolling through your

social media, fingers sweaty,

hand firmly on c*ck, just...

beating that meat,

waiting for your text

to pop up at the top.

Mm. I've blown off

twice already, so.

-Third time's a charm.

-Yeah.

Come on, get a drink

with your old pal Robbie.

It's my long time

employee Robbie.

-That's a little bit harsh.

-It's true. I own you.

-You own me?

-You're on my payroll. Yeah.

Mama. Okay. Okay. Okay.

I'm going to change your mind.

Have you heard his music?

-I have not bothered, no.

-Oh, that answers a lot.

Why? What you got?

ROBBIE: I'll show you something

Something fun.

TORI: Hmm.

All right. Ready?

I'm losing interest already.

Come on.

Alright, you'll see.

Hang on, hang on, hang on,

hang on, hang on.

What?

-Oh, my God.

-Soothing.

TORI: Shut the f*ck up.

Why is he whisper singing?

ROBBIE: Doesn't want to

wake his parents, probably.

What the f*ck?

Turn that off.

Why are you showing

that to me? Stop.

Well, you know, it's not like

you're going to saddle up

with the son of a b*tch.

I mean, you should probably

let the guy go back

to his family and his kids.

He's a daddy, after all.

-Daddy?

-Yeah.

Little Tommy Tinder.

Well...

All right.

Let's go get sh*t faced.

But you're not getting

anything either.

So if you want to go flick

your f*cking bean,

do what you need to do.

-Come on.

-All right.

-Turn off the music.

-Well, considering you were

gonna saddle up

with old Emmett Eyeliner,

I'm not sure

how I should feel about that.

Well, I don't work with them

Emmett Eyeliner, do I?

Well, I am better looking in

that douche, though, right?

Do you want to f*cking die?

Get your f*cking grubby shoes

off the counter.

k*ll the music

before I change my mind.

-Should I meet you there or?

-No, We're going to walk.

-Well, it's f*cking snowing out.

-Oh, my God. That's so scary!

Come on.

Get those chicken legs out.

Let's go for a walk.

I got to bring this to Lahna.

ROBBIE: Why? They close at 6:00.

They're not going to be open.

No, they'll still be there.

They're having a little

Christmas Eve Fuckfest.

What the hell, Why?

TORI: You don't want to f*ck

in a toy store?

No. Well, mm, maybe. I mean...

Sounds like you don't want

to f*ck in a toy store.

It's just kind of weird.

Like, I feel sorry for the kid

that's going to go in tomorrow,

buy a teddy bear covered

-in f*cking cum.

-Oh, my God.

We're going to scar him.

That poor child.

Come on. Lock up behind you.

ROBBIE:

We could have taken my car.

Would have been a smart option.

Do you want to keep

keep complaining?

Or do you want to just walk

in silence?

-What do you want to do?

-You're the one who was

complaining all day about

f*cking Christmas this,

Christmas that, oh, I f*cking

hate Christmas.

Well, Christmas f*cking sucks.

Do you not agree that there's

no good f*cking Christmas music,

-no good Christmas movies.

-Bad Religion had

-a great Christmas album.

-Just f*cking get it over with.

-Eh.

-It was good.

There aren't many albums

that give me that spirit

of f*cking Christmas.

Well, Bad f*ckin' Religion,

ain't it, buddy.

Give me that.

I would go as far to say

there's like f*cking two --

two Christmas songs

that are good,

and that's if you don't count,

if and only if, you don't count

f*cking Crypt Keeper

"Christmas Rap."

Okay, love

"Tales From the Crypt."

That song sucks the f*cking sh*t

out of my a*s.

This is coming from a guy

who jizzes his f*cking pants

every single time he hears

Buster Poindexter's cover of

"Zat You, Santa Claus?"

ROBBIE: No, no, no, no, no, no.

I don't like that cover.

I like the version

with the commentary

from Beavis and Butthead.

-Okay.

-Okay.

"Merry Christmas", Ramones,

then.

That's mine. What's your big

f*cking runner up?

Uh, sorry to say,

but "Merry Christmas", Ramones,

that's a f*cking runner up.

-Yeah.

-f*ck you.

-First place --

-f*ck you.

First place is our lord

and savior Lemmy

with "Run Rudolph Run."

Oh, it's magic!

ROBBIE: Okay.

It's not like it's Motorhead.

It's Lemmy with

the f*cking Foo Fighters.

-Oh, R.I.P.

-Oh, R.I.P.

Also Lemmy is f*cking Motorhead,

you idiot.

Yeah.

Hey!

Lahna! [ Laughs ]

She knows you're coming, right?

Yeah, of course

she knows I'm f*cking coming.

Oh.

-Hey, b*tch.

-Hi!

Mwah! You look so good.

-Thank you.

-Hey, gorgeous.

-Mwah.

-Mwah.

I brought you and Jay

a little something, something.

Ooh, I got you this.

Oh, my God. I love you so much.

-I missed you.

-I missed you, too.

TORI: Where's Jay?

He's in the back, freshening up.

You know, he just gets

a little musty.

He gets a little musty?

-You got a lot going on.

-Musty she says.

LAHNA: Yeah, you know

all about that, right?

-No, I do.

-You know all about that?

-Baby.

-Yeah.

You know all about

a little musty must?

I got a stinky d*ck.

-[ Laughs ] That's so f*cked up.

-Cute, right?

-b*tch.

-Yeah?

You already cracked this open.

We may have had, like,

like a couple of drinks.

This is the nicest thing

anybody's ever done for me.

I know. I know. It's very nice.

And listen.

Because we love you.

we didn't buy it for you.

We're giving it to you.

-Well, merry f*cking Christmas.

-Merry f*cking Christmas.

-Baby!

-On it. Jesus Christ!

-Hey!

-This m*therf*cker.

I haven't seen you in so long.

-How are you?

-Oh, yeah. Right?

-How are you?

-Hey, bro.

-Hey, buddy. Merry Christmas.

-Merry Christmas.

-You look good.

-Thank you.

-Yeah, you do.

-I've been doing nothing but

selling toys and f*cking

living the clean life.

-Keep up.

-[ Sniffs ]

Oh! Um, what's up with you two?

What's going on here?

-Uh, just grabbing a drink.

-Just grabbing a drink.

I had to talk her out

of some Tinder trash.

You didn't talk me

out of anything.

What was his name?

Emmett -- Emmett --

-We don't have to talk --

-Emmett! Oh, sh*t!

TORI: No, I think

we're ignoring that.

Motherfuckin' four-kid Emmett.

Four kid Emmett?

-No.

-Nearly five kid Emmett.

Four kid Emmett. Why does

everybody know Emmett

-except for me?

-He's got four kids.

-All right. Well, cheers. Yeah.

-No, no, no.

What was the song? What was

the song? It was...

We don't need the song.

And her heart

whispers in my head

-Alright, f*ckers.

-Go for it, tap on in.

Because she's half dead

-Tori!

-No, no, no, no.

Come back, come back,

come back, come back.

-Come back, come back.

-Alright, you guys, I'm back.

-It's a catchy song.

-It's a good song.

It's the feel good hit

of the winter.

-Okay, cheers.

-Cheers.

-To Christmas!

-To Christmas!

-Bah humbug.

-Bah humbug.

SANTA: Ho, ho, ho.

Come sit on Santa's lap

and tell him what you

want for Christmas.

-Ugh!

-[ Laughs ]

-I f*cking hate that.

-No, they all get recalled.

Priest said that to me

when I was a young boy.

Are you okay?

You're not f*cking okay.

-No, I'm not well.

-It's so bad.

Thank God they're taking it out

on Friday.

Has he ever come to life

while you guys were f*cking?

Oh, he joins.

-Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

-He's anatomical.

-Oh, really?

-Big bad Santa.

-Okay.

-Big Santa.

-But I am hoping that they

leave behind this aspect of it.

TORI: What?

[ Whirring ]

-Oh!

-Oh, baby, it's so romantic!

Okay, we're getting the f*ck

out of here.

This is too much

Christmas for me.

-Oh, no, no.

-No, no, no, stay, stay.

Stop! I f*ckin' -- that's a lot.

That is a lot.

It's really excessive. We're

gonna have one drink and go.

-All right. Yeah, fine.

-Fine.

JAY: We could just --

You guys hang out.

-We could have some more drinks.

-We're not going to hang out.

-The four of us.

-We're not gonna hang out.

-Santa, the anatomical Santa.

-We're good.

-Okay, alright.

-Alright.

-Easy, tiger.

-Alright.

-Cheers.

-Cheers.

f*ck. Merry Christmas

to a f*ckin' day off.

-Little bit of flavor in there.

-Yeah.

-Mm.

-Okay, I love you.

Get the f*ck out.

I want to f*ck my husband.

-Mwah.

-Merry Christmas.

-Merry Christmas.

-Bye.

-See you.

-See you.

-See ya, bud.

-All right. We're going.

-Goodbye.

-See ya.

Oh, she's whispering

in my head

f*cking hate you guys!

I'm half deaf for you

I'm stealing your candy.

Thank you.

-Come on, let's go.

-Ugh!

[ Laughs ] Let's f*cking go.

-God!

-Come on!

Coming. I'm coming.

SANTA: Ho, ho, ho.

Merry Christmas.

Sowell Robotic Products'

new animatronic

state of the art Santa Claus

featured at our own

T.W. Bonkers is now the subject

of an international recall.

There have been reports that

some of the Santa units

are reverting to their old

Defense Department firmware.

Thus far, most of the reports

have been of harmless pranks.

f*ck no! [ Laughs ]

Larry, can you turn

that sh*t off?

-That's so depressing.

-Yeah.

-[ Laughs ]

-You guys want one more

to close it out?

Yeah, we will.

Can we get another round

and a shot of whiskey, please?

You're going to chase a shot

of whiskey with more whiskey?

I am. It's a holiday.

That's what you do.

-This is true.

-Thank you.

Is this, uh, together?

Or separate?

Togeth-- Together.

It's on one bill. I got it.

-Oh, la di da.

-It's part of your bonus.

Although I am a little

disappointed.

He didn't even offer

to pay for the f*ckin' last --

Excuse me, this is not

a date, remember?

Yeah, no, I f*ckin'

remember now.

Happy I didn't think otherwise.

-Fun hangout

-Yeah.

Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

You think would have

picked up the tab for, uh,

Doctor f*ckin' Emmett Eyeliner.

Depends on how the night went.

Probably would have forgotten

his wallet or something.

Mnh-mnh. Did this dude f*ck

your mom or something?

Why the f*ck -- every single

time you talk about him,

I'm like so close

to forgetting him,

and then you bring him up again.

I'm just like, just like,

it baffles me

that you were going to let him,

like, you know,

-stick his p*nis just...

-Taint me?

-...inside you.

-He's gonna f*ckin' taint me?

-He was gonna taint you.

-Yeah, I'm horny,

and it's a holiday.

What am I supposed to do?

Do you want to go through --

Larry, do you want to go through

Robbie's list of prize catches?

-Not again.

-'Cause f*ckin' --

no, remember this?

Remember rotten Rebecca?

The one that smelled like

a f*cking fish market.

-Oh, God.

-She was great.

Yeah, had to walk out

of the room every time...

-Rotten Rebecca.

-...every time she f*cking

walked in one.

Oh, my God.

That honestly made me

want to throw up.

That was so gross.

Who else? Come on.

Do you want to talk about Tina?

-Tina?

-Googly eyed Tina?

Do you want me to keep going?

That's my point.

-That was a condition.

-Do you want me to keep going?

-She couldn't help it.

-Okay.

-She's a beautiful woman.

-Can you shut the f*ck up?

JAY: Okay, babe, no, seriously.

He's been her employee

for years.

One, I think

it's illegal if they f*ck.

And two, he'll never

close the deal.

[ Warbling ]

LAHNA: She had that glow

in her eyes.

JAY: Okay, okay, fine.

No, she f*cking might have.

But he won't even come close to

closing the deal.

-What?

-Not at all.

LAHNA: 1,000 percent

they're f*cking tonight.

-f*ck that.

-Unless Robbie's d*ck

gets chopped up,

they're gonna f*ck tonight.

JAY: What are you f*ck--

f*ck that. Okay. All right.

-You want him bet?

-Yeah.

[ Footsteps thudding ]

JAY: Okay, great, great,

great, great.

Alright, how much you f*cking

want to bet then?

Are you ever going

to settle down,

you know, chill the f*ck out.

Are you?

-Yeah.

-Yeah?

-Hopefully.

-Oh, okay, great.

Well, maybe I'll f*cking settle

down when I can find a man

that can keep up with me.

Do you know how hard it

is being in a world

surrounded by so many boys

that can't handle a woman

who can out drink, out earn

and out f*ck them,

for the love of God?

Do you know

how many men cannot f*ck?

-There's a few.

-No.

-And some can.

-None of them know

how to eat p*ssy.

I'll tell you that right now.

-See, I beg to differ.

-No.

In fact, I would argue

there are one,

maybe two people

in this general vicinity

who can do it with the ferocity

of a f*cking tyrannosaurus

-No, No.

-[ Growling ]

-Larry.

-Larry.

Can you please,

for the love of God,

give me one more round.

-[ Footsteps thudding ]

-LAHNA: I'll be you

that if they f*ck,

I'll make you a steak dinner.

-Really?

-Yeah.

Wearing nothing but an apron.

[ Footsteps thudding ]

JAY: If I lose?

LAHNA: Oh, when you lose,

you have to eat my

a*s out on this throne.

JAY: Well, why wait? Why don't

I eat it f*ckin' right now?

Daddy's hungry.

Ah! Daddy!

[ Gasps ] Oh!

I can trace it back

every f*cking time.

The second they cut their hair,

they cut their worst record!

Ah, it's just such

an absurd claim.

It isn't -- It's a f*cking

absurdly correct claim.

-[ Chuckles ]

-Is what it is. Okay?

Do you remember that f*cking

study I showed you?

-Oh, yeah. The scientist one.

-Yes, the f*ckin' scientist one.

The second that they cut

the hair of

a Native American person,

they lost, like,

-all sense of intuition.

-Okay.

-Like f*cking all of it.

-First off.

-And it's really scary.

-First off.

Whatever bullshit f*cking blog

you pulled that study off --

-A government study, dude.

-Government.

Has about as much merit as

the f*cking Reddit thread.

-Okay.

-Second off, second off,

that has absolutely zero

f*cking merit when it comes to

talking about somebody's actual

musical ability.

Okay. I'm going to go through

the f*cking list.

-Okay, do it.

-Metallica.

-Yeah?

-Yeah.

They cut their hair,

the f*ckers release "Load."

Yeah? Soundgarden.

Cornell cuts his hair off.

Opts for the Spencers Gift tips

with the frosted spikes,

and then the m*therf*ckers

release "Superunknown"!

-What is that?!

-Boom! Boom right there, b*tch!

Voids your argument?

Do you know why?

-Why? Tell me why.

-'Cause "Superunknown",

-peak Soundgarden.

-Oh, f*ckin' --

-Are you kidding me?

-Not one bad track on the album.

TORI: Are you actually going to

stop with the f*cking

Jesus Christ pose right now?

What the f*ck?!

Are you serious?!

-Are you f*ckin' --

-[ Groans ]

Are you f*cking kidding me?

[ Laughs ]

That's so f*ckin' dumb,

so f*ckin' dumb.

-[ Groans ]

-Let me guess.

You prefer you prefer, uh,

you prefer Van Hagar?

"Prefer" is a strong word.

They lost zero appeal

when Diamond Dave ducked out.

-Oh! Really?

-Yes, really.

Because it's around that time

that they got

rid of their  guitar god,

and then replaced him

with a synth loving clone

of said  guitar god.

Alright, get your a*s

off the bar, Robbie.

-Oh.

-Hate to break up the party.

I got four little

diaper pissers at home.

They're going to wake me

up in four hours. Let's --

Yes, thank you.

I don't want to listen to this

f*cking guy anyway.

-Sweet baby. Jesus.

-Mm, got my card.

Slow your roll, Larry.

Got two more coming my way.

-I'll pour you one.

-Hands behind your back.

-Hands behind my back?

-You're lucky like you.

Yeah, and you're lucky I don't

have health inspector

shut this sh*t hole down.

[ Chuckles ]

He's right.

Is he right?

-And pour Tori and her new beau.

-Oh, thanks, man.

One and one for yourself, Larry.

I didn't know

you two were a thing.

-We're not.

-Yet.

Get f*cked.

MONROE: The wife's back

is with her family.

So that's why I'm spending

Christmas alone.

Unless you count

that f*cking mutt

that won't keep its trap shut.

Why do you have a f*cking

dog then, man?

You think I wanted that thing?

-That's all Donna.

-Okay.

That little son of a whore

is like an angel around her.

But with me, just me,

it won't shut the f*ck up

because I won't spoil him,

like Donna does.

Just like with her old man.

Yeah, I think -- I think it

sounds like the dog just

probably needs, like, some

lovin' from Daddy Monroe.

-Like.

-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I think the little bastard needs

his b*lls clipped.

-Hey, man.

-Sure.

Donna had me get

my b*lls clipped

-two days after Henry was born.

-Jesus f*cking Christ.

You're gonna wake up

a sleeping, Junior.

Well, uh, here,

let's have a toast.

I think you've had enough

there, Supercuts.

-[ Laughs ]

-Cheers.

-[ Glasses clink ]

-Cheers.

Here, let me, uh, cover

what these kids are drinking.

-Oh, no, no, that's --

-No, hey, hey, hey, hey.

-You...

-Thank you, Chief.

-...keep the rest for yourself.

-Thank you.

MONROE: Watch yourself

with that one.

Merry Christmas, Sheriff.

m*therf*cker,

wipe that smirk off...

Mm. That sucked the

f*cking Christmas early.

ROBBIE: God damn, what a sad

f*ckin' human being.

LARRY: You gonna be

good to drive?

Uh, no.

I drove with Robbie --

I f*ckin' walked with Robbie.

If I drove you, you'd be f*cked.

So much for drinking

every guy under the table.

Excuse me. You've got, like,

at least five pounds on me.

Soaking wet maybe.

LARRY: Get her home safe.

Robbie.

What the f*ck's that's

supposed to mean?

-It's a big world out there.

-You get home safe.

Better watch for your children.

[ Laughs ]

-I'm just kidding.

-Sounded so threatening.

-Good night.

-Thank you, Larry.

-Ugh.

-Come on.

-[ Footsteps thudding ]

-[ Lahna moaning ]

LAHNA: Yes!

JAY: Oh, sh*t.

LAHNA: Not yet.

JAY: It's coming early.

LAHNA: Hold it.

No, baby, hold it.

Hold it! You better not!

f*ck! You better not!

Ah!

[ Screams ]

Like, what did

he arrest you for?

It was f*cking --

you were like --

you were like pissing

on a playground.

I didn't know the kid

was going to show up like that.

Oh, f*ck, and the kid

was his grandson.

Yeah, I made him a man.

That's f*cked.

You took that away from him.

-I know.

-You took it away him.

[ Lahna screaming ]

[ Thudding ]

[ Screaming ]

[ Clattering ]

[ Panting ]

[ Screams ]

Somebody help!

Do you want to keep drinking,

or...?

I mean, yeah.

What are you thinking?

-What am I thinking?

-Yeah.

[ Footsteps thudding ]

[ Lahna screams ]

[ Thudding ]

[ Screams ]

You can come over

and k*ll that bottle with me.

-Really?

-Yeah.

-Are you sure?

-Yeah.

Come k*ll the f*cking bottle.

I said come over for a drink,

not over for a f*ck.

[ Screams ]

-[ Screams ]

-[ Glass shatters ]

Well, it sounds like someone's

hankering for a little bit of --

[ Lahna screaming ]

-You hear that?

-Hear what?

[ Screaming ]

[ Thudding ]

[ Glass shatters ]

Yeah, dawg!

Jay hitting that pipe.

Yeah, he's hitting

that f*cking pipe.

Speaking of, have you seen it?

Yeah, it's f*cking fat

-It's fat.

-Oh, he be gaping that sh*t

[ Thud ]

[ Footsteps thudding ]

How old are you, f*ckin' 12?

I can see you smoking

that blunt from here!

-I didn't f*ckin' ask --

-I said give it to me!

I need to salvage

this Lincoln Log...

-No!

-...before you run it into

the f*ckin' ground.

[ Footsteps thudding ]

Yeah, I want to f*ckin'

salvage this thing.

What are we watching when

we get to yours,

"A Christmas Story"?

What is your f*cking obsession

with "A Christmas Story"?

What's your issue

with "A Christmas Story"?

You're the one that

brought it up earlier.

Everyone's obsessed with it.

If you want to watch

a Bob Clark Christmas movie

will watch

f*cking "Black Christmas."

Oh, that --

that Blumhouse joint?

I'm just going to

drive myself home.

No, no, no. You said we were

going to my car --

If you want to go home

and f*cking jerk off

-to f*cking Blumhouse movies --

-Get your f*ckin' a*s over here.

Okay, but are you done spewing

garbage out of your f*ckin'

-whore mouth?

-Oh, there it is.

There's your f*ckin'

Rhode Island accent.

I maybe sound like

I'm from Rhode Island,

but at least I don't have

sh*t taste in movies,

sh*t opinions on everything,

and drive a f*cking sh*t car.

ROBBIE: Uh, excuse me,

this is basically

the same as your f*cking car.

Don't say that about her.

She's beautiful.

-Also --

-I get her first.

ROBBIE: My lady. My lady.

You got to get in on this side.

You haven't got

this f*cking car fixed yet?

ROBBIE: With what you pay me,

you think I can afford

a f*cking door?

What are you doing

with your paychecks?

-This is --

-My minimum, my minimum --

That's embarrassing.

ROBBIE: My minimum

f*cking wage paycheck.

Yeah, your minimum

f*cking wage paycheck.

-Get it.

-That should be

-a f*cking priority.

-Please.

-Wow.

-Lady.

No, I changed my f*cking mind.

I changed my mind.

Hop in, hot shot.

We got f*cking whiskey waiting.

-Get in.

-Oh, whiskey you say?

-Yes.

-Okay, in that case,

-shut your f*cking mouth.

-Oh, this mouth.

This f*cking whore mouth

and that devil's tongue, baby.

-Ew, shut the -- Robbie.

-Come on, what?

-This is a --

-Get your f*ckin' a*s in.

Don't touch my f*ckin' a*s.

She got a bit of a fight in her.

All right.

-Call f*cking H.R.

-I'll give you space.

No wonder you don't

get f*ckin' laid.

[ Cans clattering ]

-Look at this.

-What?

No wonder you don't

get f*cking laid.

-This is disgusting.

-It adds to the flavor.

Adds to the flavor of what?

A f*cking chicken coop.

This is f*cked up.

Some empty cans and bottles.

That's Tori Tooms' break?

No, but it's the nail

in the f*cking coffin

because this is really bad.

-Come on, baby.

-How do you live like this?

-Let's cowboy up.

-Just take my car.

-[ Engine sputters ]

-Just take my f*cking card.

You just got to be patient

with her.

-[ Engine sputters ]

-I'm gonna lose my buzz.

[ Laughs ]

[ Engine starts ]

-Hey!

-Oh, God.

-Jesus.

-Feel that between my pants.

We're going to have to roll this

up the hill ourselves.

-Alright.

-Whoa. Jesus f*cking Christ.

I don't feel safe.

What are you -- okay.

She's road worthy.

Don't even worry about it.

TORI: Okay! Here we go.

[ Footsteps thudding ]

Oh, if this guy parks his

f*cking Ranchero here

one more time,

I'm going to total it,

smash out his f*cking windows.

ROBBIE: Little harsh

to the Griswolds.

TORI: NO, it's boozin' Benny

down at the bottom of the hill.

-He's a f*cking alcoholic.

-Boozin' Benny.

TORI: Just pull up behind

my sister's car.

ROBBIE: Wait.

Your sister is here?

TORI: Do you not listen

to a f*cking thing I say?

ROBBIE: Well, I mean, I listen,

but I don't retain.

TORI: Yeah, well, I don't want

to retain the stink

from this f*cking chicken coop,

so get out.

Come on, let's go drink.

-Beautiful.

-Oh, Jesus.

-All right, my lady.

-Listen, I really can't --

Please exit your chariot.

I honestly -- I'm -- whoa.

I'm too drunk for this. Jesus.

Walk carefully, please.

Thank you.

And treat her

with respect and dignity.

Uh, welcome to my humble abode.

Yeah, it's cute. It's uh --

Charming, classy, cute.

I know.

-Yeah, sure.

-Extravagant.

-Rustic.

-Yeah.

Humble. Barn-like.

I really hope we don't take

my sister out because

I don't want to have

to awkwardly introduce you.

Wait, so are we drinking

alone tonight, or what?

Robbie, do not f*cking

listen to me?

They're out cold.

Out cold already?

It's not even midnight.

Plus, my lame a*s brother in law

doesn't even drink, so...

Oh, that f*cking c**t Mike.

Yeah?

Mr. Hollywood? Yeah. [ Laughs ]

[ Rock music playing ]

These g*dd*mn neighbors and

their f*cking obnoxious lights.

Hey, Tori.

How much music was there

in "Unsolved Mysteries"?

-[ Chuckles ] What?

-I mean, like, I don't --

I don't want to --

I don't want to scare you,

like, in your own home,

but there's like six hours

worth of the

"Unsolved Mysteries" soundtrack?

What the f*ck is your problem

with "Unsolved Mysteries"?

I mean, like, 30 second intro,

and then, like,

do you need six hours?

TORI: Have you heard it?

No, not the entire f*cking

expanse of isolated soundtrack.

Oh, well, it is the f*cking

creepiest g*dd*mn synth pads

you will ever hear

in your f*cking life.

-Mm-hmm. Right.

-They're amazing. Put it on.

Yeah, okay. No, I've already got

something queued up.

No, put it on. I want you to get

like soaked up and like

-immersed in it.

-No, no, no, I'm good.

-I'm good.

-It's so good. Please.

Robbie. All right, fine. At

least I know it won't be "Load."

-Oh, I know. I already looked.

-Oh, did you?

Of course.

Oh, come on, Robbie.

"Rhythms From a Cosmic Sky" is,

like, at least four times --

Oh, you're the worst

f*ckin' opinion.

No, everybody knows that.

What are you talking about?

Uh, it's in your collection.

Yeah, because I'm a completist.

Thank you.

-Not for Metallica.

-Shut up.

Follow -- get that

f*cking thing away from me.

Okay.

I'm weirdly turned on by this.

-Really?

-But I need you to stop.

[ Mechanical whirring ]

MAN: Hey, Freddy.

Buddy, let's not open gifts.

f*cking aggressive as hell,

early '90s grunge!

Traci Lords has three g*dd*mn

songs on the album,

and they're f*cking good,

they're so good.

So, you think it's better

because Traci Lords, porn star,

f*cking superstar, big titty

Traci Lords has, what, like,

f*ckin' two tracks on the album.

No, three, by the way,

and better story.

Better music, obviously.

Better kills.

Better makeup,

-Shut the f*ck up.

No, no, I am like,

k*lled them and then took

the f*cking suit.

That's what I'm saying.

He k*lled everybody.

-You need back up!

What do you want to do

with Davies' car?

Nothing. Don't touch it.

f*cking crime scene.

I'll call and have it

towed into the station.

Alright. Be safe.

TORI: I need your f*cking help.

-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

-Do you f*cking job.

Shut the f*ck up!

[ Police radio chatter ]

You can't send him there alone.

I don't think you're in any

position to tell me what to do.

You know, you're in a world

of hurt, lady.

-No f*cking --

-You're in a world

-of f*cking sh*t.

-No f*cking idea!

We caught you covered in blood

and a missing cop --

MAN: Unit 17, Smith, you there?

Yeah. This is unit 17.

This is Smith. Go ahead.

MAN: This is Lenny.

We just got here.

It's a m*ssacre, and we haven't

even been inside yet.

Alright, copy that. Look, don't

make a move, alright?

Just hang back.

Weston's on his way down there.

Any word from Renn County?

MAN: Just us right now, sir.

Any sign of Davies?

MAN: He's dead, sir.

f*ck! f*ck! m*therf*cker!

I just saw you at Reggie's

three g*dd*mn hours ago.

I don't understand.

What is there

to f*cking understand?

What I don't understand

is the lax f*cking attitude

when people are f*cking dead.

Look, Tori, we know you didn't

m*rder anyone,

but we're having a hard time

believing what you're saying.

I'm having a hard time

f*cking believing it. Okay?

But I saw it. I saw it

with my own g*dd*mn eyes.

And my f*cking eyes don't lie.

Okay, Monroe?

Listen, I can smell the weed

and whiskey on you

-from a mile away.

-Yeah. So f*cking what?

I smoked some weed.

I had some f*cking whiskey.

But that does not

make you hallucinate.

I promise you. I promise you.

After what I saw, I'm sober.

I'm sober as a f*cking --

Oh, that's good you're sober.

Well, I hate to break it to you,

Ms. Tooms,

but it is still illegal.

Can you shut the f*ck up?

Shut the f*ck up!

My sister is dead!

Okay? My f*cking friends

are dead.

Not that you give

a f*ck about him.

But what are you going

to do about it?

-What do you --

-Hey! Hey!

The best g*dd*mn officer

in this precinct is dead.

Now, if you want to be the one

to tell his widow.

Oh, f*ck. Debbie.

Someone's got to tell Debbie.

Hey, hey, hey, Bobby.

We're all getting

a little emotional here.

Just cut it. Both of yous.

You, sit down.

Get this f*cking

off your f*cking desk.

[ Monroe sighs ]

Have you heard from the boys

down at the scene yet?

Not since Renn County

showed up.

They're still down

there counting bodies.

Nothing about a k*ller

Santa Claus either.

MONROE: Well, why don't you

give him a call?

It's been a little while now.

See if they need any help.

I think they got it

under control.

Double check.

f*ck!

You need to keep that as*h*le

away from me, Monroe.

He's worked with Davies

for over 15 years now.

We're tight staff. Look around.

It's been a rough night

for all of us.

-[ Laughing ]

-Bear with us.

We'll do the same.

Just breathe.

[ Sighs ]

Okay, I'm going to brew

a fresh pot of coffee.

There's a bathroom down the hall

if you want to

clean yourself up some.

[ Electric buzzing ]

[ Sighs ]

[ Sighs ]

[ Indistinct talking

in distance ]

SMITH: There is no

f*cking back up, man.

MONROE: Just hold on a second.

Just hold on a second.

We got to think this out.

TORI: Oh, sh*t.

Have tried the guys

from Renn?

Yep, Renn, paramedics, Weston.

Nothing.

CHP? Anything?

-Nope.

-Hey. Hey. Hey.

-What's going on?

-You coming with me or not?

TORI: Something happen? You guys

can't go back to my house.

-I told you.

-We're police, Tori.

-That's what we do.

-Well, no.

You need to call the f*cking

National Guard or something.

He wiped everybody out.

He's going to wipe you out!

Hey, you know, Monroe,

maybe you should stay here.

You can, baby sit

the little girl.

Okay, you know what?

If you don't want to f*cking

listen to me,

you go out there and die.

Because, quite frankly,

I don't f*cking care.

Tori, we're going to go,

we're gonna lock the door.

-No, no.

-Oh, oh, oh, oh.

-[ Siren wailing ]

-What is that?

Yeah. What the f*ck is that?

That an ambulance?

Oh, f*ck. It's him.

Oh, Santa Claus?

-Yeah, it's f*ckin' Santa Claus.

-f*ckin' Santa Claus!

It's the m*therf*cker

that k*lled everybody.

Okay, okay, uh...

-Oh, f*ck.

-He's not stopping.

f*ck!

[ expl*si*n ]

[ Glass shattering ]

f*ck! Ah!

MONROE: Is everyone all right?

Yeah, I think I'm fine.

-Tori?

-Uh, yeah.

[ Coughing ]

Jesus Christ.

What the f*ck was that?

Hey, Tori, take these,

go to the holding room,

lock yourself in.

No, no, no!

There's f*cking people dead.

You need to give me a g*n. You

need to give me a f*cking g*n.

-Where the driver?

-You're 38. Give her your 38.

Are you out

of your f*cking mind?

-Give me your f*cking g*n.

-Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Hey, do you even know

how to use that thing?

TORI: Yeah. You aim is and pull

the f*cking trigger.

Yeah?

Let's go.

[ Panting ]

Cover me.

Okay. I'm clear.

Tori, get in there!

Stay away from the f*cking car!

He's in there!

Do you see anything?

Something's not right.

Something's not right!

Yeah, he's not f*cking human.

That's what's not right.

Do you see anything?

[ Screaming, g*nshots ]

Monroe! Monroe!

Oh, f*ck!

Where are you, m*therf*cker?!

Show yourself!

Get out of here now!

Come on, m*therf*cker!
