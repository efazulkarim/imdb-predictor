Mom, Mom! Uncle Jonas is here!

No, it's not Tuesday today.

But it is. He's here.

So, after the Germans surrendered,

when did our King return to

Norway from exile?

Um...

June 7th, 1945.

And on what date did the

Norwegian parliament

hold its first election

after the war?

- Um, July 6...

- Don't guess.

Eh...

August the...

On what date...

did the Norwegian parliament

hold its first election since the war?

Uh... August...

August 12th, 1945.

You have to help him more.

I'm going to tell your wife

that he's your son.

And then, she can tell

the rest of your family.

Then you'll never see me again.

Stop! Please!

Wait!

- No!

- Jonas!

No! Jonas!

No!

Jonas!

Mom!

Mom?

Mom, come on!

We gotta get outta here!

Mom, come on!

Open the door!

Mom, come on!

Open the door!

Mom!

Mom!

No!

Don't leave me!

No!

Sh*t.

Good morning.

F***!

Harry Hole?

Hello.

Dry rot throughout

the whole building.

And I'm afraid we found

some mold behind the walls.

Aspergillus.

Toxic and pathogenic.

Your landlord let me in

to spray the apartment.

I'm gonna have to

take all these panels off.

And this is above your bed.

Jesus Christ.

Is there anywhere else

that you could stay?

The air in here is so bad

you're actually killing

your house plants.

I'm not disturbing you, am I?

You are familiar with

Emanuel Vigeland?

The brothers' work was most

likely influenced by their father...

who turned to drink...

had an illegitimate child

with younger woman...

What a tragedy.

Yeah, I didn't know that about him.

You can clearly see

in each artist's case...

the recurring themes of

love perverted and betrayed.

The good news is that with this

new version of the EVISYNC...

from version 3.6 to version 4.0...

allows you to manually push

the data back to the server...

using the cellular network.

The EVISYNC will automatically

upload all the new data...

to the central police server

here every 12 hours.

We've also done some work

on the fingerprint scanning software.

So, you will notice

a significantly faster

opening time after

scanning your fingerprint.

But please make sure

that your fingerprint scans

are done cleanly

and clearly from the start.

If you are experiencing

a high number of false scans,

this is probably because

your fingerprints

were scanned incorrectly

from the start.

That must be nearly a whole

week of mail this time.

Did I miss anything

while I was away?

My uncle died.

Close, were you?

A leave of absence has to be

formally requested in writing.

Doesn't matter who you are.

Backdate it.

But I can't keep covering for you.

I'm dealing with it.

I need a case to work on.

I apologize for Oslo's

low murder rate.

Let's uh...

stick to the uncle story.

You scared my clients away.

I didn't forget Oleg's birthday.

I got him concert tickets.

What did you do?

We took him for a pizza.

Oleg misses you.

He doesn't get along

very well with Mathias.

What about you?

I'm not going to answer that.

He wants to meet his real father.

I don't think he's ready for that.

Thank you for

walking me back home.

See you at the game.

Tell Oleg...

I'm sorry I missed it.

Hi.

The snowman.

Snowman.

I'll take a picture.

He's beautiful, honey.

Mommy!

Hi.

Hello.

- May I borrow your scarf?

- You want my scarf?

I told you

I had to leave by 8:00.

And I told you that

I had to help one of my students.

No, thanks.

It's the smoking room.

Yeah, but it's the only place

I can concentrate, so.

I'm um, I'm Katrine Bratt.

Harry Hole.

I know who you are. We um...

We actually studied

your cases at the academy.

I didn't know

they date back that far.

Yeah, you're up there

with the legends, so.

I don't know who you are.

No, I'm new. I um...

I transferred from Bergen.

Actually, they put me in your office.

Okay. Bye.

Mom?

Mommy?

Mommy?

Okay, where can I drop you?

I'm on a call.

It's okay. I'm in no hurry.

So, why don't you have a car?

I don't have a license.

Missing persons.

Yeah, it's a woman.

The uh, call just came in.

So, this machine

is called an EVISYNC...

I will record you, so there's

a little camera on the other side.

- Well aware of it.

- Right.

Would you like to

walk me through what happened?

W-well, I saw Josephine

in the garden in her pajamas...

and uh, I thought, what is

she doing out in this cold?

So I came over to check.

And she said

she couldn't find her mother.

I tried calling the father, but

apparently, he's away on business.

How long has she been missing?

Two days.

She said she was going to visit her

friend and she never came back.

Why did you come to me?

I've been suspended.

'Cause you're a friend.

And you're a great detective.

But I don't want anyone

knowing about this just yet.

Not yet. I don't

want to go to the police.

Can you tell me...

Was your wife seeing anyone?

I uh, checked her credit card bills.

She'd been to see

a pregnancy doctor.

Well, uh, that's

great news, Frederik.

We haven't shared a bed

in three years.

This is Birte Becker.

Please leave a message.

This is Birte Becker.

Please leave a message.

This is Birte Becker.

Hello, Mr. Donkey.

Can I sit down?

It's a nice place

you've got here, Mr. Donkey.

Did you do this by yourself?

My mom helped me.

Was she in a good mood

when she got home?

Mm-hmm.

And what about your dad?

He was grumpy again

'cause mommy was late.

Did she call

to say she'd be late?

My dad doesn't want me

to have a phone.

She didn't phone the house?

Is he grumpy often?

Has your mother been upset lately?

When your father's been grumpy?

Have you ever seen her cry?

No.

But I saw Daddy cry.

When?

A few nights ago.

He saw me too.

What did he do?

Locked himself in the bathroom.

Where was Mommy

hen he was crying?

She'd gone out

Oh, sh*t.

Yes, is this Filip Becker?

Uh, yeah, I'm gonna

have to call you back.

I better go. Thank you.

He cried last week.

Why did you build

the snowman facing the house?

I didn't build the snowman.

This is Birte Becker.

Please leave a message.

You want a coffee or something?

No.

Look, you're not gonna

try and sleep with me, are you?

No.

Okay, good.

She'll show up.

She's having an affair.

She left her coat and

her handbag in the house.

And the front door was open.

Even if you're having an affair,

you do not leave

your child like that.

And Harry, she's not the only one.

Look, this is Hege Dahl.

Missing two weeks. Similar age.

Young children.

Unhappy marriage.

Talk to the husband.

411 to dispatch.

Dispatch, do you receive?

- Go ahead, 411.

- Now, I'm in Mount Ulriken.

It looks like a homicide.

Uh, adult female.

It's hard to see from here but,

uh, there's a lot of blood.

A group of school

children found her.

I've got a problem.

Rafto just showed up.

What the hell's he doing there?

He's been suspended.

Yeah, try telling him that.

We sent the kids

down with their teacher.

Make sure there's a

care officer to meet them.

And someone to deal with the parents.

One of the children heard a noise

and they went to see what it was.

Listen, John, I'm gonna need you

to calm down. Calm down.

It's important that

you answer my question.

Who's in charge?

Svensson.

Jesus.

It gets worse.

Rafto just arrived.

Perfect.

The drunk and the halfwit.

Just keep them apart, will you?

I'll see what I can do.

Where you going?

Rafto!

Rafto!

- We're closed.

- It's all right.

You have something of mine.

It's not yours.

Cold case.

I have clearance to take it out.

You don't.

So what, you gonna report me?

Eli Kvale.

Tell me.

She was married.

She had three children.

The 12th of November,

six years ago, she went missing.

And the day she vanished,

it was snowing.

Hege Dahl disappeared

the 8th of November.

The day she went missing,

it was snowing.

Not unusual, it's winter.

Now Birte Becker.

And the night she disappeared...

- Snowing.

- Yeah.

I think it's the falling snow

that sets the killer off.

And furthermore, they were married,

they all have children.

Did you talk to Filip Becker?

Nine times out of ten,

the husband did it.

He was interviewed,

and his alibi's solid.

He was 100 miles away.

Have you eaten?

No.

I haven't. I'm hungry.

28th, handball.

Josephine's handball match.

The 3rd, 'F. lunch'.

That's lunch

with her friend, Frida.

I really-I don't see

the point in doing this.

I won't keep you much longer.

9th, Vetlesen.

He's a doctor.

10th, yoga.

Do you have any idea why

your wife went to see him?

Who?

Dr. Vetlesen.

No.

10th, yoga.

Is there any reason

you can think of...

why your wife might

disappear so suddenly?

Your marriage.

Was everything all right?

Were either of you

having an affair?

Daddy!

Come on!

I promised her we'd walk

around the neighborhood

to see if we could

find her mother.

- I'm just getting my jacket, darling.

- Come out!

Dad!

Come inside.

I thought you wouldn't remember.

Is he still giving you a hard time?

If you want, I can talk to him.

Oh!

Just have fun tonight.

He misses you.

Hi, Harry.

Good to see you.

Sorry I'm late, honey.

Have you had anything to eat?

No, I'll...

I'll grab something later.

No, no, but I've got vouchers.

- Yeah?

- Yup.

Hotdog or hotdog?

Well, hotdog then.

Harry?

I'll get something

to eat with Oleg.

So, how are things with you?

- All right.

- Yeah?

A bit tired.

You've been working too hard,

haven't you?

I can't sleep.

You should try Valcetet.

It's a new one.

It'll help you sleep.

I can give you

a prescription right now.

- Really?

- Yeah.

- With that?

- Yeah.

She won't allow me

to try and find my father.

Your mother

should be the judge of that.

She won't listen to me.

She's worried about you.

All she cares about is herself.

All she cares about is you.

That's why she dumped me.

I'm such a bad influence.

She's concerned.

Concerned about what?

The fact that

you'll run away from home.

The fact that

you've been drinking.

So, you're

gonna give me a lecture

about drinking?

Don't be a prick.

Your mom told me

the school's arranged

a father and son

camping trip.

If you want, I can come.

But you're not her

boyfriend anymore.

So?

Yeah. Yeah.

I want you to come.

- You sure?

- Yeah.

Good.

So, what's the... the big surprise?

Eh...

Let's find out.

Someone at work

got me the tickets.

You've got a message.

Let me see what it says.

I've gotta make a call.

Will you stay here?

Harry, there's another missing woman.

In Geilo, this time.

That's not our jurisdiction.

I think we should

have a look at this.

I'm gonna be with you

in two minutes, okay?

Her husband specifically

asked for you.

Hello.

- Hi.

- Oh.

I didn't expect you so early.

- Something came up.

- Oh.

Hi, Harry.

How was the concert?

Yeah, it was-it was great.

We spoke.

I'm taking him on the

father and son camping trip...

thing.

See you.

Hey.

Bye.

Take me home.

We'll go in the morning.

Who reported her missing?

Her husband, last night. 20:05.

Sylvia Ottersen, 33 years old.

Self-employed.

Married twice.

But no children.

Hello?

Hello?

Hello?

- Hi.

- Hi.

Can I help you?

Yeah, well, we're with the

Oslo police.

We got the missing persons call.

Oh. Who's missing?

Sylvia Ottersen.

I'm Sylvia Ottersen.

What? You're Sylvia Ottersen?

Why... why would your husband

report you missing?

I have no idea.

He's not the kind to

play practical jokes.

- Is he here?

- No.

He's gone to the station

to pick up my sister.

Okay.

Well, I guess

it must be a crank call.

We didn't know where you were,

so we had a look inside the house.

I turned your music off.

Sorry about that.

Thank you.

Can I just ask you...

Is it just you and your husband?

Or do you have any children?

No, it's just us.

Okay, thank you.

God, what do you think

you're doing?

You know damn well

what I'm talking about.

Calling the police,

telling them I'm missing?

You think that's funny?

Don't you understand?

It's over.

I don't want to see you again.

No, it wasn't your child.

It was mine.

If you call one more time,

I'm going to the police.

HQ to DC Bratt... DC Bratt?

Yeah, speaking.

We've had a missing persons report.

A woman named Sylvia Ottersen.

Oh, no, she's fine.

W-we just left her.

Well, the call came in

two minutes ago.

Her husband asked specifically

for Inspector Hole.

How could...

Turn the car around.

Sylvia?

Sorry we're back, Mrs. Ottersen.

We just wanted to make sure

you were all right.

I'm Ane Pedersen.

Sylvia's my sister.

We're twins.

Who are you?

- Is that enough?

- Yeah, keep going.

Did you find Hagen?

He's at the dinner

at City Hall.

Keep it clear, if you can.

Well, she always liked men.

Ever since we were teenagers.

She was a good person.

She didn't want to hurt anyone.

It's just the way she was.

I know your sister

didn't have any children.

It was just that there was something

in her reaction that when I asked...

She was pregnant.

She wasn't sure

who the father was.

She got rid of the baby

a few weeks ago.

Ladies and gentlemen,

introducing our guest of honor...

King of industry, philanthropist...

and head of Oslo's Winter Games bid...

Arve Stop.

So lovely for you

to be here for us.

I'm not on the list, but

I know many of these

people are supposed

to be on the list.

I'm the most old friend

of Arve Stop's, you see.

There's been some

kind of misunderstanding.

- I have a person named Vetlesen.

- Come right up, yeah you can come in.

He says he's

a friend of Arve Stop.

No, wait, wait.

No, it's fine, No, just relax.

Just relax.

I wonder, with a dozen companies...

when people ask me why...

I've given up so much

of my time to lead this bid.

I tell them, it's because

I never had these opportunities.

When I was a boy, the only

winter sports I engaged in were...

the uphill snow shovel

and the 50-meter firewood carry.

That is why I believe

passionately...

that this Cup is about

much more than just publicity for our fair city.

Homicides?

Just missing persons for now.

But the pattern is disturbing.

And... I received this.

Prints?

It isn't just the letter.

He reported her missing

before he killed her.

He was watching us

the entire time.

- What do you need?

- Small team.

I'll set up a separate

incident room at the mill.

All right. I don't want a word

of this to be leaked to the...

- To the press.

- the press, yeah.

Not until this f***ing bid is over.

Try to... Just... try to smile.

Smile, it's good.

Does this strike you as the

proper time and place for this?

Wait.

Idiot.

What? Arve?

What? No, don't cry.

Listen, why...

Sh*t.

Hey.

Hey!

Get out.

Get out!

Hey!

Oi! Hey!

Annette Elden, 33, disappeared

12th of December, 2006.

Her head washed

ashore near Arendal.

The rest of the body

never found.

Forensic report indicates

saw marks on her neck.

Status:
Unmarried.

Two children by different fathers.

Harry, I've got the

names and the addresses

of Sylvia Ottersen's boyfriends.

Now, she went to the clinic

the 2nd of November...

but they won't break

patient confidentiality.

They do, however, perform abortions.

What is it?

- Magnus, get me the list.

- What list?

The list of doctors at the Gellion.

I'm thinking that he's going...

- after women that he disapproves of.

- Here.

All the doctors at Gellion

from the last five years.

How did he know?

How did he know

Sylvia Ottersen was pregnant?

Idar Vetlesen.

Birte Becker had an

appointment with the same doctor.

Dr. Idar Vetlesen?

Yes, that's me.

Step in.

Birte Becker and Sylvia Ottersen

were both patients of yours?

Uh, no, they were both

patients at the clinic.

Uh, I never met Sylvia Ottersen.

Can you tell me who treated her?

No, I'm bound

by patient confidentiality.

She's dead.

Oh.

Oh, no.

Wait... well, doctor confidentiality.

In theory, would it be possible for

you to access her medical files?

Even if you didn't

treat her yourself?

Well, in theory, yes.

The doctors at the clinic have

access to the files of every patient...

should they choose to

look at them, which I did not.

What did you see Birte Becker about?

Well, that is uh, confidential.

How do you know Arve Stop?

- Arve?

- Hmm.

Well, I've known Arve for years.

I do research on premature birth.

We have a small charity, and...

Arve Stop is one of

our biggest supporters.

Huh, I wouldn't have thought a man

who goes on so much about family values

would support a clinic

that specializes in abortion.

Well, we specialize

in many different areas.

Hmm.

And Mr. Stop supports our

research in premature birth.

So, do you see each other socially?

Yeah, well, that depends

on how you mean.

It's quite simple, actually.

Do you have friends in common?

Yes, we-we mix in the same circles, so.

W-why are you uh...

To know if you were...

Have you ever practiced in other

parts of the country, Dr. Vetlesen?

Yes, I have in Eidsvoll,

in uh, Lillehammer.

I see you have a picture of

Mon Plaisir pavilion...

- in Bergen.

- Yes, yes, in Bergen.

Do you live alone?

Yes, I uh, I am a reluctant bachelor.

Is there anyone

in the house right now?

Because I thought I saw someone

in the window when I passed.

Well, if you want to take a look around,

I will need to see a search warrant.

In fact, if you don't mind,

I would like to call my lawyer...

before I answer any more

of your questions.

That won't be necessary,

Dr. Vetlesen.

You can bring your lawyer

when we see you next time.

- Hey.

- Hi.

What was that?

- What?

- He isn't a suspect yet.

We needed permission

to search the house.

I know that.

Why'd you ask him

about Arve Stop?

I saw a picture

of them both together.

And?

And it was an innocent question.

Jesus, anyone can see he's

trying to hide something, right?

Cloudberry.

If you hadn't told me

to look out for it,

I'd have assumed she was

attached to his security detail.

Cloudberry?

It's her password.

Does this strike you as the

proper time and place for this?

Arve Stop.

Idiot.

She filmed him at rallies...

at restaurants, at home.

Hi.

Do you want a ride?

No.

Bye.

The 8:
45 train to Bergen

leaving on platform five.

Oh, sorry.

This is the 8:
45

service to Bergen

which stops in Gol,

Finse, Voss and Bergen.

The next station is Gol.

Hi, Harry.

Hi.

Hiding in the playroom, are we?

Yes.

Don't worry,

I'm getting off at the next stop.

Going far?

Bergen.

Ah, rather you than me.

Then again, I'm attending

a three-day conference on

bio-identical hormone restoration.

I thought you were a plastic surgeon?

Well, you know...

Cosmetic surgery needs

to move with the times, too.

We're swapping the scalpel

for hormone replacement therapy.

If you can slow down

the aging process...

there won't be any

need for face-lifts, will there?

I'll bear that in mind.

So, how's the prescription working?

Sleeping like a baby.

Splendid.

So, you, you canceled the Oleg thing?

The school trip?

Weren't you supposed to...

Oh, sh*t.

- Sh*t!

- I'm sorry, Harry, uh...

- I'm sure he's fine.

- Oleg, you coming?

Come on.

He knows how busy you are.

Sh*t.

Look, look, y-you're

not his father, Harry.

What does that mean?

Well, uh...

I don't have to be

his father to care about him.

I'm trying to say that...

it's a big enough responsibility

for a real father, isn't it?

Let alone you and me.

I'm sorry, Harry.

No.

Did you hear from him?

Why can't I go?

Can I go with you?

It's done!

Hi, Oleg, it's Mathias.

You know what, uh, I forgot to

check my messages last night, and...

Harry called to say that

he couldn't make your trip.

No, I know.

No, h-he couldn't get through

to you or you mom, apparently.

No, it's totally my fault, Oleg.

Yes... yes... I'm sorry.

Sorry, Oleg... yes...

Yeah.

So, I'll see you in a few days, then...

when I'm back from the conference.

You didn't have to do that.

Ready? That's it.

Hey, Aasen, someone here

to speak to you.

Aasen.

My family owned

all of these buildings.

And that house over there, too.

Arve Stop worked for us back then.

He was uh, bright, ambitious.

My father really believed in him.

The business wasn't going very well,

so we, uh, offered him a stake.

And within a year,

he had forced us out.

Sold the land for a fortune.

Have any of my colleagues

been in touch with you recently?

A young lady?

No.

I look at this picture now...

See Laila staring at him.

I had no idea at the time.

Family man, eh?

Do you remember the name

of your wife's doctor?

Sure. Morton Freiberg.

Did she... ever see someone

called Vetlesen?

Vetlesen? No.

Dr. Idar Vetlesen.

No.

Any idea where I might find the

officer who's in charge of the case?

Rafto? H-he died.

Yeah, h-he died around

the same time.

Detective Rafto.

Can you connect me

to Haukeland hospital?

What is this?

Am I under arrest?

A cake?

I need some information on a patient.

Laila Aasen.

No, I don't-listen to me.

I don't know the admitting doctor.But perhaps she was there

for an abortion?

Happy birthday to you

Well, then, I'll come down there

with a f***ing warrant myself.

Happy birthday,

dear Swensson

Happy birthday to you

- Rafto?

- Idiot.

Incompetent sons of...

- Oi!

- Rafto?

Rafto!

What's he doing?

Get back.

Get back in. Get back in.

Happy birthday to you

Idiot!

I heard he was a great detective.

He was a suicidal maniac.

They were going to

suspend him, anyway.

They found stuff in his drawers.

Items he'd stolen from

various crime scenes.

Is this him?

Where'd you get this?

From a colleague.

Yes, that's him.

He had this cabin

up on the coast.

He used to get up there

to get smashed.

He was probably drunk

when he shot himself.

They look like coffee beans.

Maybe he was trying

to sober up after all.

You didn't check?

The cabin was locked

from the inside.

And he looked like that

when they found him.

There wasn't anything

to check.

Did he have any family?

Wife who left him a year

before he killed himself. Uh...

I think there was a daughter.

You know where is now?

Not a clue.

Is the cabin still there?

What are you doing to my

f***ing gun, you idiot?

Where's Harry?

In Bergen.

- Hello?

- Mr. Hole?

This is Harry Hole's phone.

Can I speak to him?

He's not here right now, but

I can take the message for him.

Right, okay. Uh, this is Rebecca,

NRS at Telenor.

We picked up a signal from

a missing person's phone.

Case number MP2.

Um, I don't have any files

in front of me. Um, who's that?

I'll check...

Birte Becker.

- Wha... is it transmitting now?

- Yeah.

Just got it in minutes ago.

Yeah, but, w-wait,

is it moving right now?

No.

I'll send you the coordinates.

No, just, w-what's the address?

Uh, Parkway 1, 0139 Oslo.

You sure that's correct?

Yes, Parkway 1.

Hey, are you all right?

This is Birte Becker.

Please leave a message.

Wednesday, unless you...

Yes?

- In his own garage?

- Yeah.

Ah, the great Harry Hole.

How many bodies?

Birte Becker and Ms. Dahl.

Where's Katrine?

Suspended.

She got a call telling her

they traced the Becker phone

and didn't think to tell anyone.

I asked you where she was.

That's not my problem right now.

He shot himself straight on.

How'd he do that with a shotgun?

It's too long, you have to angle it.

Pellet marks should be

up there somewhere.

Luckily, we have experts

to determine that.

You sure he was alone?

The garage door was closed.

One set of footprints.

We found two bodies in the house

and Birte Becker's phone.

It was a suicide.

Case closed.

Mathias, listen,

I have no idea where he's gone.

Yes, I've checked my messages,

he hasn't called.

Oh, well, how can you help?

You're at your bloody conference!

Can I keep this?

Can I keep this?

Yeah, sure.

She's not picking up.

Katrine!

Get off me!

Stop.

I guess congratulations are in order.

You know it wasn't that creep.

Vetlesen didn't commit suicide.

Someone killed him because

we got too close.

Like your father.

My father would never have

committed suicide.

He would never have

left me like that.

Get off me.

Get off me, get off me!

Get off me!

Get off me you f***ing drunk!

Get off.

Get off.

Yeah.

I'm a drunk.

Like your father.

Laila Aasen and Arve Stop

were having an affair...

and that's the last thing my father

was investigating before he got killed.

You broke in to Vetlesen's house

because you were afraid

I'd find out this was personal

and take you off the case.

Vetlesen was his pimp.

And they were both in Bergen

when the murders started.

I know how much you want this,

but you can't force the pieces to fit.

I called the Gellion clinic

and Vetlesen wasn't even working

the day he was supposed

to meet Birte Becker.

They found two dead bodies in his

house and Birte Becker's phone.

Isn't that convenient, then?

So Hagen has his killer

and Arve Stop's safe.

And no questions are asked.

Do you actually think

he killed them?

I don't know.

I don't think either of us

do for sure.

Maybe this will bring your balls back.

I'm gonna need your weapon.

It's right there

in front of you.

Why did he call you Cloudberry?

Because I liked

cloudberry jam with ice cream.

Oleg ran away again.

It doesn't really matter if

we win or lose this bid tonight.

What matters most is that...

we celebrate the way

this has brought us together.

And use that energy to restore

the values that make Noway great.

And so, it doesn't matter if uh...

56 minutes and 33 seconds

from now, but who's counting...

if the World Cup goes to

Beijing or Denver or Montreal.

Because I believe in my heart...

tonight...

Oslo has already won.

I tried calling.

I thought he might be with you.

Oh.

He's okay.

He's uh, he's at a friend's house.

Just didn't bother calling me.

What did you argue about?

He doesn't want to leave the city.

I thought that change

would be good for him.

Well, for me too.

Where?

Um, Mathias has a house uh,

up in Telemark.

And because he consults

all over the place...

it's not too inconvenient.

I saw him the other day,

he didn't mention anything.

Is that really what you want?

I don't know what I want.

I miss you.

My head says 50/50,

but in my heart, 100%.

Thank you for coming.

Mr. Stop?

Mr. Stop, I'm sorry, I um...

I just want to thank you.

I really liked your speech.

I found it very... very moving.

Well, you see, I uh...

I was an orphan myself, so...

Well, it doesn't have to be

a disadvantage, young lady.

It can motivate us, too.

Oh.

Well, yes.

I work in Bergen with-

with young people in a care center

and I know how-

how very busy you are.

But if ever you're

ever in the city...

I started my career in Bergen.

Write to me.

I'll see what I can do.

Yes, I'm so sorry, I know...

I know people are waiting

to talk to you. Thank you.

- Not at all.

- Oh.

Yes.

Mr. Stop wanted me to let you know

how much he enjoyed your conversation.

- Oh.

- It's um, it's room 472.

He'll be free after

the announcement

if there's anything else

you'd like to ask him.

Thank you.

Mathias.

Where are you?

I just tried calling you

on the landline.

I'm at Harry's.

Yeah?

Because I phoned Eric's parents

and Oleg wasn't there either, so...

No, no. I found him.

He was with another friend.

Are you okay?

Yes, I-I'm fine now.

Mathias...

Eh, I've got to run now to one

of those boring dinners, but...

I'll call you in the morning

when I'm back. Okay?

Sh*t.

You couldn't have asked

another doctor?

What?

Two minutes,

ladies and gentlemen.

Hello?

Hello?

And to all our viewers

around the world, thank you...

No. No!

Stop. No!

No!

Of Beijing, Denver, Oslo

and Montreal.

No!

There can only be one winner.

The 15th Winter Sports

World Cup...

has been awarded to...

Two, one...

Oslo.

Oslo! Oslo! Oslo!

Congrats to us all.

Hoo-hoo.

That's the last

of her files to download.

There's nothing after that.

Get me a list of

all the phone calls

and appointments she made while I was away.

Magnus!

Yeah, sure.

When was this taken?

Two days ago.

- No, no. I'm late...

- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

to get her to school.

I have to get to work.

I'm sorry. I have one quick

question I need to ask you.

- We have been over this...

- I know.

hundreds of times.

I know we have been over this

a hundred times,

but I need to sort something out.

Dr. Vetlesen was not

working at the clinic

the day your wife

was supposed to see him.

He wasn't there..

So she got the date wrong.

- How...

- Daddy!

Josephine, in the car.

How the hell am I supposed to

remember what day we saw him?

Sir, I'm just trying to find your wife.

Please help me.

How the hell am I supposed to

remember what day we saw him?

Sir, I'm just trying to find your wife.

Please help me.

How the hell am I supposed to

remember what day we saw him?

Sir, I'm just trying to find your wife.

the hell am I supposed to

remember what day we saw him?

Sir, I'm just trying to find your wife.

- what day we saw him?

- Sir...

- what day we saw him?

- Sir...

Yes, I want all those files.

Give me your car keys.

- What?

- And your phone.

Yes?

You told me Vetlesen was your

wife's doctor when we spoke.

And that you had no idea

why she'd gone to see him.

Yes.

But you told my colleague

you both went to see him.

She must have misheard me.

She recorded the interview.

Darling, go back inside.

I'll come in in a minute, okay?

Good girl.

She isn't mine.

Birte and I were trying

for another child.

We thought it might

save our marriage.

We had blood tests done in the

clinic for hormone treatment.

And it came out that...

she wasn't mine.

I am infertile.

Always been infertile.

Can't have children.

But she is mine.

Do you understand?

How can I not love her?

But you didn't see Vetlesen

the day you found out?

No, we saw some

hormone specialist.

Visiting consultant.

Do you know his name?

Yes?

Just a second.

Damn it.

I said I'm coming.

You never called.

Is Oleg back?

What? Oleg?

He-he's at school.

And Harry?

Is Harry here?

No.

No?

How did he convince you

to give him those pills?

He didn't.

You didn't have to do it for me.

I didn't do it for you.

It was never about you.

I'm outside his house.

I can't reach Rakel.

Send someone to her apartment.

Oleg.

Sorry to keep you waiting.

Why do you have Mom's phone?

Come on.

You and I have more

in common than you think.

I didn't know who

my father was either.

Magnus, track Rakel's phone.

Sorry, I...

All right.

Okay, Harry, we just

picked up a signal.

Heading west towards Telemark.

It is a red Volvo, registered to a

Mathias Lund-Helgesen...

Rjukan, 2421.

The house is pretty remote.

There-there's an access

road, but that's it.

And there's a big

lake around it.

Helicopters are grounded

because of the weather.

But Delta is on their way.

Anything on Mathias' family?

Okay, I've got something here.

Jonas Lund-Helgesen, former

police officer, lost his job in '89.

A scandal involving

a woman drowning in a car.

Probable suicide.

She had a son.

Stop!

Father, unknown.

Please!

He was sent to an orphanage.

Who led the investigation

into the woman's disappearance?

Some local talent in village nearby.

What's his name?

Jonas Lund-Helgesen.

Jonas. No.

Please, stop!

Harry?

Harry!

We've lost him.

Sit down, Harry.

Pass me the gun.

I didn't think you'd find me.

Perhaps the pills helped after all.

I spoke to Filip Becker.

What's going to happen

when Josephine Becker finds out

he isn't her father?

She'll still love him.

Wrong answer.

Let's try again.

Was it right for Sylvia Ottersen

to kill her unborn child...

simply because she couldn't

keep track of who the father was?

That was her choice.

Too short.

Maybe she was afraid.

What about you, Harry?

You have a woman who loves you.

A boy who's devoted to you.

Why did you abandon them?

They deserve better.

Too easy.

Because I'm selfish.

I'm an addict.

There isn't enough room for them.

You know, when I first saw

your picture in the papers...

with all those medals...

I thought, "That man

must have a perfect family."

And here you are.

Last question.

This boy...

who doesn't even know

who his father is...

who's had to put up with

so many men like you and me...

taking his place.

Does his mother deserve to live?

Why don't you ask him?

You all right?

Kill him.

Kill him.

Kill him!

Come on!

I'm ready!

I'm here!

Come on!

I know why you blame her.

You've been wrong

the whole time.

It wasn't her.

It wasn't you mother

who didn't want you.

It was your father.

It would have been better for him...

had you not been born.

The pathologist detected traces

of the drug ketanome.

And the direct cause of death

was drowning...

as the result of blood

filling her lungs.

24 stab wounds were found

in her mouth...

all at regular intervals...

and at the same depth:

seven centimeters.

The pathologist can't determine

what kind of weapon was used.

And he's never seen

anything like it.

I'll take it.
