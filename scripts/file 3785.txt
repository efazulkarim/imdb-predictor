I'll take a look now.

It rattled the whole system.

We're trying to

get a handle on

what happened.

The entire network

Yeah. End to end.

Thankfully,

You're in

Yeah. She seemed to be

Well, there's nothing

Enough about her.

I wanna know what happened

to you on MB-418.

MONICA: Yes, sir. Uh...

Let me preface this

by saying I'm not

really sure. But...

I did not break

my closet  door, okay?

I was in space.

Oh, so it broke itself?

No, no, no, no, no.

See, I disappeared.

So maybe

Captain Marvel broke it.

What?

Yes,

your friend,

Captain Marvel.

She was walking up and down

our living room,

and now you come back,

waltzing in

with no apologies.

I'm sorry, Captain Marvel

was in our house?

Is Captain Marvel

pressuring you

in any way?

Look, I understand that

she's an important figure

and all that, but you don't

have to do as she says.

This is not what

Supremor Dar-Benn.

The Skrull

have been scattered

to every corner

of the universe.

Made refugees

wherever we go,

and still,

we came into

these negotiations

in good faith.

I hear you, Dro'ge.

I, perhaps

more than anyone,

understand what

you and your people

have been through.

After my predecessor

was destroyed,

heretics rose up

to fill the void.

The Civil w*r

has polluted our skies.

My people cannot breathe.

Our sun is dying.

Hala is out of time.

I hope we can

rebuild together.

So much so

that I'm willing to put

our ancient animosities

behind us.

And give you a chance

to protect your people.

To stop running.

The Skrull will take

their rightful place

in the Kree Empire.

And I will aid

in their relocation.

I don't know

And then this

freaking cat ate a man.

How can a cat

eat a man, Kamala?

I don't know.

It has tentacles

and it ate a man.

What tentacles, Kamala?

I don't know.

Where are

The Kree jury-rigged

a wormhole on MB-418.

You mean

like a jump point?

I don't know.

But I touched it

and then I...

Why'd you do that?

Because it was glowing

and mysterious.

Okay, new rule,

no more touching sh*t.

Especially glowing,

mysterious sh*t.

Okay, I'm feeling

a lot of negative

energy from you

and I don't like it.

That's not the point.

The point is, is that it was

siphoning off the atmosphere.

And it did this!

that went around my hand.

Sorry.

"Hard Light powers," yes.

"Noor..."

Okay,

but why do you have

intel on her?

Is there some sort

of surveillance on us?

"Surveillance"

is a strong word.

Well, ma'am,

your daughter is

the hero that

saved Jersey City.

So, of course

we would have intel

on someone like her.

And you're also

electromagnetically

altered.

(FURY CLICKS TONGUE)

YUSUF: What does that mean?

(GOOSE PURRS)

MONICA: Oh, it just means

that we both have

light-based powers.

What's your...

What's your code name?

Oh, I don't have

a code name.

(LAUGHS)

We'll workshop it.

No, thank you.

Aunt Carol... Mmm.

Captain Marvel also

has light-based powers.

It's probably

not a coincidence.

Not to mention

the two of you came

into direct contact

with some malfunctioning

jump points.

I still cannot believe

that Captain Marvel was here

and I didn't even

get to meet her.

You know,

we're supposed to be all,

like, "twinsies!"

you know.

We have the same name.

I would obviously, then...

I don't know,

I would just

give her the letter

that I wrote for her

and we would go out for lunch,

and then it would just...

Did you say "Aunt Carol?"

(SMACKS LIPS) I said

that Captain Marvel

can absorb light energy.

I can see it.

And you,

you can turn light

into physical matter.

(CHUCKLES)

never heard of.

But my working theory...

I could totally show you.

YUSUF: Hmm.

Uh, Monica,

you wanna fill Carol in

on your working theory?

Yeah. Um...

Hi, Captain Marvel.

It is so good to see you,

Lieutenant Trouble.

You too.

And it's

Captain Rambeau now.

Right. Sorry.

So, what's new?

Where's my sister?

Yeah.

I'm thinking that

our joint exposure

to these unsteady jump points

and our susceptibility

to electromagnetic energy

has temporarily entangled

our world-lines.

Yeah, that,

right there.

YUSUF: Uh...

Entanglement.

Our light powers

are entangled.

So, we switch places

whenever we use them

at the same time.

Which would mean Kamala...

When did you get powers?

I walked through

a radiation shielding barrier

of a witch hex and now

I can manipulate and see

all wavelengths of

the electromagnetic spectrum.

I'm very happy for you.

Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

(YUSUF MUTTERS QUIETLY)

Where's our daughter?

Yes, please.

I, um...

I'm really sorry

for the way

I spoke to you.

Thank you.

I know that this

situation isn't ideal,

but it is actually nice

having people

on board again.

It gets pretty

lonely out here.

Anytime you need company,

I will be there.

I will drop everything.

I will...

I will drop high school.

Don't do that.

But can we start again?

Hi, I'm Carol Danvers.

I am Kamala Khan.

But when I'm fighting crime

on the streets of Jersey City,

I go by Ms. Marvel,

and I hope that's okay,

like, copyright-wise.

Because, honestly,

I never thought

I'd ever get to meet you.

But now that it's happening

and we're, like,

touching each other...

I've realized I should

have asked permission.

So,

twinsies.

Okay. All right.

(CHUCKLES)

Here's what

we're gonna do.

Captain Marvel.

You need to stop

calling me that.

I used to change

your diapers.

Oh, that was once.

And then I was told

you proceeded to

vomit everywhere.

First of all, it's my ship,

so I make the game plan.

Oh, I'm sorry.

When's the last time

you led a team?

As early as last week.

Goose doesn't count.

Please. You try giving

Goose orders.

Oh, my God, we're a team?

CAROL: We're not...

Oh, no, no, no,

we're not a team.

We're not a team.

(GASPS) I, Kamala Khan

of Jersey City,

am on a team

with Captain Marvel

and Captain Monica Rambeau,

who from this point onwards

will now be known as...

Professor Marvel.

CAROL: Oh!

Professor Marvel.

No. No, no, she...

(CHUCKLES)

she will not.

But thank you.

The Marvels.

Now that we've got that

out of the way, team,

I've been trying to tell you,

I think I know

how she's making

the weird jump points.

She has one of these.

It's my nani's bangle.

It started glowing

really weirdly

when Dar-Benn opened

that first jump point. Also,

it once traveled me

through space and time,

so that's probably related.

What you're describing

is a Quantum Band.

I mean, I knew

there were two of these.

I just did not expect

the other one to be in space.

They're a pair? How do

you have a Quantum Band?

Okay. What is

a Quantum Band?

A myth.

Or I thought

it was a myth.

It's an ancient artifact.

(INTRIGUING MUSIC PLAYING)

So this is what

Dar-Benn found on MB-418.

And then her and Kamala

just happened to stumble

into each other?

I mean,

what are the chances?

"What you seek

is seeking you."

It's inscribed

on the bangle.

If the Kree

legends are true,

the Quantum Bands

were used to create

every jump point

in the universe.

Teleportation network.

Two Quantum Bands

working in unison

to connect the galaxy.

So that would explain

our switch-y

entanglement situation.

Yeah, yeah, but

Dar-Benn only has one.

She must be

overloading it

with the energy

from her space

hammer thingy.

It's called

the Universal w*apon.

Oh, really?

I was gonna

call it Cosmi-Rod.

Either way,

she's using it to force

unstable jump points

into the grid.

We have got to

get to her before

she makes another one.

She had star charts

and maps on the screens

on her ship.

Okay. To where?

To the stars?

Okay.

It's fine. Got a plan.

We will use this.

KAMALA: Is that...?

A Skrull t*rture device.

And, wait, we put it

on our heads?

Yes, it's fine.

You use it to

access memories.

I've been using it

to regain the memories

that the Kree took from me.

Still?

Yeah.

But, you know,

it has a lot

of other uses.

(DEVICE TRILLS)

It's safe.

You might wanna

get comfortable.

(DEVICES TRILL)

(DEVICES CHIME)

KAMALA: Whoa! This is weird.

MONICA: Wait. Go back.

Her band absorbs your energy

and redirects it.

It's like you gave her power

to use against you.

CAROL: Kamala?

KAMALA: Hmm. What about this?

MONICA: There!

Those coordinates.

Can you read that?

CAROL: Yes.

The Magellanic Galaxy.

(YOUNG MONICA GIGGLES)

All right,

the pilot seat's all you.

KAMALA: Is that you, Monica?

You're so cute!

CAROL: No, wait.

MONICA: Carol,

what are you doing?

CAROL: Why'd you ask me

to come, Maria?

MONICA: Mom.

(SIGHS HEAVILY)

The cancer's back.

So I need you

to take care of Goose.

No.

What do you mean "no?"

No, I mean,

you beat it once.

You'll beat it again.

Carol...

I'm not taking the cat.

It's not a cat.

It should've been

you that day.

That stupid race

to the hangar.

I never wanted

to be Captain Marvel.

Captain Rambeau

suits me just fine.

And it's just until

Monica gets back.

She blipped.

MONICA: Carol, I don't

wanna relive this.

CAROL: I'm sorry.

(DISTORTED BLAST)

MONICA: Stop now,

please, Carol!

Remember why

you're out there.

I'm looking for

a patient in room 104.

NURSE: I don't know.

I don't know what to tell you.

And remember to come home.

DR. HARLEY: Your mom,

she died, honey.

No. No, no, no! (WINCES)

(ALL PANTING)

Never do that again.

I'm sorry.

It wasn't on purpose.

Wait, so your mom...

Passed away

while I was blipped.

And when I came back,

no one was there.

Okay.

(SENTIMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)

(CHUCKLES) Thank you.

She seemed really cool.

I'm sorry.

She was.

She was the best.

Well, we have to make do

with what we know right now.

MONICA: Here is

what we do know.

The Universal Neural

Teleportation Network

is a system of wormholes

through the

space-time continuum

aka, jump points,

which allows us to

hop between different

planetary systems.

Basically, it stretches

and reconfigures space

without rupturing

the continuum.

Like fracking,

the more holes you drill,

the more destabilized

the shale becomes,

and then... earthquake.

Bottom line, if she

keeps creating

these jump points,

it's gonna get really bad,

really fast.

Question is,

what does she want?

Tarnax used to be

occupied by the Kree,

so maybe the attack

was a warning?

So, she could be after

another former colony?

Is there

a former Kree colony

in the Magellanic?

CAROL: At one point,

the Kree colonized

25% of the galaxy, so...

If all she wanted

was to destroy Tarnax,

why not bring in an army

or use a b*mb or something?

Why a jump point?

You're right.

Jump points

aren't weapons,

they're means

of transportation.

Every jump point

has two sides,

so if Tarnax's atmosphere

was siphoned away,

it had to go

somewhere, or...

Hala.

The Kree Civil w*r

basically bankrupted Hala

of its natural resources.

The air is barely breathable,

they're suffering

from a drought.

KAMALA: A drought?

So, she could be

after water next.

Okay. Where in

the Magellanic

can we find...

Aladna.

Oceans cover 99.63%

of the planet.

That is a very

specific stat.

You've been there.

Yeah.

Uh... Uh, yeah.

She said that

really weird.

Yeah. Why are

you being weird?

Okay. Consensus

on Aladna. (SIGHS)

Aye.

MONICA: Yeah,

I say we do it.

Get to Aladna

and separate Dar-Benn

from that bangle.

We have our heading.

Kamala, you are not going

on any space adventures.

Nicholas has told me

how dangerous they can be.

It's just "Fury." God.

Wait. Where are you guys?

Where is Abu?

(IN URDU)

So that means I'm the devil?

Really, Fury?

They insisted,

and your dad is

not adjusting very well

to space travel.

Hey, babe, so I'm in

this crazy space elevator

and we're going up.

Or maybe we're

going down. Uh...

Are there directions

in space?

FURY: Yes, there are.

But no filming.

Oh. Okay.

(MOUTHING) Help me.

(GOOSE MEOWS)

Whoa.

(YUSUF EXCLAIMS IN URDU)

(CAPTIVATING MUSIC PLAYING)

CAROL: Fury, everything okay?

We've had another surge.

Reports are coming in

across the network.

It seems everyone's

been affected.

MONICA: Well, we need to stop

her from making another one,

and we can't risk

intergalactic body swapping

in the meantime.

CAROL: Mrs. Khan, I'm sorry,

but your daughter will have

to stay aboard my ship

until we can get

to the bottom of this.

MUNEEBA: Oh, no, no, no.

KAMALA: Yes!

You will let her go.

Mrs. Khan, uh,

it is not that simple.

We need Kamala.

Ammi, we found

Nani's other bangle,

and there's this

weirdly beautiful

but kind of terrifying woman

using the other one

to hurt people.

And we have to stop her.

You're telling me

there's another bangle.

And they're going to use

that bangle to hurt you?

Monica will take

care of her.

We will.

And we will make sure

she gets back home

in one piece.

I promise.

Stay the course.

We'll figure out

how to close

those jump points.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

Kamala, you listen to me.

If anything happens to you,

(IN URDU)

You tell her that.

(MUNEEBA SNIFFLES)

(VOICE QUIVERS)

I love you, beta.

I love you more.

CAROL: Wait,

what did she just say?

Nothing.

Nobody cares more

than Captain Marvel,

and nobody gets

more grief for it.

Trust me.

Kamala is in good hands

with Carol.

(GAGGING)

What's wrong with that cat?

It's acting very weird.

Also, Mr. Fury,

she's looking little pudgy.

I think

you're overfeeding her.

Goose.

Goose!

KAMALA: Firefly?

Night Light.

Countess Marvel.

Mistress Marvel?

Doctor Marvel?

MONICA: That's too much.

Doctor Bright.

Mmm... Professor Marvel.

Nova,

Supernova Girl...

Spectrum,

Spectrum-Vision.

You're doing too much.

Vision! Oh, wait.

No. Sorry.

How many times do I

have to tell you guys,

I do not want

or need a code name?

Why?

Besides, none of it matters

if we're not coordinated

out there.

CAROL: Wanna figure out

the switching thing?

Powers stay activated

after a switch.

Good to know.

Okay, everyone

together on three.

Ready? One,

two, three, go.

Now, why would you

say "go" if we're

going on three?

I'm aware.

(INTERGALACTIC

BY BEASTIE BOYS PLAYING)

Now.

Now.

Now.

One, two, three!

She gave me eyes.

Now. Now.

Can you hold on

for one second?

Walk. And switch!

Ooh!

Switch!

(KAMALA LAUGHS)

Oh, oh, oh.

Hey, I got this!

(CAROL GROANS)

(INTERGALACTIC BY BEASTIE BOYS

CONTINUES PLAYING)

MONICA: Yes!

(MONICA SHOUTS RHYTHMICALLY)

And switch!

YUSUF: That's why you wanna

invest in index funds

rather than

in individual stocks.

Of course,

both a Roth IRA and 401k

are important

for tax purposes.

You know, I never

even thought about

planning for retirement.

Hey, it's never

too late.

And it's never

too early,

like I say.

(BOTH LAUGH)

How old are you?

Huh?

Wow. Same age.

(LOUD WHOOSHING AND THRUMMING)

YUSUF: Ya Allah!

What was that?

I'm gonna find out.

Please.

AUTOMATED VOICE:

Sweet Svartalfheim.

Don't touch it.

What is it?

I haven't

the foggiest idea.

How did it

get in there?

I don't know.

Should we tell Fury?

NAVIGATION VOICE:

Twenty seconds

to the jump point.

KAMALA: Do you guys realize

how crazy this is right now?

Like, I'm in a spaceship

with two superheroes.

Also, is it too late

to go to the bathroom?

Because I feel like

it's gonna hit really soon.

No one would believe me.

Like my...

Nakia, she would

never... Whoa!

(ENGINE HUMMING)

(THRILLING MUSIC PLAYING)

(HEROIC MUSIC PLAYING)

(HEROIC MUSIC CONTINUES)

Okay. Here we go. Comms.

Wow!

I've always wanted

one of these.

Thank you.

(LOUDLY) Testing.

Testing, one, two, three.

Kamala. Kamala.

We hear you, baby.

Thank you.

So, uh, real quick

before we get sucked in...

What the hell

is that?

I should warn you that

I'm kind of famous here.

Well, you do know

you're famous

everywhere, right?

This one's kinda different.

I helped the prince

with a legal issue.

Okay.

Mmm-hmm. Let's go.

No matter what,

follow my lead.

Aladnean culture

is very specific.

So, there's gonna be a bit

of a ceremony we have to do,

but just... stay cool.

(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

Fair Aladna

It's a peaceful crossroads

Diamond of the quadrant

Aladna, our home

Hi, small child,

could you tell...

WOMAN 1:

Fair Aladna

As if no time has passed

So excited

that you're home

ALADNEANS:

Our princess is home

Princess?

(ALADNEANS VOCALIZE)

What is happening?

Their language is Song.

Most of them won't

understand you

unless you sing. Come on.

Why aren't

you guys dancing?

I am dancing.

KAMALA:

Oh, we're almost there.

How angelic.

Hi... Okay.

All right.

Wow. (PANTING)

(MUSIC AND SINGING CONTINUE)

Oh, my gosh,

give me some of

what they're having.

(CAROL AND MONICA SIGH)

If you tell

anyone about...

What?

That you're a pretty,

pretty princess?

(LAUGHS)

MONICA: So, that's

what you meant

when you said "legal issue."

Mmm. It is a marriage

of convenience.

It's more of

a diplomatic act,

you know?

It's like, there was

a power struggle.

Matriarchal society.

We are friends.

MONICA: Mmm-hmm.

It's a long story.

Maybe you could sing it.

Maybe not.

Mmm, we're here.

(ENTHRALLING MUSIC PLAYS)

(WHISPERS)

I'm feeling so many

Oh, Aladna's

Invite her down

put her feet on the ground

Give me a chance here

before it gets too messy

So lead the wolf

inside our walls

And trust that you alone

Can stop an army?

Have I ever let you down?

How many chapters

of your Captain Marvel

fan fiction is this giving you?

CAROL: I'm not

about to start

KAMALA: So many.

And don't forget

CROWD: Don't forget

I'm not alone

Yeah, he's bilingual.

We are severely

underdressed.

But could you get us

something a little more

battle-ready?

Of course.

BOTH: Thank you.

Theories so far?

DAG: At best,

a one-off pest problem.

At worst, an enemy plant.

Some kinda infestation

bioweapon.

Or it could be from

a traitor from within.

Well, let's not

go there yet.

let's just continue

to be like me.

I messed this whole thing up.

KAMALA:

If we weren't entangled,

if we weren't here,

then you could have

beat Dar-Benn.

And I'm sorry.

No, you don't understand.

The Kree had been ruled

by an AI for a millennia

that led them into a w*r.

And I thought the only way

to stop it was to destroy it.

But I just

made it worse.

(VOICE QUIVERING)

I'm the reason why

the civil w*r started

in the first place.

I'm the reason why

they couldn't breathe the air.

That's how I got

the name Annihilator.

you to see that

you never came back?

I thought if I fixed it,

then I could come home.

you're here now.

And you, too.

at the beginning.

I did not give you

a lot of space

to be a real person.

(ELECTRICITY SURGING)

CONTINUES PLAYING)

Guys, I found her.

(FLERKEN MEOWS)

Come on. Come on, move.

YUSUF: Hey! Come on.

Come on, come here.

Whoa!

MUNEEBA: Go, go, go.

YUSUF: Come on, come on.

Go to the spacecraft bay.

Okay. Come on. Chalo, Chalo.

Come on.

Yusuf, stop with your belt.

(FLERKEN YELPS)

(WHOOSHING)

(MEOWS)

DAG: Nope. No.

No, no, no.

Thank you. No.

MUNEEBA: Come, come, come.

(MEMORY BY BARBRA STREISAND

CONTINUES PLAYING)

(FLERKENS YOWL)

Don't you worry, little one.

Here, go to Kamala.

Go to Kamala.

There you go, come, come.

MONICA: I found Dar-Benn.

What?

She wants our sun.

(RUMBLING)

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

(CRACKLING)

AAMIR: You leavin' again?

Yeah.

Ammi, the universe

isn't safe.

And if the universe

isn't safe,

that means

you guys aren't safe.

And if you guys aren't...

(MUNEEBA SHUSHES)

Listen to me.

You are chosen

for a greater purpose,

okay?

So, of course

you must go now.

(TEARFULLY)

But I will never

let you go.

You understand

that, right?

(WELL-WISHING IN URDU)

Yeah.

Come back safely, beta.

You better.

I don't wanna be

an only child.

Not again.

Not with these two.

You think it's wise taking

that bangle to the bad guy?

Yes. Mr. Fury's right.

Give it to me.

I will take it home.

Dar-Benn's opened

another jump point,

and we're gonna need

both bangles to close it.

Then I guess

you'd better

make damn sure

she doesn't get

her hands on it.

Understood.

(HEROIC MUSIC PLAYING)

(WHOOSHING)

(ALL SCREAMING)

MUNEEBA: Oh, God, Mr. Fury,

you are going

in the wrong direction!

Mrs. Khan, I know!

(ALL SCREAM)

YUSUF: You did it, Mr. Fury!

FURY: I didn't do anything.

(MUNEEBA SCREAMS)

(AAMIR CHANTING

CREED IN ARABIC)

Are you praying?

Don't stop! We need

all the help we can get!

(RESUMES CHANTING IN ARABIC)

Amen!

Amen!

Holy cow!

(FLERKENS RETCHING)

Mr. Fury!

Whoa!

(SIGHS)

DAR-BENN: There she is,

the Annihilator herself.

It's over, Dar-Benn.

No, not yet.

I know that you would do

anything to protect Hala.

This will be the end

of the Kree.

It will be the end

of everything.

You took from me.

I'm simply repaying

the favor.

Now, give me

the band.

You're forgetting something.

What?

Me.

(GRUNTS)

(DAR-BENN GROANS)

(SNIFFS, GRUNTS SOFTLY)

This could have been

so much easier.

I don't know.

I like our odds.

(GRUNTING)

(STRAINING)

(LAUGHING)

(ALL GRUNTING)

(PANTING)

(GRUNTS, SCREAMS)

(PANTING)

(GROANING)

You're living up

to your name again.

I didn't want this.

Death seems to follow you.

(DAR-BENN WHIMPERING)

It doesn't have to end

like this, Dar-Benn.

Please, just give us

the bangle.

I won't!

Hala's sun died

because of you.

Why shouldn't

you repay us?

Maybe she should.

The reaction

in your sun's core

has slowed.

It needs an

incredible amount of

energy to jump-start it,

and that's what

you have, Carol.

You can use your powers

to save Hala.

But I've never

done anything

like that before.

In the last

couple of days,

I have done

a lot of things I have

never done before.

You got this.

(BREATH SHUDDERS)

For Hala.

For Hala.

(GROANING)

(GRUNTING)

(SCREAMS)

Try anything

and I'll k*ll her faster

than you can move.

(SCREAMS) Carol!

(MS. MARVEL CRYING)

No!

(GRUNTS)

(FOREBODING MUSIC PLAYING)

(EXHALES)

(BAND WHIRRS)

CAPTAIN MARVEL:

You won't survive this.

Dar-Benn,

listen to me.

(BOTH GRUNTING)

(INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING)

(BOTH STRAINING)

(SCREAMING)

(GRUNTS)

(MUFFLED RUMBLING)

Are you okay?

Yeah.

I didn't switch.

One, two, three.

(CRACKLING)

(GROANING)

KAMALA: I'm so glad

you're okay.

You got the bangles.

We're gonna

need those.

(CAROL SIGHS)

Ooh... (SIGHS)

MONICA: Okay,

come on, Princess.

CAROL: So, what

are we looking at?

A self-propagating

singularity with

negative mass

and non-Newtonian

topology.

She tore a hole

in space-time.

(CRACKLING)

That is

a different reality

bleeding into ours.

Can we even fix that?

In theory, you and Carol

can reproduce

the same amount of energy

that was used to open it.

I will absorb it

and then release it,

but from inside the tear.

But what about

the switching?

Our, um, powers

aren't entangled anymore.

Oh.

Well, that's

a good thing, I guess.

But, wait. You want

us to blast you

with the same

amount of power

that punched a hole

in the fabric

of space-time?

If we wanna

un-punch it, yeah.

Monica...

You're gonna need this.

(EXHALES)

(BANDS WHIRRING)

How are you feeling,

Ms. Marvel?

These bangles traveled

through space and time.

To find me.

(EXHALES)

I was born for this.

(ENERGY SURGING)

It has to be now.

(BREATHES HEAVILY)

Bismillaah.

(SCREAMING)

It's closing, Monica.

You've got to

get out of there.

(GASPING)

I can't leave, Carol.

CAROL: What?

What do you mean?

I can't leave.

I have to

finish the job.

No! Monica, it's closing.

You'll be trapped!

It's okay.

(GRUNTS)

(MONICA CRIES OUT)

(GASPING)

(WHIMPERS)

Come on.

Always knew

I would have to stay.

(KAMALA SOBBING SOFTLY)

(PENSIVE MUSIC PLAYING)

(DISTANT WHOOSH)

Ka... Kamala. Beta.

Kamala, you saved

the world.

(FLERKENS MEOWING)

Why are you crying?

Beta?

Why are you crying?

What happened?

We lost Monica.

(SIGHS)

She got stuck

on the other side.

And Carol?

KAMALA: She went

to fulfill a promise.

(PENSIVE MUSIC CONTINUES)

(BLASTING)

(MUFFLED expl*si*n)

(HOPEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)

How are things?

The planets are expected

to make a full recovery.

And a team of scientists

are being sent to Hala

to try and help their people.

That's not what I meant.

(SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING)

(SIGHS)

(CHUCKLES)

This says "Kitchen,"

but there are all these

hot sauce packets...

And then there's this

very bizarre-looking tray,

which I will say is

a very good quality,

though.

Oof. You can keep it.

Oh, no, no,

Carol, I just...

AAMIR: Where else

would they go?

YUSUF: Oh, yeah, yeah,

it was for me.

The vastness of it

just gives you

a whole new

perspective on life.

Yeah, it does,

doesn't it?

And it was

surprisingly cool.

(SIGHS) This place

is amazing.

Yeah, it is.

Hey, do you still

fly that thing?

You wanna

check it out?

I do.

All right.

(CHUCKLES)

Hey, wait, wait, wait.

Come here. Come here.

Come here. Come here.

Oh, I'm so happy that

you're home safe, beta.

Okay.

(CHUCKLES)

Aamir,

this would be

a lovely house

to raise a family in,

you know?

(CLICKING REMOTE BUTTON)

Aamir.

This is so cool.

(CHUCKLES)

Pilot seat's

all you.

(GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING)

Let's fly this thing.

I actually don't

have the key.

I'm just looking

after it.

Just until

Monica gets back?

Yeah.

Just until

Monica gets back.

KAMALA: I really miss her.

We were good together.

(CAROL CHUCKLES)

Which got me thinking...

(HEROIC MUSIC PLAYS)

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

(KEYS JINGLING)

(DOOR UNLOCKS)

FEMALE VOICE:

Pizza delivery.

(CHUCKLES)

Whew!

(EXHALES) Okay.

(DRAMATIC MUSICAL STING)

Can I help you?

Kate Bishop.

Did you think you're the only

kid superhero in the world?

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

Well, I'm 23.

Oh, I know.

I've been

reading up on you.

Where did

you get that?

I found it

in my couch.

Okay.

You've just become

part of a much

larger universe.

Which, at the moment,

is just me, mostly.

I do have

feelers out, though.

Did you know Ant-Man

had a daughter?

What do you want?

I'm putting

together a team.

And I want you on it.

(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)

Hmm.

(SMACKS LIPS)

(MUSIC FADES OUT)

Please?

(MACHINES THRUMMING)

(INHALES SHARPLY)

(GROANS)

(GASPING)

Mom?

(VOICE TREMBLING) Mom?

(TEARFULLY) Mom!

"Mom"?

(VOICE CRACKING)

I've missed you so much!

You missed me?

I'm so sorry. I'm... I'm...

Okay. Okay. Okay, okay.

Hey, hey, look at me.

It's okay. You're okay.

(DOOR OPENS)

Hey.

(MONICA CRYING)

DOCTOR: How's our

mysterious visitor?

She seems

a little disoriented.

Where... Where are we?

What happened?

We were hoping

you could tell us.

All we know is that

Binary found you.

My theory? You somehow

crossed through a tear

in space-time.

You are now in a reality

parallel to your own.

Which is, of course,

impossible.

MARIA: I think

there might be a little

confusion happening.

Confusion is

but the first step

on the journey

to knowledge.

Okay. I'll take it

from here.

BEAST: Charles asked

for an update.

I'll come by

and check on you later.

(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)

Who are you?

Oh, sh*t.
