(ELECTRICITY CRACKLES)

MAN: The entire world

is a collection of memoranda

that she did exist,

and that I have lost her.

Whatever our souls are made of,

hers and mine are the same.

A rather pretentious way

to open our story...

but I've always

had a flair for the dramatic.

You see, this is our story...

Tessa's and mine.

It's a story

you've heard before,

passed down from the Greeks,

through Shakespeare,

the Brontes, Jane Austen.

It's the story of a young girl

exploring her independence,

free from the bonds

of her oppressive parent...

and promised to a boy

she clearly does not love.

She meets a dashingly

handsome young man

who sweeps her off her feet...

even though he represents

everything she detests.

She falls for him,

gives herself to him,

and is ultimately

betrayed by him

and left shattered.

Only it is he who is

destroyed by his deceit.

When it feels as though

all is lost,

the two reunite

and live happily ever after.

Like I've said,

a story you've heard before.

Only difference is...

this isn't that story.

(TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING)

(SIGHS)

I'm not naive

I know how people can be

We're leavers,

cheaters, liars

That make you believe

None of us are saints

I guess

we're all the same...

Hey. Can I ask you a question?

- Piss off.

- I'm looking for someone.

Piss off!

...supposed to be different

And darling

You

Were supposed

To be different

Whoo! Sure don't seem

like Christmas out here,

all this heat we've been havin'.

Ya know, I hate the heat.

Heat make people

do some crazy things.

Hoo!

Thank... Thank you!

Sorry.

Excuse me! Sir, can you

hold that elevator, please!

Asswipe!

Thank you.

Did you call me an asswipe?

Excuse me?

You just called me an asswipe.

Um, no. I didn't.

Yeah, I guess

I just imagined it.

Guess so.

Ya know, I was trying

to hold the elevator for you.

Sure you were.

Look, I'm sorry.

It's my first day.

I'm just trying

to make an impression.

Well, you certainly

succeeded at that.

(SOFTLY)

Asswipe.

(OFFICE CHATTER)

Man: No, no, no, no...

- You work here?

- Surprise.

WOMAN: Tessa!

Welcome to Vance Publishing.

Hi. Kimberly, right?

Excellent memory.

I'm impressed.

Yes, she makes

quite the impression.

You two know each other?

Uh... we're old friends.

Now, if you ladies

will excuse me?

- Are you excited to get going?

- Yeah.

Let's introduce you to the boss.

Shut the f*ck up

and listen to me!

This might not be

the best time for introductions.

Why don't I

show you your office?

Trevor!

On it.

I apologize for the mess.

We've been short

on interns lately,

and we're a bit backlogged.

That seems crazy to me.

People I know would k*ll

for an internship here.

I know, it's just that Vance

has this small problem with

firing them after a day.

But that's not

going to happen to you.

I have a good feeling

about this.

But like I said

during the interview,

your job is to read

five manuscripts a week,

and if you like them,

just forward them on to me.

- Okay.

- The kitchen is right down the hall.

Feel free to place

any order for lunch.

- Any questions?

- Uh, no. I'm good.

You got this.

(GRUNTS)

(SIGHS) Mmm.

Mr. Vance!

Um... Um, I'm so sorry.

I must have dozed off.

- What time is it?

- 9:25.

9:25?

- Am I fired?

- Sit down.

You mean to tell me

you read three books

and did coverage

on all of them last night,

and you think Carnival of Light

by Niko Tanaka is a great read?

Yeah, it is. It's, uh,

she has a really original voice,

it's a lot like

an early Margaret Atwood,

- (CELL PHONE CHIMING)

- The Edible Woman,

- Surfacing...

- I'm coming down now.

Grab your things.

Come with me.

(SOFTLY) Oh, sh*t.

Man: Morning, Mr. Vance.

- Morning, sir.

- Mr. Vance, I was just...

I was wondering if we had time

to go back to...

Get in.

Because I have to get

my phone charger in at...

Oh, we're closing the door!

(WHISPERS)

Little work tip.

- Hmm?

- It helps if you don't wear the same clothes every day.

That, and showering.

(ENGINE STARTS)

Um, where are we going?

There's a digital

publishing conference,

and I need to secure

some funding for my expansion.

Woman: f*ck off!

What part of "We're closed"

don't...

- Hi.

- You busy?

Kind of in the middle

of something.

So, you know, why don't you

come back tomorrow?

Or just come in right now.

I'm good.

Come on, it'll ease the pain.

I like the pain.

Well, suit yourself,

you f*ckin' masochist.

Welcome back the Montgomery,

Mr. Vance.

I have your rooms ready for you.

We had a printer delivered

to Mr. Trevor Matthews' room.

Unfortunately, Ms.

Young's room wasn't ready,

so we had her upgraded to a suite

with compliments of the management.

Has Mr. Jiang checked in yet?

I do believe he's at the bar.

Of course he is.

So I get a printer

and you get a suite.

You're enjoying this,

aren't you?

Definitely.

Hon', do you mind

taking Tessa shopping?

She needs something for tonight.

I trust you.

Let's go have some fun.

Are you sure that I can get in?

Because I've never been

to a nightclub before.

But don't they check...?

You'll be with us.

It won't be a problem.

Look, before we go outside,

I just wanted

to tell you something.

Okay.

Vance and I are...

more than co-workers.

Oh.

It was strictly

a work thing for years,

especially after his wife died,

then I started helping out

with his son Smith,

and, well, love can

really take you by surprise.

Yes, it can.

(LAUGHS)

- That's him?

- Mm-hmm.

- Aw.

- He's the sweetest kid.

Ohh.

Can't wait for them to see you

in this dress tonight.

Oh, sh**t.

We forgot to buy you underwear.

But my clothes

are at the laundry.

If I leave now,

I can run back to the mall...

Oh, no, no, no.

No. It's fine.

- Are you sure?

- Yeah.

Okay, I guess

we're goin' commando, then.

(BOTH LAUGH)

I can't believe I've been

at Vance for only a day.

Well, Hardin said we'd

be lucky to have you.

- You spoke to Hardin.

- No, Vance did.

He didn't tell you?

Must have slipped his mind.

(PHONE BUZZING)

Yes, well, as long as we're

at the conference by two...

Wow.

You clean up nicely.

Gee, Trevor, you sure know

how to charm the ladies.

Tessa, you look stunning.

Thank you.

On the move.

(DANCE MUSIC)

So what books have you written?

Oh, this and that.

Feel like I'm sitting

at the kids' table.

Thanks.

No, that's not what I meant.

Sorry.

I hate nightclubs.

Probably because

I suck at dancing.

I love Ohio football,

but I hate nightclubs.

Why are we here?

Him.

Mr. Jiang.

His family owns

a hedge fund worth 800 million

and it's considering

investing in Vance's expansion.

You want me to get you a drink?

I'm gonna stick with water.

All my budget

really allows these days.

I thought you were

a paid intern.

You'd be surprised how much

Uber charges can add up.

I mean, I'd be lucky

to break even.

(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

- I'll go.

- What it is?

(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

Sex on the Beach.

Quite a beach.

(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

Grab a straw.

On your mark, get set, go.

It's really good.

Mr. Jiang, have you had a chance

to look at my numbers yet?

With the forecast of

rising interest rates...

(YELLING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

Again. Just...

Yeah.

We're gonna

get f*cked up tonight!

(RAP SONG)

I arrive for the women

I survive through the crimes

As the devil

try and get 'em...

(SONG CONTINUES)

(PARTY CHATTER)

Well, well, look what

the cat dragged in.

That's a stupid

f*cking expression.

Why would a cat

drag me anywhere?

Welcome back, bro.

Did you miss us?

(DANCE MUSIC)

(TESSA, JIANG LAUGHING)

Wait.

I don't get it.

Of course you don't.

This is great!

Tessa: I feel like dancing!

- (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

- (TREVOR REPEATS)

Guess who.

Okay, I'll give you a hint.

She's super f*ckin' hot,

a lot of fun,

and loves to f*ck.

- Mother Teresa.

- No. Ew.

Ta-da!

I know, I look amazing.

I've had, like, no carbs in eight weeks,

- but I'm feeling f*cking fantastic.

- Wow.

Yeah, its from the lack of

carbs and not all the blow.

Don't you have some carpets

to munch on?

Don't you have

some d*ck to suck?

(DANCE MUSIC)

(DANCE MUSIC)

(DANCE MUSIC)

What do I have to do

to make you forgive me?

- I know I've been really bad.

- Worse than bad.

Yeah, but you like it

when I'm bad. (CHUCKLES)

You know you miss me.

Now get the f*ck off me.

ALL: Whoa!

What the f*ck, Hardin?!

Hardin, you didn't mind f*cking me

before, though, right?

Oh, let me guess.

You're still moping

over that stuck-up b*tch.

Don't f*ckin' talk about her,

okay?!

Look at you. You look

like a lost little puppy

over some

Virgin Mary-turned-skank

- who doesn't even want you!

- (DOOR SLAMS)

Ohhh, God.

What the f*ck you looking at,

freshman?

You want me to steal your boyfriend?

So turn the f*ck around.

I look hot.

(CELL PHONE BUZZING)

Tessa?

Hi! I just, uh,

I just wanted to inform you

that I look hot,

and you're missing it.

Tessa, where are you?

Whoo! Somewhere that you're not.

Tess, I have your location,

I can find you.

- (DANCE MUSIC)

- How much have you had to drink?

I don't know, like five?

Five what?

Uh, Sex on the Beaches.

Or is it Sexes on the Beaches?

(SING-SONGY)

That coulda been fun!

You are wasted.

Oh, hey, Hardin?

I'm the commander.

I've been the commander

all night.

Command...

What's it called?

I'm not wearing any underwear!

- Aaah! Ha ha ha!

- Tess, who are you with?

Why haven't you called me?

I've texted you a hundred times!

You haven't replied!

I actually have to go,

but it was nice talking to

you, Mr. Hardin Scott,

so goodbye.

- Don't fu... Te...

- (DISCONNECTS)

Tessa.

Trevor!

I'm drunk, uncomfortable,

and I saw a tampon on the ground.

- I'm leaving.

- Yeah, no, me too.

Can we order room service?

I... I want French fries

and... ice cream.

Dow!

(CHUCKLES)

Nothin' like a vanilla sundae

at three in the morning.

(SLURRING) Yeah,

it sounded better in the moment.

(ROCK BALLAD PLAYING)

- So... Tessa.

- Hmm.

- Tessa Young.

- Mm-hmm.

Why the hell

are you in publishing?

Well, I love to read...

That makes sense.

What's your favorite book?

(SIGHS) It's The Principles of

Economics by Alfred Marshall.

- No, it's not.

- (LAUGHS) Yeah, it is.

No, I mean...

I mean, like, fiction.

Like... Like a real book.

I don't do fiction.

I mean, have you seen

how I dress?

- You heathen!

- Heathen?

You heathen!

Fiction's an escape

from reality,

it's a way that, like,

you can live a hundred lives,

or even a thousand.

I don't need to live

a thousand lives.

Okay? And I would rather

watch paint dry.

(GASPS) I, um, that wasn't...

No, I... that wasn't

supposed to happen.

Look, I'm telling you,

I know what I'm doing.

We just have to soak it

before it stains.

Can I have your pants?

- Tessa...

- Gimme your pants!

Otherwise it's gonna stain.

- (BANGING ON DOOR)

- HARDIN: Tessa!

- Tessa, open the door.

- Is that Hardin Scott?

- (BANGING)

- Open the door!

Hi.

Are you trying to get me

kicked out of this place?

TESSA: Yeah,

come on in, why don't you?

Hey...

Hey, Hardin, didn't see ya.

How ya been?

- f*cking Trevor?!

- Time to go, I think.

- I'm just gonna...

- HARDIN: No, you're not.

- I just wanna talk to him!

- No! No...

- Tessa... Tessa...

- Stop!

- Hardin, I think this is a mis...

- f*ck off.

You're such a d*ck.

Why are you even here?

I'm a d*ck?

I'm not the one taking

advantage of drunk girls.

You... You do know

that not every guy

is trying to get

in my pants, right?

- You'd be surprised.

- You can't tell me

who I can and can't have sex with,

because it's none of your business anymore!

- Were you going to have sex with him?

- Oh, my God!

- What?

- You're insane!

You're avoiding the question.

What if I was?

What?

You heard me.

What if I was?

What, you don't like that?

You don't like the idea

of Trevor's hands...

all over my body?

Touching me?

- (HARDIN GASPS)

- (TESSA LAUGHS)

I've missed this.

- Tessa, you're drunk.

- Mm-hmm. So?

Tess...

Hmm!

You don't want this?

Of course I want this, but I...

Hardin... you have

two options here.

Either you f*ck me,

or you leave.

You decide.

("FORBIDDEN LOVE"

BY MAXCHALANT PLAYING)

(PANTING)

(LAUGHS)

Ohh.

- Do you have a condom?

- Are you sure?

- Why not.

- You'll hate me tomorrow.

Yeah, well, I hate you already.

(TESSA MOANS)

Tell me I'm the only one.

You're the only one.

(BOTH PANTING)

- Hi!

- KIMBERLY: Morning!

- Kimberly!

- You up?

Yeah... no, yeah,

I've been up for a while.

- See you down in five.

- Five minutes?

- Problem?

- Nope, not a problem.

- Meet you in the lobby.

- Okay, I'll be right down.

- Don't be late.

- Okay. Bye.

sh*t!

Where are my clothes?!

Ohh!

Hardin: Tessa!

Come back to bed.

Tessa!

What?!

What do you want?!

The other Tessa.

The one who's nice?

Yeah, well, she's late for work.

- Where are my...

- Why are you so...

Hey! Privacy!

Privacy.

After what we did last night,

you want privacy?

Don't remind me.

Hey, you called me.

I didn't tell you to come here.

Okay, I'm starting

to get the feeling

you're not entirely cool

with what happened last night.

No, I'm not cool with it.

Well, do you want

to talk about it?

Nope. You hurt me

and I can't forgive you.

- That's it.

- So last night meant nothing.

I was drunk.

I called you, you came here...

I made a mistake.

But you obviously missed me.

I didn't know what I was doing.

- From kissing that guy, to...

- What?

- What?

- From kissing?

- What did you say?

- I didn't say anything.

- You said "kissing that guy."

- No.

- What?! T...

- I need to go.

Tessa, wait. Tessa!

- (DOOR OPEN, SHUTS)

- Tessa!

Put your clothes on!

- Who did you kiss?

- No one!

- Was it Trevor?

- No!

My Tessa would never

kiss a f*ckin' stranger

at a club.

There is no "your Tessa"

anymore!

Yeah, well, when you were kissing that

guy, I was f*cking Molly.

f*ck you!

f*ck!

(CHATTER)

- Oh!

- Sorry.

Hi.

- Hi.

- Got us some lattes.

Thank you.

(CHRISTMAS MUZAK PLAYS)

Oh. Thank you.

So, interesting night.

Trevor, I'm... so sorry

about last night.

No, don't be. If I showed up

to my girlfriend's hotel room

and I saw a half-naked,

incredibly handsome man there,

I'd react the same way.

Is he still lurking around?

Should I be hiding in the van?

He's the one that

should be hiding,

and we are not together.

How do you two know each other?

- Hardin worked at Vance last year.

- He did?

Yeah. Same position as you,

actually.

Kind of a sad story.

We were best of friends, and...

then we became lovers,

and then I found

a red hair on my pillow.

Hilarious.

Ya know, I didn't peg you

as the bad boy type.

We'll save that

for another time.

My hero. Ohh.

Anyone else feel like death?

I don't know what you two said

or did to Neil last night,

but he just wrote a humongous

check to finance our expansion.

Good job.

Landon: What are you doing here?

Hardin: I need some advice.

Advice?

You want advice from me?

Yeah.

I'm that desperate.

Oh, insults. Great.

I thought you were

an imposter for a second.

- Look, bro, I know I-

- No, step-bro.

I'm not your brother.

You made that very clear.

And if I was Tessa,

I'd never speak to you again, Hardin.

- It's unforgiveable.

- You think I don't know that?!

I know I f*cked up!

I know!

She won't return my calls

or texts.

I found out she kissed some guy.

And... And I told her

I f*cked Molly.

- You slept with Molly?

- No, I said I did.

That's the point.

I didn't.

I said it to get back at her,

and I-I realized

how stupid that was.

- Yeah.

- Oh, f*ck this!

So you're just gonna run away like

you do from everything. Right?

- Where you goin'?

- London.

I was going to take her with me.

I'll see you next year.

Hardin, do you really love her?

No bullshit.

Yes.

Of course I f*cking love her.

I've never felt this way

about anyone before!

Just wish I didn't

f*ck the whole thing up.

(STARTS CAR)

(TIRES SQUEAL)

(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

Focus.

Knock knock.

- Hi.

- Hi.

You're probably goin'

out of town for break,

so just wanna say happy

holidays, and a happy birthday.

- It's your birthday, right?

- Tomorrow.

I made you something.

What's... What's this?

(CLEARS THROAT) It is a

cost analysis breakdown

of your weekly Uber expenditure

versus owning a used car.

Okay...

I know. It's just,

turns out you're wasting a lot of money.

I did a little research,

and I found a 2013 Toyota Corolla,

in town, in excellent condition.

I went down to the dealership,

negotiated terms,

and you'd put no money down,

you only pay 150 bucks a month.

Vance also agreed to put your

auto insurance on company policy,

so that's free.

This is, of course,

if you want to do it.

I just like crunching numbers...

(LAUGHING)

Oh, my God!

- I take it you...

- Oh, my God! Mwah!

Thank you.

Bye, Tessa.

(THUD)

Tessa: So, what do you think?

Well, you know,

it's, uh...

it's very Tessa.

I will take that

as a compliment.

I'm right up there.

How's Dakota?

Um, I'm actually looking

at your birthday horoscope.

So first off,

you share a birthday with...

- Joseph Stalin.

- Great.

- You are a proud, idealistic person...

- Like Stalin.

You are more emotional

than is obvious.

You may solidify

a romantic relationship

or become involved

with a mature partner.

Mature.

That doesn't really sound...

No, it doesn't.

He left for London.

Have you heard from him?

I haven't,

because I blocked him.

That'll work.

Bye.

(CAR LOCK CHIRPS)

(TESSA, ECHOING)

Whose place is this?

(SIGHS)

(CHUCKLES)

Hardin:

"You can draw me to fire,

"you can draw me to water.

"You can draw me to the gallows,

you can draw me to any death."

(CRYING SOFTLY)

(SIGHS)

HARDIN: Well, here we are.

I could run you a bath

if you'd like to get

more comfortable.

Woman: I would love that.

I remember when you and I

used to take baths together.

Oh, my goodness! Tessa?

- Tessa.

- Hardin's mother.

Hardin said you were

gonna be out of town,

I didn't think

I was gonna meet you!

- Yeah.

- My God,

I cannot believe

how pretty you are.

I mean, Hardin said you were the

most beautiful girl in the world,

but honestly, I thought you were

gonna be covered in tattoos,

green hair,

and a piercing on your bean.

- What bean?

- Mum.

Don't be so melodramatic,

Hardin.

You and I are gonna

be the best of friends.

Do you mind if I use the loo?

Yeah, of course.

It's just, um...

Oh, look at you!

- Why are you here?

- (WHISPERS) I came to get the rest of my stuff.

- You were supposed to be in London.

- I know.

I didn't want to go without

you, so she came here.

Why didn't you tell her

that we broke up?

She was so excited

when I told her first,

- I couldn't ruin it for her.

- Hardin!

She's my mum!

I couldn't tell her

about the stupid bet, okay?

I'm sorry.

I don't expect you

to pretend we're still together.

- It's fine.

- What's fine?

I said it's fine.

I'll play along.

Thank you, Tessa.

Thank you so much.

Thanks for the Kindle.

f*ck! Happy birthday!

- Is it your birthday?

- Yeah, it is.

Why are we not celebrating?

'Cause I... I was just about

to head out of town.

- No!

- Yeah, I'm gonna see my mom.

Can I be selfish and ask

you to stay another night?

Well, my mom's sort of expec...

We don't know when we're

gonna see each other again.

Yeah. I, uh, I...

I guess I can leave tomorrow.

Brilliant, brilliant,

brilliant.

I am gonna whip you up a homemade birthday

cake that is gonna blow your mind.

Cool.

Cool.

I know I'm biased

'cause I'm his mum,

but isn't that just the cutest

little bum you've ever seen?

- (LAUGHING)

- Oh, my God, Mum, please.

- Hush.

- It's a pretty cute bum,

- Hardin.

- (HARDIN CLEARS THROAT)

Right. Well, uh,

you guys are obviously

having lots of fun,

so I'm just gonna clear up,

and then... set myself on fire.

So Hardin tells me you're

an English major as well.

Mm-hmm. I'm in the process

of switching from econ.

I actually just got an

internship at Vance Publishing.

Vance, as in... Christian Vance?

Mm-hmm.

Hardin and I stayed with

Vance for a few years

when Ken and I broke up.

- Really?

- Yeah.

Hardin never mentioned that.

Hardin: Never mentioned what?

Nothing, darling.

Just girl talk.

(CRICKETS CHIRPING)

I'm just gonna grab a blanket

and sleep on the floor.

You don't think we could

share the bed and not...

- You know.

- Do you?

Well, I'd like to think

that we're not

total Neanderthals.

Okay.

G'night.

(SIGHS)

Good night.

Um...

I'm gonna leave

early in the morning

to... to head out of town.

Okay.

Thank you for staying tonight.

Thanks for having me.

Sorry.

No. No, it's...

That's okay.

That feels nice.

- Does it?

- Mm-hmm.

- Did you have a nice birthday?

- Yeah, I did.

And thank you again

for the... gift,

it was really thoughtful.

I found it when I was

getting my stuff.

I'm glad you like it.

(BREATHLESSLY)

I love it.

(GIGGLES)

(TAKES DEEP BREATH)

I got a car.

- You got a car?

- Mm-hmm.

What car did you get?

(INHALES SHARPLY)

A white one.

Well, happy birthday.

Good night.

- Good night.

- Good night.

Good night.

- Hardin.

- Huh?

This isn't working.

Why? What's wrong?

Feel.

- (SIGHS)

- Oh.

You?

Oh.

(PANTING)

Hardin, we should stop.

Okay.

Three seconds and we'll stop.

- Mm.

- Mm-hmm.

- Three...

- Three...

- two...

- two...

- one.

- One.

(PANTING)

- Okay, ten more seconds.

- Okay.

- And then we'll stop.

- Okay.

- Yeah?

- Yeah.

Will you apologize to your mum

for us kidnapping you last night?

I will.

I can't tell you how much it means

to me to see Hardin this way.

What way?

Happy.

What?

(CHUCKLES)

- Bye.

- Bye.

- (LAUGHS) Noah, hi!

- Hi!

- It's good to see you!

Good to see you too.

Mmm. (SNIFFS)

Okay... (LAUGHS)

Your mom told me that you were comin' home

today, so I figured I'd come greet you.

Did she have you on speed dial

the second I crossed

the county line?

I mean,

can you blame her?

She knows a good thing

when she sees it.

- (LAUGHS) Right.

- Right.

Um, how's senior year?

You know me,

breakin' hearts and takin' names.

- That's you.

- Yeah? Yeah.

Your mom told me

about the internship.

- That's really awesome.

- Thanks. Yeah.

And everything's cool with

the whole thing with your dad.

- What whole thing with my dad?

- What?

N-Nothing. Nothing.

- What do you mean, nothing?

- I-I don't know.

- I thought that she would have...

- Thought she what?

- Uh...

- (CELL PHONE RINGS)

- Are you kidding?

- (RINGING)

- Why is she calling you?

- I'm sorry, Tess.

WOMAN: Sorry,

I got stuck at work.

- Is she there yet?

- Mom?

- Carol, she knows!

- Knows what?!

Oh! Tessa's with you.

I hope I'm not interrupting

anything.

What is going on with Dad?!

Okay, that was rude.

I'm just asking you about Dad.

Fine.

Your father wanted to see you,

but I chased him off.

Why are you getting

so worked up about this?

I'm not getting worked up!

I just don't understand why

you'd keep that a secret.

And you never kept

any secrets from me?

Because I can think of

a big one, and so can Noah.

I thought we got past

this little hiccup

once you got your heart broken.

But I can tell by

the sound of your voice

that this not the case.

This boy is not good for you,

Teresa.

- He is just like your father.

- I'm hanging up.

- No! Don't you f*cking hang up on me!

- This was a mistake.

Theresa? Theresa?

- (CAR DOOR CLOSES)

- I blew it.

I blew it, Carol.

I don't know what happened.

(CAR DOOR CLOSES)

(RAIN PATTERING,

THUNDER RUMBLING)

- (GLASS BREAKING)

- (WOMAN SHOUTING)

Mummy?

- (MAN, WOMAN ARGUING)

- (OBJECTS CLATTERING)

(WOMAN SHOUTING ANGRILY)

- (MAN SHOUTS)

- (BLOW LANDING)

(MUFFLED) No!

Mummy?

Hardin, get back upstairs now!

(GASPING)

Hey. Hey, I'm right here.

Hey. Hey.

Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

(THUNDER CRASHING)

It was just a nightmare.

(BREATHING SLOWS)

(DOOR OPENS)

Morning.

There... um, there's tea.

I... Help yourself.

Thanks.

Is he okay?

- Hmm?

- The nightmares.

I heard him last night.

Um, he's sleeping now.

How long have they

been going on?

Uh, ever since he was eight.

Um, he, uh, well...

He told me...

about that night

and what he saw.

The as*ault.

Whoa. He's never

told anyone that before.

I'm so sorry for

what happened to you.

I just hoped he'd forget

the whole thing.

But the nightmares kicked in.

(CHOKES UP)

Sorry.

And I took him to therapist

after therapist,

but nothing seemed to help.

And then he started

self-medicating with alcohol.

But, um...

...he told me that

the nightmares went away

when he started seeing you.

(LAUGHS SOFTLY)

I didn't know that.

May I ask...

why does your mum

hate him so much?

Um, Hardin's your son...

Yes, and I love him,

but he is not without

his challenges.

You can tell me.

What happened between you two?

He lied to me.

- A big lie?

- A massive lie.

Is he sorry?

He is.

HARDIN: What are you

two gabbing on about?

Make sure you brush your teeth.

He used to give me such a hard

time about brushing his teeth.

Mum, for the love of God,

of course I'm gonna

brush my teeth.

Great. Morning!

- Morning. Thank you.

- Kisses:

I love your mom.

She's all right.

Happy belated.

But you already got me a gift.

True, but you

had to snoop around

and open it without me,

thus denying me

the pleasure of watching

you react to said gift.

Therefore...

"Tessa's perfect day."

What's my perfect day?

Well, that's for you to decide.

Whatever your wish or desire,

I will agree to without

any snide remarks or tantrums.

Your time starts in three,

two, one.

Kisses:

Tessa: Isn't this nice?

I always wanted

to go ice skating.

Yeah, it's... great.

I'm loving...

Unhh! Unh...

- Are you okay?

- Yeah.

Just a tad rusty.

When was the last time

you skated?

I've never skated before.

Do you want me

to get you a walker?

(WOMAN, TO CHILD)

You're doing great.

f*ck no!

- (GRUNTS)

- Are you... Oh, it's okay. It's... it's okay.

Whoo.

- Are you okay?

- Yup.

Do you want to stop?

No. We're here to have...

- Unhh! Aaah!

- (TESSA GASPS)

Hardin?

I have a better idea.

Stretch out into Child's Pose,

and let the day's

tension just melt away.

It's not the pose

melting this tension away,

- it's the f*cking heat.

- Shh!

- Is there any air-conditioning?

- It's hot yoga.

INSTRUCTOR: From Child's Pose,

lift, and slowly press back

into your Downward Facing Dog.

Did anyone ever tell you

you have the most amazing bum?

Stop.

...and slowly move into

salamba sarvangasana.

Excuse me,

is this beginner's yoga?

That was at ten-thirty.

This is acro-yoga.

INSTRUCTOR: ...and then lift

them up and towards the ceiling.

Breathe together.

Inhale, lift your arms overhead.

And as you exhale,

lean forward.

- Allow your partner's weight to lean into you.

- (TESSA LAUGHING)

Slowly breathe and

open your legs and...

wider... inhale...

a little wider...

and if you can,

put your legs even wider.

(EXHALES)

Is yoga supposed

to be a turn-on?

Are you turned on?

Mm-hmm.

- Can we leave then?

- Mm-hmm.

- Now? Let's go.

- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

Sweaty! I am sweaty!

Wait! Just give me

five minutes, okay?

I just need to get... (SHRIEKS)

(TESSA LAUGHING, SHRIEKING)

Oh, my God. Hardin.

- Pop the champagne, I'm feelin' elevated

- Let's get these off.

Oh, there's something

happening in my brain

Okay, we're getting somewhere!

I guess

it's one of those days

I'm wakin' up to someone,

feeling f*cking awesome

I'm not sad

when I'm watching him leave

Low to high

Oh, my, my

I'm feeling

so f*ckin' good right now

Good right now

I just wanna

get drunk right now

I feel so damn alive,

I don't wanna come down

I'm feeling

so f*cking good right now

- Good right now

- Oh, sh*t!

I can't contain it

Maybe it was the breakup,

maybe I just woke up

On the right side

of my empty bed

Maybe it's nothing,

increase the dopamine

That keeps on stoking me

But I like what

it's done to my head

Low to high

Oh, my, my

I'm feeling

so f*ckin' good right now

(TESSA MOANS)

I just wanna

get drunk right now

Drunk right now

I feel so damn alive

I don't wanna come down

I'm feeling

so f*ckin' good right now

Good right now

And I can't explain it...

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

It's my boss,

I have to get this.

Are you serious?

Hi! Kimberly,

what's wrong?

Oh, no. How can we help?

Hmm.

TESSA: Hi.

You have no idea

how much of a lifesaver

the two of you are right now.

God, poor Vance caught this bug

and he's throwing up everywhere.

It's no problem.

Okay, who are you and what

have you done with Hardin?

It's part of my birthday present.

I'll tell you later.

Ohh! I'm running so late.

I'll be back in a few hours,

okay? You're in good hands.

- Bye.

- KIMBERLY: Thank you.

Hi.

Um, so, we have the

whole afternoon together.

- Is there anything that you want to do?

- No.

I could get us some markers

and we can draw!

I don't like to draw.

No? Are you hungry?

No.

(CLICKS TONGUE)

(MODEL TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS)

Wanna tell me about your trains?

Okay, I don't want

to hear about them anyway.

What are those marks

on your arm?

My tattoos.

- Why do you have them?

- Because I like them.

Don't people think

it looks strange?

I don't give a f*ck

what people think.

Which people don't you

give a f*ck about?

- Oh, sh*t. Don't say f*ck.

- sh*t.

f*ck. sh*t.

Fucky f*ck. sh*t...

- Hey. So...

- Hi!

He is actually hungry now.

We need to get him some...

- (BOTH TALKING)

- f*ck. sh*t. (SMITH CONTINUES REPEATING)

Uh, I can go if you want.

- Or you could.

- No, it's fine.

- I'll get us some sandwiches.

- Perfect.

- Thank you so much.

- Whoo! Okay!

- See you later. Bye-bye.

- Okay, bye!

Smith: sh*t. f*ck. sh*t.

Go ahead.

Here,

I can take those now.

You know, she really

brings out the best in you.

(SOFTLY LAUGHS)

Is it that obvious?

Have a nice holiday.

You too.

See ya, mate.

See ya, mate.

You ready?

Yeah. Uh, we're

the last ones here,

so I just have to set the alarm.

Merry Christmas.

Christmas is next week.

I've never been one

to follow the rules.

It says "Whatever our souls

are made of..."

"His and mine are the same."

What's wrong?

I didn't think that I'd see you over the

holidays, so I didn't get you anything.

Is there anything that you want?

Another chance?

(LAUGHS)

Do you promise to act

like this every day?

No.

But I'll try.

Whatever it takes.

We can't do this here.

What if someone comes in?

(SHOUTS) Helloooo?

Anyone here?

Anyone?!

You just have an answer

for everything, don't you?

It's fake.

sh*t.

(GASPS)

(PANTING)

There's no one else

for me, Tessa.

No one.

I love you.

(BREATHLESS)

I love you too.

Don't say "too." Sounds like

you're agreeing with me.

I love you, Hardin.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

Man: Trish.

Yeah, it's Ken.

This is a surprise.

So listen, um,

my wife Karen and I

are having people over

for Christmas, and...

we would love it if you and

Hardin and Tessa could join us.

Well, I'm leaving for London

today, but, um...

the flight's not

until this evening,

so I think we can pop over.

It would mean the world to me.

I guess we'll see you later,

then.

Merry Christmas, Trish.

- Yeah?

- Yeah.

- Yeah?

- Yeah.

Oh! I'm so proud of you.

Can't wait to meet her.

This is his house?

- I told you.

- For f*ck's sake,

I didn't think it was this big.

Mum, we don't have to do this.

Look, the last time I saw

your dad was ten years ago.

It's time. Come on.

(SIGHS)

- Hi. Karen?

- Yes, hi.

Thank you for having us.

O Christmas tree

O Christmas tree

How lovely are your branches

O Christmas tree,

O Christmas tree

How lovely are your branches

In beauty green

will always grow

Through summer sun

and winter snow

O Christmas tree,

O Christmas tree

Well, come on.

Merry Christmas.

How lovely are

are your branches

O Christmas tree,

O Christmas tree

You are the tree most loved

O Christmas tree...

This humble one,

right here now,

he just co-authored

a new interpretation

of Taming of the Shrew

with the head of

the English department.

Landon: It's not a big deal.

- KEN: It is a big deal!

- (CONVERSATION CONTINUES, INDISTINCT)

In brightly shining

Christmas light

O Christmas tree,

O Christmas tree

Ken:

...directed that to perfection.

That third act had me in tears.

We saw it twice.

(CONVERSATION CONTINUES)

O Christmas tree,

O Christmas tree

- (LAUGHTER)

- Your beauty green will teach me

O Christmas tree,

O Christmas tree

Your beauty green

will teach me

O Christmas tree,

O Christmas tree

Your beauty green will...

Trish: Uber's gonna be here

- in five minutes.

- Oh!

Well, I'm glad you stopped by.

Me too.

Dinner should be ready shortly.

Okay, I hope everybody

has a hearty appetite.

- MAN: Absolutely!

- Karen is a dynamite cook.

Landon: Yes, she is.

Where'd you go?

Just for a walk.

So Trish,

I hear that

this is your first time

in the States?

- Yeah, it is.

- And how do you like it?

There's a lot to see.

It's kind of worn out

its welcome, if you ask me.

Be happy to get back home

once I graduate.

You're moving back to England

after graduation?

Yeah, of course I am.

KAREN: Trish, can I get you

another glass before you leave us?

TRISH: No. But it was lovely.

Thank you.

I'm so glad you like it.

We got it in Greece

on our honeymoon.

Ken: I stuck to Pellegrino.

We stayed in

this gorgeous villa.

Did you know that

the beaches in Santorini

are made up of volcanic pebbles,

so there's no sand

to make the water murky.

So it is a crystal-clear...

- What the f*ck is wrong with you?

- TRISH: Hardin.

- Excuse me?

- Look at your f*cking trousers.

I'm sorry, Mum,

but seriously,

do you have any sensitivity

whatsoever?

You're just boorishly droning on

with no regard for

the lives you destroyed.

P-Perhaps we could find

a more private place

- to have this conversation.

- By all means.

It's Bill Gates.

(LAUGHS)

Okay, well, you are obviously

quite upset with me,

so go ahead and say

what's on your mind.

Why did you even invite us here?

I invited you here

because you're my family.

We're not your family.

We were your family.

- You ran out and reinvented...

- Hardin, I thought we were past this.

We didn't get past it. How were

we supposed to get past it?

You haven't owned up

to anything!

Your twelve steps...

making amends.

Where's Mum's amends?

Mum, have you got your amends yet?

What would you like me to do?

You don't think that

I am consumed by guilt?

I knew that night

that I had to go.

No! After that night

you had to stay!

And you didn't!

That night happened because of you!

Yes! And I have been haunted

by it for the last ten years!

It haunts you?!

I f*cking watched it happen,

- you bastard!

- (ALL EXCLAIM)

(GRUNTS)

I'm sorry, Mum.

I had to.

No, wait. You don't have to get an Uber.

I can give you a ride.

After the sh*t

you've just pulled?

Not to mention you're drunk.

Look, I'm sorry

I'm not like you.

You may be able to forget

everything he did, but I can't.

I haven't forgotten anything.

I've chosen to forgive him

so that I can move on.

Hardin, resentments like this

are gonna destroy you.

And they're gonna take Tessa

right down with you.

I should've known better

To see what I could see

My black shroud

- Holding down my feelings

- I'm going for a walk.

A pillar for my enemies

I should have known better

- f*ck!

- To see what I could see

My black shroud

I never trust my feelings

I waited for the remedy

When I was three

Three, maybe four

She left us

at that video store

Oh, be my rest,

be my fantasy

- Hardin.

- Oh, be my rest

Be my fantasy

Hardin.

Hardin!

(SONG BLASTING IN EAR BUDS)

I'm light as a feather

I'm bright as

the Oregon breeze

My black shroud

Frightened by my feelings

I only want to be a relief

Hold that, please!

Oh.

And I thought I was the only Grinch

who worked the day after Christmas.

We have gotta stop

meeting like this.

You're right. I'll have restraining

orders drafted immediately.

How was your Christmas?

Uneventful. Yours?

Eventful.

That's a loaded response.

(DOORS OPEN)

Well, I'd love to hear more

about your eventful Christmas,

so... lunch?

Postmates. I'm buying.

How could I refuse?

Great. I'll email you

some menus.

I know,

very chivalrous of me.

I thought that things were

getting better, but...

it's clear that he still has a

lot of stuff he has to deal with.

And I just feel

really bad for him...

and I don't know how to fix it.

Well, let me ask you this.

Are you in love with him?

- I am.

- Then you got yourself a problem.

Those are your words of wisdom?

Hey, I never said I had

any words of wisdom.

No, you just wanted to know

whether I actually loved him.

I should get back to work.

Thank you for lunch.

Next time it's on me.

I don't think there's

gonna be a next time.

Ouch.

No, not like that,

believe me.

I'm moving to Seattle.

Vance offered me the Head of

Finance position at the new office.

Oh, my God.

Trevor, that's amazing.

Thanks.

Well, ya know,

I don't leave tomorrow.

We could still... that's...

No, that's stupid.

(LAUGHS)

Tessa.

My sister has struggled

with addiction her whole life.

This thing between

you and Hardin...

it's not gonna end well.

Well, you're wrong.

(NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

(NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

This one's better anyway.

You're never gonna show me what

you're writing in there, are you?

Maybe... someday.

(CELL PHONE BUZZING)

(BUZZING)

You don't wanna see who that is?

I know who it is.

It's Steph.

The frat house is having

a New Year's Eve party.

Right.

Do you wanna go?

No. I don't wanna

leave you here alone.

I wouldn't be alone.

I'd go with you.

Sorry, I... I just thought

after everything that happened

- that you wouldn't want to...

- I'm not scared of them.

Besides, if it

blows up in my face,

then we can just

stay in next year.

- Kisses:

- (TESSA GIGGLES)

What was that for?

I just loved

how you said "next year."

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

Hello?

Tessa, why aren't you

in the office?

Well, yeah, I...

I thought it was...

I'm kidding.

Happy New Year.

(LAUGHS) Yes!

You got me.

I'll cut to the chase.

We went with the manuscript

you recommended,

and it sold today

in quite a bidding w*r.

Wow, that's... that's fantastic.

Listen, we were

gonna hire someone

to do digital submissions

in Seattle, but...

you're better than anyone

I've interviewed.

I'll take care of your tuition,

living expenses, provided you transfer.

Obviously, Hardin's welcome

to join you.

Wow, that...

uh, that sounds really amazing.

Um, can you give me a chance

to think about it, please?

Of course. I just wanted

to share the good news.

Happy New Year, Tess.

Happy New Year, sir.

Hey.

Were you talking to me?

Nope.

What is taking so long?

Being a woman.

Now, can you go wait outside?

- So sorry.

- Thanks.

- (PARTY CHATTER)

- (POP MUSIC PLAYING)

(MUSIC BLARING)

Undefeated!

f*ck!

- It's okay.

- Sorry. Sorry.

Steph: We've missed you.

Are we good?

Tessa: Ancient history.

TRISTAN: You guys

wanna get in on this?

Yeah, you can take my place.

Go. I'll watch.

I like to watch.

Yeah, I bet you do.

Okay, sure.

You know what you're doing,

right?

- Not a clue.

- Awesome.

Great.

Steph, Tristan: Tessa!

Mmm.

Mm.

What is that?

Both: Cherry vodka sour.

Cool.

This is fun!

- Yes!

- Yes!

Steph and Tristan: Drink, b*tch!

Whoo! I like this!

- GIRL: Nice job! One more!

- Aowww!

(CHATTER)

(SHRIEKS)

(MUSIC, CHATTER)

Girl: I... suck at this.

Jamie. Hey.

- It is you.

- Hi.

Can I talk to you upstairs?

Lead the way.

(MUSIC, CHATTER)

Molly's here!

You f*cking kidding me?

Molly: f*ck this.

So cool,

all those gears.

You're like a robot.

Who says I'm not?

I have a tattoo

of a little butterfly,

but you can only see it

when I'm naked.

- I love butterflies.

- Really?

Yeah.

(RAP MUSIC)

(TESSA, SLURRING) Hey!

I was looking for you.

Hey. Let's leave.

Okay.

Aww. If it isn't the cute

couple together again.

Oh, yay. It's Molly.

- Where you guys going?

- We're going home.

Ohh. Lame. Come on,

it's almost New Year's.

- We just wanna be alone.

- Let's go.

Good. She never really

fit in, anyway.

One drink.

Hardin: What... Tess.

Excuse me, lovebirds,

you're on my chair.

- Seriously?

- Yeah. Now, f*ck off.

Move.

b*tch.

Guy: Yes, I am druuuunk!

Would anybody like some weed brownies?

I made 'em myself.

- No.

- Oh, I'm good.

Well, this is fun.

Can we leave?

We should play a game.

Like what, Scrabble?

How about...

- Truth or Dare?

- Jesus Christ.

- Why is that bad?

- Long story.

- Why would you say that?

- Because.

What's the matter, Hardin?

Scared of a little Truth or Dare?

f*ck you, Molly.

I'll go first.

Hey, Tess, truth or dare?

Truth.

Uh, are you a virgin?

Molly, don't.

Oh. Duh. I already know

the answer to that,

because Hardin f*cked you.

Yes, he did.

My turn. Molly,

truth or dare?

Hmm, truth.

Is it true that you're a whore?

Both: Oh, sh*t.

What the f*ck did

you just call me?

I didn't call you anything.

I just asked you a question.

Are you a whore?

- You are.

- You have to answer honestly,

because it's called

Truth for a reason.

No.

Do they not like each other?

Hey, Tess,

my turn again.

- Truth or dare?

- Truth.

Is it true that

you're a dumb-a*s

for getting back together

with Hardin

after he clearly f*cked you

for a bet?

Let's go.

No, that's not true.

Oh... but it is.

You believe anything

that comes out of his mouth.

I f*cking hate you, Molly.

Which I don't blame you,

because, oh, man,

what that mouth can do.

And that tongue...

(MOLLY SHRIEKS)

(BOTH YELLING)

Get away from me!

- You, like that, whore!

- ALL: Ohh!

(SCREAMING)

(TESSA SHRIEKING)

Tessa, relax!

(TESSA YELLING)

You're a whore!

Get that f*ckin' b*tch

out of here!

Happy new year, b*tch!

f*ck you, Tessa!

Get off me!

And you, move the f*ck

out of my way!

(BOTH LAUGHING)

- TESSA: ...UFC or some..

- HARDIN: UFC?

(SIGHS)

I needed that.

I'll bet you did.

- Ahhh.

- You're crazy.

I know.

I don't wanna be

a good girl tonight

- I just wanna be a bad girl all right

- Aaah!

Just wanna be your only one

You should hit me up,

boy, you got my number

Don't wanna be

a good girl tonight

I just wanna be

your bad girl, all right

- Just wanna be your only one

- Pants.

Boy, you got my number,

949-331...

Ms. Young, are you

objectifying me?

Why, yes, I am,

Mr. Scott.

For a good time

- I'll be waitin'...

- Right.

Three minutes till New Year!

All: Whooo!

(BOTH PANTING)

(MOANING)

Is the door locked?

f*ck the door,

I don't know.

- Oh, my God.

- Am I your god?

Yeah!

Thirty seconds!

Whooo!

(ALL CHEERING)

(DISTANT FIREWORKS POPPING)

We're set.

Hey.

I'm gonna use the bathroom.

(HARDIN CLEARS THROAT)

- (CELL PHONE CHIMES)

- Tessa, your phone.

- TESSA: What?

- Your phone.

Hardin?

(ROCK MUSIC)

Hey, you!

- Happy New Year.

- Hey.

I'm really glad we did that.

Me too.

Do me a favor and just

keep it between us?

Of course.

I never kiss and tell.

Thank you.

Uh-oh.

You piece of sh*t!

(LAUGHTER, CHATTER)

Hardin: Tessa, wait!

- Hey. Hey!

- Just hear me out.

- Kisses: - What the f*ck?!

- Dude, she kissed me.

- f*ck off!

Tessa, what the f*ck!

How can you do that?!

Why do you care, huh?

You just kissed that girl.

No, no, no,

you don't get to cry!

You just f*cking kissed a guy

right in front of me!

- And what did you do, huh?

- Nothing!

- The f*ck is wrong with you?!

- She just said

that she doesn't kiss and tell,

you f*cking liar!

It's a figure of speech!

You should know I would

never f*cking cheat on you!

Were you with her tonight? Is she who

you disappeared with the whole night?!

- Yes!

- (SOBS)

- I was trying to make her forgive me.

- For what?!

Because I'm trying to be a better

person for you! That's all I f*cking do!

Tell me what else I can do to

make you believe that I love you.

Tell me!

You're never gonna trust me.

Trust you?

You think that

I should trust you.

Yes!

Where has that ever gotten me?

You're never gonna

forgive me, are you?

You're just gonna keep bringing it

up, every time.

Because I don't trust you!

You act like

you're so f*cking innocent.

Like you're perfect.

Oh, f*ck this.

And f*ck you!

f*ck you too.

f*ck off!

Now I washed up

in some foreign place...

Hardin.

Hardin?

Fire coursin'

through my blood

And I say

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

You can do your worst

Yeah

Whoo-ooh-ooh...

Hey.

Hey.

Do you have a charger?

In my car.

Hardin, can you please

pick up the phone?

I really need to talk to you.

Make a left on Oakwood.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

(RINGING)

(RINGING)

(HORN HONKING)

- (CRASH)

- Hello?

Oh, my God.

- Stop the car.

- I can't.

- Stop your f*cking car!

- Okay!

(TIRES SQUEAL)

Tessa!

(MEDICS CHATTERING)

Hardin: Tessa! Wait! Stop!

Stop! Stop!

Tessa...!

Theresa Young?

Yes, hello?

- WOMAN: Mercy Hospital.

- Hello, yes?

- Can I help you?

- Theresa Young. She's 19.

- I don't see that patient.

- She should be there.

You're the fifth hospital

I've spoken to!

- Don't f*cking put... f*ck!

- LANDON: Hardin!

The f*ck is wrong with you?

How could you do this to Tessa?

- Tessa? Where is she?

- I'm not telling you.

- Landon, where is she?!

- I'm not telling you!

- Tell me where she is!

- It's your fault she crashed!

You didn't come home last night!

Get off of me!

She was out looking for you.

I don't believe you.

(LINE OUT RINGING)

- Click:

- Tessa?

Trevor:

What do you want, Hardin?

Trevor?

- Trevor, what the f*ck are you doing with Tessa's phone?

- I'm with her now.

- Let me talk to her.

- That's not gonna happen.

Trevor, I'm not

f*cking playing with you!

Shut the f*ck up

and listen to me.

You're toxic and

you're bad news.

If you love Tessa, and I

think that you do, let her go.

Trevor, I just

wanna talk to her.

Please. Please.

Trevor, please,

just let me talk to her.

Give her a chance to find

happiness in this life,

'cause she's never

gonna find it with you.

Nurse: Here you go, hon.

Hey, good news.

Vance's company policy

is going to put your hospital

and car fees on it, so...

Here's your phone.

Hardin.

Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

You used to tell me

that you loved me once

What happened,

what happened?

Where is all of this

coming from...

Hardin: "My dearest Tessa,

"like all our favorite stories,

"there are happy

and unhappy endings.

"I thought we had a chance

for a happy one,

"but at last,

it was not mean to be.

"I love you

with all of my heart,

"and that's exactly why I had to get

as far away from you as possible.

"We're like an addiction to each

other, with equal parts pleasure...

- "and pain."

- Because I don't trust you!

"And as for that other night,

that girl,"

"she was one of

my former conquests."

"I had to apologize for my past in

order to have a future with you,"

"but fate just...

seems to get in our way."

"So let's cut the bullshit.

"You're too damn good for me,

and I know it.

"And somewhere

in the back of my mind

"I always knew we wouldn't last,

"and I think you did, too.

"I know this is going

to be painful at first,

"and it could take days,

even more.

"But one of those days,

you're going to wake up

"and the sorrow will

start to slip away...

"until we're nothing

but a distant memory.

Goodbye, Tessa."

Do you remember

when you loved me once?

What happened,

what happened?

And you'd hold me here,

just because

What happened, no

We used to never

go to bed angry

But it's all we ever do...

- You have to call me.

- You're turning away like you hate me

We need to talk about this,

okay?

- Do you hate me?

- You can't disappear for nine days. Call me.

- Call me.

- You-ooh-ooh

Can take this heart

Heal it or break it

all apart

- No, this isn't fair

- (MAN YELLING)

- Love me or leave me here

- HARDIN: Tessa?!

Hardin, help me!

(SCREAMS)

(CONTINUES SCREAMING)

Ooh-ooh

- TRISH: It's okay.

- You-ooh-ooh

Can take this heart

Heal or break it all apart

No-oh-oh

This isn't fair

Love me or leave me here

Oh-oh-oh, oh-ah-ah

Love me or leave me here

Oh-oh-oh, oh-ah-ah

Love me or leave me here

(SONG FADES OUT)

Hardin: Thank you.

TRISH: How are

the applications going?

Fine. Dad said

he'd make some calls.

You two spoke?

How'd that go?

As well as it could.

Hardin, what happened

that night,

it wasn't his fault.

And all the other nights?

Not his fault?

Yeah, it was sh*t.

It was sh*t, and we both

deserved better.

But the only person

you're punishing

by not forgiving him

is yourself.

And Hardin, I want you

to stop punishing yourself.

So you think it's fair

that he gets to live in

that big, fancy house,

and you're here all alone?

Who said I was alone?

What?

You're seeing someone?

- You don't have to sound so surprised.

- Who?

- Mike.

- Mike?

- w*nk*r-from-next-door Mike?

- He's not a w*nk*r!

- He is a bit of a w*nk*r.

- He's a really nice man,

and he treats me well.

Yeah, he f*cking better.

Did you hear that Vance

was moving to Seattle?

Tessa's going too.

How did you know?

Well, we talk from time to time.

He's having a going-away

party on Sunday,

and I think you should get your

a*s off this sofa and go get her.

- No, I can't.

- Can't? Or you don't want to face what you left behind?

I'd have to leave right now.

So what are you waiting for?

- Mum, I'm not gonna...

- Hardin...

I love you, but you have to start

fighting for what really matters.

- (PARTY CHATTER)

- (GLASS CLINKING)

VANCE: Thank you all

so much for coming.

It means the world to me to have

everyone I love here with us.

I am... beyond proud

of the work that everyone

in this room has done,

but there is one

particular person

I could not have done

any of this without.

And that's Kimberly.

(CHEERS, APPLAUSE)

Smith and I were talking

the other day,

and he said, "Dad,

going-away parties are kind of sad."

And he's got a point.

And we were like,

"How do we make this a celebration?"

Then we got an idea.

(WHISPERS)

- (GUESTS GASPING)

- Kimberly...

will you marry my dad

and be my stepmom?

ALL: Aww...

(SURPRISED LAUGH) Yes!

Yes!

(CHEERS, APPLAUSE)

What about me?

(LAUGHTER)

- MAN: Aww...

- MAN 2: Yay!

(CHEERS CONTINUE)

(CHATTER)

Who said happy endings

don't exist?

TESSA: Don't tell me.

You're the cynic.

I'm turning over a new leaf.

You look very pretty,

by the way.

So... have you made up

your mind about Seattle?

Well, I don't see

much of a reason

to pass up the opportunity

anymore.

That's...

really nice to hear.

(NERVOUS CHUCKLE)

Look, Tessa,

there's something

I actually want

to get off my chest.

Okay.

Uh, the other day,

in the hospital...

I answered your cell phone,

it was Hardin,

and I told him

to stay away from you.

- What?

- In retrospect,

I do realize that

that was over the line,

and I do realize that I let my

emotions get the best of me,

and I'm sorry,

but somehow you bring

that side out of me, so...

Okay.

Are you okay?

Eh.

There's actually

more I'd like to say,

- but would you excuse me for a second?

- Yeah.

Thanks.

I'm so sorry.

(SERVER SWEEPING UP GLASS)

sh*t.

She left from the front.

Thank you.

Tessa!

(SIGHS)

You're just never gonna

leave me alone, are you?

(SIGHS)

I tried.

My, my

How did I fall

in this hole again?

I should know better

than this

Better than this

Time flies

Funny when

you're getting older

I should know better

than this

Better than this

Think I fell too deep

and it hurt so hard

How you're getting me

to let my guard down...

So, you two have

a good Christmas?

O-kay,

you're not talkin'.

So... hey, so I was dreamin'

of a white Christmas.

Hmph! All I got was heat.

You know, I hate the heat.

Heat get into people's minds

and make them do

some crazy things.

(DRIVER TRILLS, LAUGHS)

Hardin: Like I said,

this is a story

you've heard before.

Only difference is,

this is our story.

Tessa's and mine.

"I never wish

to be parted from you

from this day on."

Hardin: And who knows?

Maybe there is a happy ending

for us after all.

MAN: Tess.

- Hey...

- TESSA: Hardin!

- Dad?

- "Dad"?

HARDIN: I guess we'll

just have to find out.

I'm afraid of the dark

I get lost in the thought

Of what I'll do-ooh-ooh

With you-ooh-ooh

I'm afraid of the dark

Always take it too far

When I'm with you-ooh-ooh

With you-ooh-ooh

Oh sh*t, I feel like Alice

Woke up in a rabbit hole

last night

Made it look like a palace

You broke in, even though

I left my door open

Now I'm taking sips

of your potion

Take control

of all my emotions

Think I fell too deep

and it hurts so hard

How you're getting me

to let my guard down for you

And you're bringing out

all the reckless parts

But I love it

Oh, I love it

I'm afraid of the dark

I get lost in the thought

Of what I'll do-ooh-ooh

With you-ooh-ooh

I'm afraid of the dark

Always take it too far

When I'm with you-ooh-ooh

With you-ooh-ooh

'Cause I kinda like

when I'm with

Tessa. (LOWERS VOICE)

Tessa.

(LOWER) Tessa.

Do you like to go on dates?

Because I don't.

But I-I will... with you.

If you wanna go.

(EXASPERATED LAUGH)

Tessa.

That's so creepy.

I've been meaning to tell you

something for a long time,

and the reason

that I haven't told you

is because of Human Resources

in the workplace.

Don't talk about

Human Resources.

That's not... sexy.

Tessa!

Don't do the finger.

Put it down!

I only pull out my teal suit

when I have something

important to say.

- (KNOCKING)

- Occupied.

- (LOW VOICE) Tessa.

- (KNOCKING)

There's other bathrooms

in the house

if you need to go that badly.

Just go.

Yes. You can go now.

(INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)
