Morning, sir.

Nothing good about it.

Get up!

Let’s go, get up.

[head guard] Let’s go boys. Let’s get this show on the road.

[guard 2] Come on! Come on!

[guard 3] Come on, get out of bed.

Let’s go, get up.

Clean this f***ing mess up.

[guard 4] Hey, Jackie, I need a hand.

[metal rattling]

Put some clothes on.

[Jackie whistling]

[guard 3] Diaz, what the f***?

[inmates moaning, chattering]

[keys jingle]

[lock clicking]

[guard 2] You got a joke for me today?

[man] Move!

[guard 2] All right, come on, let’s go, guys.

Move your f***ing ass. Move.

[guard 3] Don’t test me, Walters.

[guard] Come on, boys.

[guard 2] Get him on the ground.

[guard 4] Move your f***ing ass, Bullock.

[Bullock] F*** you!

[heavy struggling]

[Bullock] Get the f*** out my cell.

[can clattering]

[men grunting]

[Bullock] Leave me alone.

Hey, Arthur, you feelin’ crazy today or what?

[men fighting]

[Bullock] I don’t wanna come out today.

[Jackie] Take him down to F Ward.

[Bullock] I don’t wanna come out today.

You got a big day today. You better put on a happy face.

[Bullock] Get the f*** off me.

[guard] Let’s not do this again, Beanie.

[faint shouts, chatter]

[man] Shut up!

[Jackie] Let’s go, Arthur.

[guard 2] Come on, Fleck.

Don’t need your fancy lawyer blaming me if you’re late.

She knows how much you like me, right?

Hey, Fleck, you got a joke for us today?

[Jackie] Yeah, it’s been a while, hasn’t it?

[door lock buzzing]

[Jackie whistling “When the Saints Go Marching In”]

Move.

[inmate shuddering]

[faint shouts and yelling]

[guard] Right on the line.

Let’s go!

[Jackie] Back the f*** up, Ken.

[guard 2] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Go on, front of the line.

[Jackie] Fleck. Fleck’s next, my dear.

[guard] Hey, stay in line.

[young man] Yeah, you heard him.

[guard] Hey, hey, hey, back up.

[guard shouting in pain]

[guard] Freak bit me!

[overlapping shouts]

Go.

[guard] All that kid’s done since he got here is f***ing smile.

And today, all of a sudden, he bites Moran?

[Jackie] It’s because nobody likes Moran.

He was at Gotham State for, like, eight years

before he got here, and he’s still a f***ing temp.

[Jackie and guard laughing]

Hey, Fleck, you got a joke for us today?

[guard] I already asked him.

[Jackie] I got a joke for ya.

This guy’s dog dies, right? And he really loved this dog.

So, he goes down to the church, and he asks Father Mulcahy

if he’d perform a funeral for him. Right?

And Mulcahy says, “Oh, no. [stammering] I’m sorry my son,

we can’t have a service for an animal in our church.

Uh, but, I bet if you go down

to the veterinarian in town…”

[barber] F***.

[Jackie] “…he can do it for you. You see?”

[barber] Goddamn it, Arthur.

[Jackie] Uh, so the guy says, “Oh, thanks very much, Father.”

And he says, “Do you think two grand

would be enough to cover the service?”

Father Mulcahy looks at him…

“Why didn’t you tell me the dog was Catholic?”

[all laughing]

[razor clattering]

[Jackie laughing] Eh?

Clean yourself up.

You like that one, Arthur?

Let’s go. [chuckling]

[high voice] “Why didn’t you tell me the dog was a Catholic?”

[all laughing]

[thunder rumbling]

[sighing]

[faint chatter over P.A.]

[Jackie] Look around, Arthur.

This is how the other half lives.

[bearded guard] Could have been all yours

if you hadn’t killed five people.

[Jackie chuckles]

[bearded guard] One live on national TV.

[Jackie] Move, will ya? Moron.

[woman] Hey!

Come on. You f***ing lunatic.

[Jackie laughing]

[singing continues]

Jesus Christ, you couldn’t get him a f***ing umbrella?

Aw, come on, counselor,

you know we can’t give these boys umbrellas.

It’s for their own good.

Oh, don’t give me your sh*t. He’s soaking wet.

Well, those are the rules, counselor,

but I’ll break them if you ask me.

I bet you would.

[Jackie chuckles] Mm-hm.

Oh, you’re welcome, by the way,

for getting him all cleaned up for you.

[guards cracking up]

Sit down.

Here, Arthur.

[guards chattering faintly]

Today, we’re meeting with Dr. Beatty.

Remember her?

She’s gonna be videotaping you this time,

so we can show it at your competency hearing next week.

[guards chuckling faintly]

And if they find you competent,

and they will, they always do,

then we’re going to trial.

You need to be in an actual hospital with actual doctors.

Not this Department of Corrections…

bullshit with these thugs.

Dr. Beatty thinks that with everything

that happened to you in your childhood,

it caused a split…

this fragmentation in you…

[thunder rumbling]

…to help you cope with your pain.

She believes you have another person living inside of you.

And it was this other person who committed those crimes.

Do you understand what that means, Arthur?

[Dr. Beatty] I’ll be asking you a few questions today, Arthur, okay?

Maybe you don’t remember some things?

Or you’re confused about what you did?

I’m here to help you try and sort out what happened.

[tape recorder clicks]

Arthur, I’m not here only to help with your defense.

I’m here for you.

But for me to do my job,

I need you to be candid with me.

Does that make sense?

Can I have a cigarette?

[Dr. Beatty] Of course you can.

Let’s start with the first incident, okay?

The three men who accosted you on the subway, who bullied you,

did it feel like they triggered something painful?

From your past? Your childhood?Do you remember any of what happened?

Did you… black out?

See bright lights?

[Arthur] Mm…

Okay.

How about Murray Franklin?

What, if anything, do you remember about that night?

The music.

[Dr. Beatty] That’s good. Arthur, that is good.

Can I tell you what I remember about that night?

I remember you came out dressed as Joker.

And I remember Joker was dancing to that music.

Right?

I really liked his band.

My mom and I u… used to watch the show together.

[Dr. Beatty] She liked Murray Franklin as well?

[in falsetto voice] “He’s so handsome.

Look at those sparkling white teeth.”

Is that your mother’s voice?

[Arthur] Mm.

Do you often hear her voice in your head?

[inhaling]

[sighing] All the time.

[thunder rumbles faintly]

[chuckles weakly]

[Dr. Beatty] Did it change at all after she died?

What does that mean?

Did you…

this other part of you…

Joker…

Did it come out more after she died?

You lived together, right? In a one-bedroom apartment?

[cigarette crackling faintly]

Maybe I could talk to Joker about it.

Would he like to talk to me?

[trumpet playing “When the Saints Go Marching In”]

[overlapping chatter]

[young man] Hey, Arthur.

Arthur.

[younger guard] I mean, he’ll do anything. Anything.

The guards said you wanted to show me how to kiss.

But they said Joker’s a really good kisser.

Nobody’s ever gave me a kiss before.

[bearded guard] Twenty bucks says he chokes him.

[guards exclaiming, laughing]

[younger guard] There you go.

[bearded guard] Ricky don’t know what hit him.

[Jackie] There was no hesitation.

[younger guard] Yeah, yeah. [laughs]

[Jackie] Kinda like…

I gotta be honest with you, Arthur.

I wouldn’t have took you for a hopeless romantic.

Can I have a cigarette?

Why not.

Oh, no, no, no. What are you doing?

He doesn’t get a cigarette unless he tells a joke.

No, come on. He still makes us laugh, doesn’t he?

[younger guard scoffs] Barely.

[Jackie] Hey.

Remember that music class we saw?

The other day? B Ward?

Remember, with all the singing?

I got you in. We’re going next week.

[younger guard] Bullshit.

The f*** you do that for?

Eh, eh. No, no.

Went and saw Kellerman, I said…

you’ve been good. You deserve it.

[younger guard laughs] The hell is he thinking?

Yeah.

He knows he can get some good press for it.

Plus, I told him I’d go along with him.

[younger guard] Oh, ho, there it is.

That explains it.

[chuckles]

[bell clanging]

[yard guard] Count! Let’s go.

Line up by two.

Ricky. Come on, Romeo, line ’em up.

[Ricky] Let’s go. Twos. Line up by twos.

[younger guard] Come on, let’s go.

Are you being serious?

[Jackie] I am being serious.

On the Bible.

Wasn’t that hard, either.

Ever since they made that TV movie about you,

everybody still thinks you’re a star.

How about you, Arthur?

Do you still think you’re a star?

I bet you do, don’t you?

What about you?

I set fire to my parents’ apartment building.

[Jackie continues singing, indistinct]

Actually…

…it was six.

Nobody knows, but also I killed my mother.

[chuckles lightly]

I should have done that.

My mother had me committed.

She says I’m psychotic.

You know, I must’ve watched that TV movie

they made about you, like, 20 times.

Yeah. Was it good?

They won’t let me watch it.

It was good.

It was really good.

I grew up in the same neighborhood.

Me and my friends used to take that staircase

to school every day.

My parents didn’t give a f*** about me either.

My father beat the sh*t out of me.

Well, guess what?

“Knock, knock.”

“Sorry, kid, your dad was killed in a car accident.”

[sharp, wheezy laugh]

Sorry. That’s not funny.

[stifling laughter]

[both laughing]

If only those friends could see me now.

When I first saw Joker,

when I saw you on Murray Franklin,

the whole time I was watching, I kept thinking,

“I hope this guy blows his brains out.”

And then you did.

And for once in my life, I didn’t feel so alone anymore.

That I didn’t shoot first and let him ask me questions later.

That a joke, Arthur?

Yeah.

[laughs]

All it took was you getting a little old fashioned.

[Jackie laughs]

Thanks, pal.

[Jackie] Let’s get your medication.

Not guilty by reason of insanity makes no sense in this case.

He murdered five innocent people.

His depraved acts of violence…

[bearded guard] Hey, Fleck.

You’re on the news. …admired by his followers,

not only in our city, but all over the country.

Vandalism, arson…

The judge says you’re competent to stand trial.

I f***ing knew it.

And they are still willing to commit acts of violence

in his name.

Now, these people, they believe Arthur Fleck

to be some kind of… martyr.

[inmates murmuring] Well, he’s not.

Arthur Fleck is a monster,

who knew exactly what he was doing.

[inmate] Yep.

[inmate 2] Hear, hear.

And our office will be seeking the death penalty.

Thank you, we’ll be taking no questions today.

[inmate 3] Sh*t, bro.

I told you before, I set up…

Could you sign my book?

…an exclusive interview next month, right before trial.

Okay, but Kellerman asked me to make a statement now.

He’s letting me go to this movie tonight.

You know, like a normal person. What movie?

What are you talking about?

Come on, Arthur.

Okay. Um…

Yeah, I’m sorry. I have to go. Arthur, I told you…

Okay, let’s move it.

Well, hopefully, about your life in here,

and what the conditions are really like in this place.

He might ask you about Lee.

She’s been out there giving a lot of interviews about you.

And about herself.

Good.

You know, I love her.

She gets me.

Two minutes. Paddy’s ready.

Arthur.

This is a chance for you to show a different side of yourself.

So the public can see who you really are.

And I don’t think you should smoke.

I think it makes you look cavalier.

Okay.

We need to use this time

to show people that you’re human.

They need to understand you were sick. Delusional.

Mm-hm.

You’re not Joker. You’re Arthur Fleck.

[lawyer] Hm?

Don’t worry. You’re gonna be great.

[chuckles]

Arthur.

[chuckling] Are you okay? It’s…

It’s not too late to cancel.

[lighter clicks]

So, uh… you want me to call you Arthur or The Joker?

Mr. Meyers, you know we have an agreement.

You can’t call him “Joker.”

It’s Arthur. Arthur Fleck.

When you’re ready, Paddy.

[exhales]

She has to leave now.

You can watch from behind the glass,

but you can’t be in here.

[whispers] Just be yourself.

We rolling?

Rolling.

[Paddy clears throat]

[producer over radio] Cameras up.

[beeps]

Two years ago, the name Arthur Fleck

hit Gotham like a hurricane.

An unassuming part-time party clown

and struggling stand-up comic,

Fleck committed five horrific murders

in the span of just four weeks.

And now, with hundreds already lining up to get a seat

at one of the first trials ever broadcast live on TV,

Arthur Fleck, The Joker,

is sitting down for his first interview

since that infamous night on Murray Franklin.

And yes, we all know how that turned out.

[sharp laugh]

[Arthur clears throat]

Arthur Fleck, welcome.

Hello.

Take me back to that night onstage with Murray Franklin.

What was going through your mind…

when you pulled out that gun and blew his brains out?

Well, Paddy, um…

I was going through a lot back then. Um…

I don’t really remember much from that night. I, uh…

blacked out, I saw bright lights.

I was having a hard time

knowing the difference between what was real or not.

[Paddy] Oh, please.

You did it on live TV, pal.

Doesn’t get any more real than that.

Paddy, all I remember from that night

is I was gonna kill myself.

On television.

I thought Murray was playing a part in my show.

But he was a bad actor.

So he got what he deserved.

Your last joke, if we can call it a joke,

“You get what you bleeping deserve.”

That’s what you said.

That’s not fun, that’s not funny.

You’re right, I… I should have told a better one.

You’re trying to be funny now?

No.

Do you deserve to die?

The DA is calling for the death penalty.

You just said that you wanted to kill yourself on TV.

So, tell us…

…you still wanna die?

Well, at the time, it certainly seemed a lot easier than living.

Um, but that’s… that’s not me anymore.

That’s not…

That’s not who I am.

That wasn’t really you.

[stammering] No, that’s not right.

Let me get this straight.

That’s not what I meant.

So your defense is,

“It was The Joker who did it.”

An insanity defense.

Okay, I don’t…

I don’t know about a defense.

That this alternate personality,

this killer clown in you killed Murray.

Who am I speaking to now? Which one of you is here?

The poor, low IQ Arthur Fleck?

Or The Joker, who goaded a bunch of no-good punks…

Do you really care?

You don’t.

You’re just like Murray.

You’re just like everyone. You want sensationalism.

You don’t care about…

You just wanna talk about my mistakes.

You wanna talk about the things that I did in the past.

Not about who I am now.

Not how I’m different now.

That’s what we should be talking about, Paddy.

Okay, okay.

We should take a break.

We’re not taking a break.

[Paddy] All right.

Okay, so, tell us… what’s changed, Arthur?

Well, I’ll tell you what’s changed, Paddy.

I’m not alone anymore.

Right.

The girl who was singing. The night you tried to escape.

[chuckles] We weren’t trying to escape.

Miss Harley Quinzel.

You two put on quite a performance that night.

[Arthur] Aww…

She’s really something, isn’t she?

You tell me.

I mean, don’t you think it’s all…

…don’t you think it’s a little too much?

A little much?

[man on radio] The murder trial of Arthur Fleck

will begin today.

Assistant DA, Harvey Dent,

is preparing his opening remarks

in what some are calling, “The Trial of the Century.”

[woman on radio] After months of protests,

police will be on high alert, closing surrounding streets,

and setting up barricades for crowds

that could reach in the thousands.

[man] If you ask me, this is what you get

when there’s a complete breakdown of social services.

And don’t get me started on this media frenzy.

All right, Denise, you’re on the air.

[Denise] Thank you for taking my call. Enough is enough.

This idiot doesn’t deserve a trial.

He should be sent straight to the chair.An example should be made out of him.

Everything okay?

Yes, Your Majesty. I’m just looking for someone.

Please, Mr. Fleck, sit down.

I realize there’s a lot going on.

But this is still a court of law.

Any and all outbursts will not be tolerated.

And that applies to everyone in this courtroom.

Sidney, please call the case.

It’s my view that there is absolutely no evidence

that Arthur Fleck suffers from multiple personality disorder.

Or that he ever behaved in the role of “Joker,”

as a separate personality dissociated from himself.

[Dent] Doctor, in your opinion,

concerning the work you did on this case,

do you believe Mr. Fleck suffers from a mental disease or defect?

[doctor] No. In my opinion,

he’s not psychotic or unable to test reality.

I think he was sane when he committed these crimes.

In fact, I believe he fakes his mental illness.

[people murmuring]

[judge] Quiet.

[gavel rapping]

And… if he’s, uh…

…faking it, as you say,

then what is your opinion

on the defendant’s mental condition?

I believe he has four relatively minor

and quite common mental disorders

that involve long-standing sadness,

narcissistic self-centeredness, friendlessness,

an indifference to the feelings of others.

This is a very disturbed individual.

But I can’t give you any kind of psychiatric defense for him.

Thank you, Doctor Liu.

Nothing further, Your Honor.

[judge] Your witness, Ms. Stewart.

Thank you.

Doctor Liu, good morning.

[doctor] Morning.

How long did you interview Arthur Fleck for?

About two hours.

About two hours.

It was actually 89 minutes.

Tell me, how can you say for certain,

that Arthur isn’t mentally ill?

How can you be so sure after just 89 minutes,

that this “Joker”

isn’t a distinctly separate and split personality from him?

That that’s not who he is.

Well, I also reviewed all the test results.

Psychological tests, neurological and medical tests.

And in my view, it’s just a performance.

[crowd murmurs]

[Ms. Stewart] Did you read the records

from the Department of Social Services…

…that show that when Arthur was seven years old,

they returned him to his abuser’s home?

His mother’s home.

[pen scratching]

[doctor] I did, yes.

[Ms. Stewart] And when you interviewed him for 89 minutes,

did you ask him why Social Services

didn’t believe the horrific stories

a seven-year-old boy told them

about the physical and sexual abuse he suffered?

[faint, echoing laughter]

No, I… I didn’t ask him about that.

[Ms. Stewart] Hmm.

So you want us to believe,

that after spending just 89 minutes with Arthur Fleck,

and reading through his records and tests

from the same government agencies that abandoned him,

you want us to believe

that you can say with absolute certainty

that Arthur doesn’t suffer from any serious mental illness?

That he didn’t need to retreat into fantasy

and create another identity

to protect that scared, vulnerable, seven-year-old boy

from all the trauma and abuse he suffered?

And that that identity didn’t come out again,

when he was attacked and tormented

by three drunk bullies on the subway?

[three loud, echoing gunshots]

[gun clicking]

“After I woke up this morning,

I thought, ‘Murray, Murray, Murray.’

And then there’s Murray.

Funny, right?

Then I remember Sophie.

I had anoth…”

Objection. Your Honor…

Again, my client’s personal diary is privileged.

[judge] Overruled.

Again, as long as Mrs. Kane limits her comments

to Mr. Fleck’s journals…

But these are my own personal private jokes.

They weren’t meant to be read out loud.

Mr. Fleck. Quiet!

[gavel bangs]

[faint feedback squeal]

[judge] These are your words she’s reading.

And it’s up to the jury

to determine what to make of them.

Please proceed.

Ms. Kane, please continue reading

from the, uh… the highlighted portion.

“Then I remember Sophie.

Had another dream about her. Forgot it.

I almost never dream.

What do I gotta do to remember?”

[Dent] That’s Sophie Dumond, Mr. Fleck’s neighbor,

whom he was obsessed with.

What was that date?

November 17.

Let the record show,

November 17th is the day that Mr. Fleck

stabbed Randall Kleinmanhoffer to death.

The very same day that he shot and killed Murray Franklin.

Now, I know it’s not your area of expertise,

but you have read all of

Mr. Fleck’s journal before, correct?

[Mrs. Kane] Yes, I have.

And in your opinion,

does this sound like a different voice?

Like a different, uh… personality wrote this?

No, it sounds like Arthur.

[Dent] Go on.

He often wrote about his fantasies.

And… the… women he had imaginary relationships with.

And of course, his jokes.

There were always a lot of… these…

these unfunny jokes.

[crowd laughing]

[gavel banging]

[Ms. Stewart] She’s just a social worker.

I don’t think she’s even qualified…

You know, you’re making him out to be a f***ing idiot in there.

[reporters clamoring]

He’s never gonna get out if you keep this sh*t up.

Ask her why she has me sitting so far away from him.

Let’s not do this here. Please?

Do you see all those people out front?

Who do you think they’re here for?

How many T-shirts is Arthur Fleck on?

How many signs?

It’s the Trial of the Century

and she doesn’t even know who her own client is.

What do you mean by that?Can’t you see how sick he is?

How much help he needs?

He’s not sick.

He’s perfect.

You don’t really think he’s just gonna

walk out of here, do you?

[Lee] Yeah, he’s gonna walk right outta here.

With me by his side.

[reporter] And then what?

[reporter 2] Any further statements?

And then we’re gonna build a mountain.

[reporter 3] A what?

From a little hill.

[reporters clamoring]

What does that even mean?

Are you going to get married?

Move!

[Ms. Stewart] You’re not listening.

We can win this case, and she’s gonna f*** it all up.

No, you’re not listening.

Lee’s looking out for me.

[helicopter whirring outside]

She understands what I’ve been through.

What are you talking about?

We’re from the same neighborhood.

She lost her father. You know… her mom was awful to her.

She had her committed.

So just give her a break.

Okay, Lee cares about you, sure.

I know.

But she didn’t grow up in your neighborhood.

She lives on the Upper West Side with her parents.

Her father is not dead, he’s a doctor.

She voluntarily committed herself

to the hospital,

and then just checked herself out

when she wanted to.

She didn’t check herself out.

Arthur.

I was a bad influence on her, so they separated us.

Did she mention she went to grad school for psychiatry?

[giggling] You wouldn’t get it.

My point is she’s playing you for a fool.

I’m sorry, I just…

I know what it’s like to love somebody.

But I don’t think you can believe a word she says.

I just wanted you to like me.

Did you really check yourself in here?

[chuckling] Yeah.

That’s crazy.

Just… because you wanted to meet me?

Just to meet you.

You could have just wrote me a letter.

[chuckles]

And said what? I’m nobody.

I haven’t done anything with my life like you have.

Did you really watch that TV movie

they made about me 20 times?

Um… probably more like four or five.

[chuckles]

Was it actually good, or did you lie about that too?

It was great.

[murmurs, exhales]

My lawyer… says you’re playing me for a fool.

I’m no fool.

Can’t you see what she’s doing?

They’re laughing at you in there.

She doesn’t care about you.

I do.

Do you know I moved into your old apartment building

to make us a home for when you get out?

Did your lawyer tell you that?

[picks up cigarettes]

You did?

I don’t want to live there.

Did you think he was gonna hurt you?

Or your daughter?

[woman] I did, yes.

You believed he was dangerous.

[woman] Well, he broke into my apartment.

You call the police?

No.

His mother told me, uh…

that he’d had problems his whole life, but that he…

wouldn’t hurt a fly.

[dry chuckle]

[scattered laughter]

And…

…was the man who broke into your apartment that night,

was he different in any way from the Arthur Fleck you knew?

I didn’t really know him.

I saw him in the lobby, the elevator a few times.

Like I said, I knew his mother a little bit.

She was really sweet to my daughter.

[Dent] And Ms. Dumond,

why is it that you didn’t want to come here and testify today?

And why did you initially ignore our subpoenas?

Well, after Arthur did what he did,

the press wanted to talk to me about it.

And then I was a character

in that awful TV movie they made, and…

[whispers] It was awful?

Then all these people…

No.

…supporters, I guess, like the people outside,

started showing up at my work and harassing me,

blaming me for what happened to Arthur.

So I was afraid for my safety and for my daughter’s safety.We moved out of the city.

Well, then why did you finally decide to comply?

Because I should have called the police that night.

Then maybe all those people wouldn’t have been…

Maybe they wouldn’t be dead now if I did.

Thank you. No more questions.

[judge] Your witness, Ms. Stewart.

[Ms. Stewart] Ms. Dumond.

What happened after you asked Arthur

to leave your apartment that night?

He told me he was having a bad day. And then he left.

So, he never hurt or even threatened

you or your daughter?

[Sophie] No.

And did you watch him on TV on Murray Franklin the following week?

[Sophie] I did.

[Ms. Stewart] And did that seem like the same man

who was sitting in your apartment that night?

Did he sound the same or even look the same?

No, I mean, he was… he was wearing clown make-up.

[laughter]

[Ms. Stewart] And while Arthur’s mother

was being so sweet to your daughter,

what was she telling you about her own son?

Um…

She told me that there was something wrong with Arthur,

and that he lived in a fantasy world

and that he had this laugh.

[Ms. Stewart] She told you it was a “dumb laugh.”

That’s what she called it.

“His dumb laugh.”

[Sophie] Yes.

[Ms. Stewart] What else did she tell you?

That she made up a story, when he was a kid.

So that he would feel better about it.

So that he would stop crying,

so that he wouldn’t kill himself.

What was the story?

[Sophie] That he was put on this earth to bring joy.

Something like that. It’s why she called him “Happy.”

[Ms. Stewart] And?

[Sophie] And she…

couldn’t believe that he based his whole life

around this made-up story.

He was a street clown, and he wanted to be a comedian.

[laughter]

[Ms. Stewart] She made fun of him for doing that?

[Sophie] She just thought it was ridiculous

that he thought he could make people laugh.

I mean, she said Arthur wasn’t funny at all.

[laughter]

[voices fading]

[Ms. Stewart] Did she tell you that he had been

in and out of institutions his whole life?

[Sophie] Yes.

[Ms. Stewart] Did she say anything else about him?

[man on radio] Good evening, it’s 48 degrees at 6:00

on this Wednesday, November 8th.

I’m Stan L. Brooks and here’s what’s happening.

Shocking developments at the trial

of Arthur Fleck downtown today.

Fleck, the accused killer, also known as Joker,

interrupted testimony

and fired his lawyer Maryanne Stewart in open court.

Then he kissed her goodbye.

Afterwards, Fleck was extensively questioned

by Judge Herman Rothwax.

[judge] The right of self-representation

is not a license to abuse the dignity of the courtroom.

Can you control your emotions, Mr. Fleck?

[Arthur] Yes, sir.

[Brooks] Judge Rothwax reluctantly

approved Fleck’s request to represent himself,

as long as he agreed to stand-by counsel.

A decision that both Fleck’s now former attorney,

Maryanne Stewart and Assistant DA, Harvey Dent

disagree with.

[Ms. Stewart] It’s really tragic.

Arthur believes he has all of these supporters,

but they don’t care about him.

They care about Joker.

[continues on television] He’s not dealing with reality.

He’s mentally ill.

If we could have just convinced him of that

then we would have won this case.

[Dent] Fleck knows what he’s doing.

He knows he’s losing.

We cannot forget that he’s evil.

This is all just part of his plan.

[Brooks] The Arthur Fleck trial will resume on Monday morning.

In other news, Mayor Thorndike…

[cups banging on tables]

[Bullock] There he is.

[inmates cheering]

[younger guard] All right, calm down, everybody.

[bearded guard] Hey, shut the f*** up!

Sit down. Sit down.

Fleck, get off. Arthur!

[Bullock] Yeah, Arthur!

[younger guard] Hey, come on. Get off the table.

After reviewing all the case law that offers precedent,

Jensen v. Superior Court being the most relevant,

I have reluctantly decided

that Mr. Fleck does have the right

as an attorney, to dress himself how he likes…[loud cheer]

…as long as he doesn’t cause disorder

or interfere with the functioning of the Court.

I will not allow this proceeding

to become as unruly as it is outside.

And I will not let you

turn this into any more of a circus

than you already have.

[scattered laughter]

Thank you.

[judge] Mr. Dent, call your next witness.

The State calls Gary Puddles.

Bailiff?

Will you please escort Mr. Puddles to the stand?

[short chuckle]

[door opens]

[quiet, murmured laughter]

Gary.

Go get ’em. [chuckles lightly]

[bailiff] Please raise your right hand.

Do you solemnly swear that the testimony

you’re about to give is the whole truth

and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

[British accent] I do.

[Dent] Good morning, Mr. Puddles.

[light chuckle]

Thank you for being here.

[Dent] So one last question, sir.

The person who you saw

stab Randall Kleinmanhoffer to death,

are they in this courtroom here today?

Yes.

Can you point him out to all of us?

And… describe his clothing?

He’s… He’s sitting right there at the table.

Wearing a red suit and clown make-up.

[laughter]

[Dent] May the record reflect

the identification of the accused, Your Honor?

[judge] Yes, it will.

Nothing further, Your Honor.

[judge] Your witness, Mr. Fleck.

[sighing deeply]

[Southern accent] Mr. Puddles.

Gary Puddles?

Tell me, sir, is that your God-given name?

Yes.

Really?

[normal voice] Really? Your last name is Puddles?

[scoffing chuckle]

[Southern accent] Why, it sounds like a… a joke.

Well, it’s not.

[normal voice] You expect us to believe that your last name is Puddles?

Puddles?

[laughter]

Mr. Fleck, where is this going?

As I said, I’m not gonna let you turn my courtroom into a circus.

Okay.

But, um, with all due respect, Your Honor,

don’t you think it’s a little late for that?

Don’t try my patience.

[Arthur] Okay. Okay.

[clears throat]

[Southern accent] Mr. Puddles…

earlier this afternoon you testified

that you saw me stab Mr. Kliman Manhoff

in the neck a couple of times. Correct?

Kleinmanhoffer.

Yes, I saw you.

Mm.

And what else did you see that day?

[voice shaking] You stabbing him in the eye,

and bashing his head into the wall,

many, many times.

Yes, but, uh, Randall was a bit of a bully, wasn’t he?

He didn’t deserve to die.

I don’t know.

[scattered chuckling]

Eh, never mind.

Gary, did you catch my act

on The Murray Franklin Show later that night?

No, I didn’t.

No?

Might I remind you that you are under oath?

I was locked up at the police station.

In an interview room.

‘Cause they thought you might come and kill me.

I was the only witness.

They kept me in there all night.

Isn’t that convenient, Mr. Puddles?

That you didn’t see the show, you didn’t see anything I had to say,

[normal voice] I can’t believe it!

Mr. Fleck.

Okay. [clears throat]

[Southern accent] Uh, when you were in my mama’s apartment,

God rest her soul,

when, as you say, you saw me bash Mr. Klannonmen…

whatever’s… head into the wall, “many, many times,”

did I seem crazy to you?

Did I seem like a different person?

Or was I the same old Joker that I always been?

Arthur, don’t do this to yourself, it isn’t you.

[imitating accent] It isn’t me? So you don’t think this is me?

Well, maybe… maybe… you don’t know who I really was.

I never saw that side of you.

[Southern accent] Well, maybe you weren’t looking.

Maybe no one was.

Because nobody knew I existed.

But look around, look at all these people.

Everyone outside. These cameras.

Who do you think they see, Mr. Puddles?

[sniffling] Joker.

Oh, sweet child,

what you have proven here today, is that you are no different

than any of those people that underestimated me.

[normal voice] From Murray Franklin,

to those goddamn fat, stupid guards at Arkham.

They think that they can treat me like trash.

But I will no longer allow you,

or you, or you,

or any of you to keep me down.

I am free!

[crowd chattering]

[all cheering]

[Gary] Why are you doing this to me, Arthur?

What?

Gary, I like you.

I told you I wouldn’t hurt you, and I didn’t.

Not hurt me?

[crying softly]

I couldn’t go back to work.

I still can’t sleep, and I’m scared all the time.

I never used to be scared.

I’m scared right now, here. With you in front of me.

I couldn’t do anything that day.

I felt so small.

[sniffles] I was reminded how powerless I really am.

[Southern accent] Oh… you got a flair for the dramatic.

You are tugging at my heart strings, little Gary.

No more… no more questions, Your Honor.

Do you know what that feels like, Arthur?

[under breath] Oh, f***!

You were the only one at work who never made fun of me.

You were the only one that was nice to me.

[Gary crying]

I said, no more questions, Your Honor!

[Gary sniffling]

[judge] Very well, Mr. Puddles.

The court thanks you for your testimony.

Please step down, you’re excused.

[judge] Mr. Dent, call your next witness.

We’re not calling any more witnesses, Your Honor.

That is the State’s case.

The State rests.

[judge] Very well.

All right, Mr. Fleck,

at this point, you may mount your defense.

[clicks teeth]

The defense rests as well, Your Honor.

[excited murmuring in crowd]

[judge] Pardon?

Mr. Fleck, you don’t want to put on any defense?

No, Your Honor. The defense rests.

“Th-Th-Th-That’s all folks.”

[crowd cheering]

[judge] All right, all right.

[gavel banging]

All right.

[judge] That’s enough! This is a court of law!

With both sides having rested,

this court will recess until tomorrow morning at 9:30.

[man] You made our case for us, you f***ing idiot!

[man 2] You’re gonna fry for killing my son!

[man 3] Burn in hell!

[reporter] Anything you want to say?

[reporter 2] Arthur, will you be convicted?

[photographer] Arthur, over here.

[photographer 2] Let’s see that smile.

Where do you think you stand, Arthur?

[crowd murmuring]

[cameras clicking]

[reporter] What are you gonna do if they let you off?

You have no f***ing idea what it takes,

put a little bit of joy into this f***ing place.

Let me tell you one I used to do about my mother.

You can drop the act now.

My mother was…

Because we know

it’s only Arthur in there, okay?

[panting] And she only dated abusive guys.

Yeah, is that right?

And, I asked her, I said,

“Mom, why do you stay with your abusive boyfriend?”

And she said…

[high voice] “Beats the hell out of me.”

[laughing loudly]

[Jackie] I told you to drop it.

Oh, he liked it!

[feminine voice] Oh, Jackie…

aren’t you gonna buy me a drink first?

[Jackie] Let’s go, let’s go.

Let’s f***ing go!

A word of caution. This is not a comedy club.

You are not onstage.

[laughter]

[judge] Excuse me.

Do you need a short recess, sir?

[exhales slowly]

I… I wanted to come out here as Joker.

And I was gonna go on a… an angry rant.

[voice trembling] And blame all of you,

and everyone…

[breath shaking]

…for this f***ing miserable life.

[sniffles]

But it wouldn’t matter,

because I can’t do this anymore.

‘Cause I can’t be who you want me to be.

It was all just a fantasy.

[shuddering sigh]

There is no Joker.

[faint murmuring in crowd]

It’s just me.

[hushed whispering]

I-I killed six people.

I wish I didn’t, but I did.

A massive car bomb has gone off in downtown Gotham.

[Joker fan] Holy sh*t. Exploding just outside

the county courthouse…

[driver] Oh, my God. …where thousands had turned out

to hear the verdict in the Arthur Fleck trial.

Details are still coming in.

Continue to stay tuned…

[Joker fan] You okay?

…as we bring you the latest…

[Joker fan] You hurt?

…on this situation.

[Joker fan] Are you okay, man?

[driver] Is he all right?

[“My Life” resumes on radio]

[Joker fan] F***. F***ing A. Can you cut around it?

[driver] No, chill out, it’s red. It’s okay.

F***!

Calm down, man.

[Joker fan] This is just the beginning, man.

They’re gonna burn the whole f***ing city down now.

Someone blew up the courthouse.

We can go.

I escaped.

We’re not going away, Arthur.

All we had was the fantasy, and you gave up.

We were never going anywhere.

I’m that same guy you fell in love with.

I’m the same guy that murdered Murray Franklin.

No.

No, you’re not.

So, a psychopath walks into a bar,

and sees this famous clown sitting there all alone.

Totally drunk, it’s pathetic.

“I can’t believe you’re here,” he says.

“What a disappointment. I used to watch you on TV.

What can I get you?”

And this clown turns and says,

“Well, if you’re buying you can get me anything.”

“Perfect,” the psychopath says.

“How about I get you what you f***ing deserve?”
