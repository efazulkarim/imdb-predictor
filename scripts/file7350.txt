Rockport, Maine,
is the only home I've ever known.
I'll never forget
that spring in 1962.
My family's big adventure
was about to begin.
Do you, Miss Cluck Cluck,
take Walter Pigeon
to love, honor, and obey
as long as forever and ever?
Come on.
Well, do you?
Miss Cluck Cluck, wake up.
Come on, it's your wedding.
Well,
I pronounce you man and wife.
Any animal that had lost its way
or just needed a friend
was always welcomed at our house.
But the animals were tame
compared to my brother Steve
and my sister Paula.
I cannot believe
you would eat those things, period,
never mind for breakfast.
See, that shows how much you know.
Recent studies have shown
that Twinkies
have a shelf life of over 27 years.
Therefore, if I continue
to eat a daily ration
of these golden,
cream-filled delights,
I could live indefinitely, you know.
Mom, where's Dad?
I need hot-lunch money.
There are lunches all made up
in the fridge, Paula.
Steve, have you seen your father?
Dad said Mom
had the patience of Job.
She was wife, lawmaker,
zookeeper, and mother,
and she was also the only
real grown-up in the house.
Just a second.
Ohh! Hello?
Mrs. McCann, how are--
I saw them cutting
through my backyard again,
which is trespassing.
I'm very sorry--
You people are a menace.
This is Toni's report card,
which she conveniently
left at school.
And I do need to remind you
that Toni still does
not participate in class
and she does not join in
with the other children at recess.
And then there was Dad.
Do you see em?
Yeah.
He was my hero.
He had a special way with animals.
I thought it was magic,
and all these years later, Im certain of it.
You know,
you were doing the right thing.
I mean,
its about time they got hitched.
The neighbors were starting to talk.
What do you think went wrong with him and her?
Well, maybe him and her aint a him and her.
You mean I put the dress on the wrong one?
Well, Walter would know more about that than I would.
Okay, fine.
I guess you want me
to be a social outcast.
Dad, can I please have money for a hot lunch?
What did your mom say?
Shouldnt you be about halfway to school yourself?
Im not going. I hate school.
Well, I hated school, too.
However, Im gonna be late,
and youre gonna be in a world of manure
if we dont both get going, so off you go.
Isnt it beautiful?
Tonis gonna love it.
Oh, Toni, come here.
You have to see this.
Wow, its beautiful!
Joey Bailey gave it to me.
Were going steady.
Come closer
so you can get a better look.
Settle down!
Chatterboxes off, thinking caps on.
Brenda George,
please collect yesterdays spelling assignment.
And I expect to see a great improvement
over last week.
Remember, I before E except after C,
and sometimes Y.
Here.
Hey.
Hey.
Ready, huh?
Well, Harry, thats a good one.
You dont say?
You dont say?
You dont say?
All right, Ellwyn, who was it?
He didnt say.
Did you get it?
We get it.
We got it the first time you did it,
we got it the last 47 times you did it.
It aint funny.
You know, I laughed like hell when I heard that joke.
Ellwyn, its teatime.
Coffee and a bear claw.
Hey, Betsy?
Thats my name. Dont wear it out.
Whats the difference between a tourist and a canoe?
A canoe tips.
Get a new joke, for Petes sake.
Harry, you see this?
It used to be a fishing net.
A seal done it.
Ah, come on, Billy, it could have been anything.
It could have been an outboard motor.
It could have been a shark.
Oh, it was a seal, all right.
I cut it out myself.
Time was you could shoot a man
for stealing your catch.
I got no problem shooting seals.
Im warning you, Harry,
youre the harbormaster,
you better do something.
Now, Billy
Billy, wait a second.
Listen, dont go do something stupid, huh?
Look, youre wasting your breath, Harry.
Stupid is his middle name.
Down in Pine Harbor,
they just went down to the haul-outs
and blew them all away.
Well, thats just crazy and cruel.
Look, I know you guys are having a bad season,
but its got nothing to do with seals.
Well, what is it?
I dont know, but I guarantee you it aint seals.
Toni.
I found a sick frog, Dad. Can you fix him?
Well, I havent had much luck fixing stuff today,
but lets have a look.
Some kid at school
was winging him around by his leg,
and I think its broken.
Well, well see what we can do, huh?
Oh, yeah, I forgot to tell you,
Miss Cluck Cluck came home.
Oh. That should make Walter Pigeon very happy.
Not really. Shes not speaking to him.
Take it outside.
Steve, try this.
No, that one is not for the book, Mom.
Ill eat it, Mrs. Whitney.
Thanks, Gerald.
See, your friends like my cooking.
Quick, somebody call the hair police!
I want to make a citizens arrest.
Mom, dont you think I look like Lesley Gore?
Oh, you got the Gore part, all right.
Oh, youre so funny, I forgot to laugh.
Youd laugh if you looked in the mirror, you know.
Peabrain.
Oh, I know you are, but what am I?
I know you are, but what am I?
Enough! Leave me alone!
Mom!
Lesley Gore. Okay, Lesley Gore
Enough!
The next person who makes a noise
in this kitchen
is in the doghouse, and I mean it.
Out!
Morning, everybody.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Good morning, honey.
Gerald, what a surprise to see you here at mealtime.
Phew! Whats that smell?
It sure aint bacon and eggs.
Sorry Im late for breakfast.
Its been such a pleasant one so far.
Paula, what do you got there?
Its my science project.
I was supposed to study
the lowest form of life I could find,
but Steve wouldnt fit in a cage,
so I had to use a rat instead.
Oh, youre funny.
Moron.
Oh, yeah, I know you are, but what am I?
I know you are, but what am I?
You scare me, you loser
Hey, Dad, look.
Im taking Prince Charming in for show and tell today.
Hello, Prince.
Make sure he doesnt kiss the teacher.
She might turn into a toad.
Oh, its too late.
So after they told us Uncle Earl was dead,
we had to go to the funeral parlor,
where they had him laid out.
Uncle Earl used to be a boxer,
but now hes a fireman.
But they buried him in his boxing shoes anyways.
I know because my brother Danny,
he lifted up the lower part of the coffin
and we seen em.
And then Aunt Edna got real mad at Danny and me,
but she didnt hit us cause she was good and drunk.
Anyway, the cops finally came
and took her away in a straitjacket,
right to the state loony bin in Jackson.
Thats an interesting story, Bobby, but
why dont we give someone else a turn
at show and tell?
Mary, what do you have to share with us?
This is a Hawaiian lei from the island of Hawaii.
My cousin Robert brought it back
from his trip to the South Pacific.
The flowers in it are blue and orange,
cause my favorite color is blue,
and my best friend Elizabeths favorite color is orange.
My mother says Im not to let anyone else wear it.
Toni, dont you have something to show us today?
I got to post these new tide charts up
at the lobster pound.
Did you get the lumber and tar for the dock repairs?
Yeah, yeah, I did.
Morning.
Morning, Harry.
Morning, Billy.
Billy.
Nice to see you, too, Billy.
You have a nice day, now, huh?
You horses ass.
For crying out loud,
Im giving up trying to figure that guy out.
Oh, well,
when the fish arent biting--
hey, Im the harbormaster, not Mother Nature.
Jeez.
Its colder than a well diggers butt out here.
Id say its about time for a coffee now.
Come on.
Come on, take it.
Harry, you in there?
Yeah.
Have you seen my Sears catalogue?
Uh, yeah, I think its in the bathroom.
Well, weve got to order a new typewriter,
or Ill never get that cookbook finished.
Honey, the sweater. Come on.
And can we please, please, ohh, please,
clean out this barn?
We say were going to do it every spring,
and we never--
and look, you could make me a nice,
new office down here.
Good idea.
Im serious.
Me, too.
And all this junk in here,
weve got to get rid of it.
And that old tub, thats going right now
Oh, Mom!
What?
You missed it.
I missed what?
A red and white spotted hoot owl.
A fruit bat.
Yeah, a bat.
Dont you have some homework, young lady?
Well, Im...
Im gonna stay down here and help Dad.
Spell Mississippi.
M-I-S-S--
Ium
Oh, who cares, Mom? I live in Maine.
Inside.
Neat, Dad.
He came right up to the boat.
I swear he was gonna jump right in.
Hes sick.
Do you think he lost his mommy?
Probably hasnt eaten in a while.
I cant get him to take the bottle.
Come on.
It helps if you heat the milk.
When are you guys going to realize
I see all, I know all.
Look, Im just gonna wean him
and then Ill let him go, I promise.
When have I heard that before?
And you, young lady, back to your room.
Thank you very much. Go on.
I know something you dont know
Want to know?
No.
Its real neat.
Theres a baby seal in the barn.
Lets call him Moby, cause he comes from the sea.
So does seaweed, duh.
How about we call him Marky?
Oh, and that would be as in Marky Baker?
As in, "Oh, he's so cute!"
As in my diary,
That's an invasion of my privacy!
I could sue you!
Hey, nobody is going
to sue anybody, Paula.
Let's wash up for supper, come on.
You, too, Missy.
Come on. Hup, 2.
You know, there's just no information
about how to nurse a pup.
Harry, what are you thinking?
The fishermen are
trying to get rid of them
and here you're gonna adopt one?
Well, let me worry
about the fishermen.
And what about Toni?
She's already attached.
What if he dies?
What if you can't get him to eat?
Harry, I love animals
as much as you do,
you know that.
But sometimes,
you just have to let
nature take its course.
Nature did take its course.
You better get him to Doc McIntyre.
I know you're sad
and you miss your mom,
but please don't die.
I'll be your best friend forever...
and I'll take care of you always,
I promise.
And I love you.
Toni, look at this.
What's that?
Seals go around on their bellies,
so their nipples are inverted,
so I took this old bucket
and cut a hole in it,
put in some baby bottle nipples,
and covered it in
old wetsuit material, and
Presto, artificial mother...
I hope.
Dad, wake up.
Dad, look.
Well, I'll be.
What do you think we should call him?
How about Andre?
Andre?
Okay, Andre it is.
Down!
I'm sick of this.
Let's watch a game.
Okay, it's fine.
The old tub became
Andre's home until spring.
Everybody was happy,
except for Toot.
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny
Which nobody can deny
Which nobody can deny
For he's a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny
Happy Birthday, Andre.
After a year,
We still couldn't convince
Andre that he was a seal...
and my father that he wasn't one.
Come on.
Andre, come on in.
The water's fine.
Come on.
What are you, a seal or a mouse?
Who do I look like,
Nelson Rockefeller?
Didn't I just get you
a gun for your birthday?
I thought you'd be huntin' up
a storm with it,
but you ain't barely touched it.
I need a new baseball glove,
or I can't play.
The old one doesn't even fit.
When I was your age,
I didn't dare ask my father
for something I didn't need.
Dad, cast off the stern!
Get the other traps.
Got your lunch, boy?
Hi, Mark.
- Hi, Paula.
Class, I've allowed Toni Whitney...
to bring in something
that she considers
very special for show and tell.
This is the newest member
of our family.
He came to us from the wild,
and I named him Andre
after a famous seal trainer.
He's my best friend,
and our favorite color is blue.
Big deal.
Andre!
Be friends!
Ain't waitin' for no
go-ahead from nobody.
Popped off two more of 'em
just this mornin'.
Well, if it ain't Rockport's
very own harbormaster.
I've been out there all day, every day,
and I ain't seen him once this week.
Yep. And I almost ran aground
off Round Bay cause he didn't
replace the light in the buoy.
Got a seal for a pet.
Look, guys, I just wanted to
get him strong enough,
and back to the wild he'll go.
It's not fair.
I promised him when he got better
that I would take care of him.
He's my best friend.
Me and him are best friends.
I know, sweetie.
Andre knows how much you love him.
But sometimes,
when you really love someone,
you have to let them go.
And he belongs in the wild.
He does.
Mom...
He'll die.
Want to come along?
I'll bet Andre'd like it
if you did.
I found him out near Robinson's Rock.
Maybe he'll feel at
home out there, huh?
Toni. Can you keep a secret?
I mean really keep a secret?
Toni, since when
do you like herring?
And, Harry, why is there
herring in the fridge?
Oh, it's just for a friend.
A bad-smelling, fish-eating,
raspberry-blowing friend?
Good guess, Mom.
Harry Whitney, you knew that seal
was gonna come back here!
Well, they got a new dance
And it goes like this--
bup-buppedy-bup
bup-bup-bup-bup
Yeah, the name of the dance
is the peppermint twist
bup-buppedy-bup bup-bup-bup-bup
Well, you like it like this
The peppermint twist
bup-buppedy-bup bup-bup-bup-bup
around and round
up and down
around and round
and up and down
around and around
and up and down and
uh-1, 2, 3, kick, 1, 2, 3, jump
1, 2, 3, kick
"Andre will become
a real celebrity this fall
"If he accepts Ed Sullivan's offer
"to appear on his show.
"Now, to catch Andre's performance,
be at Rockport Town Wharf at 7:30."
Well. So, Harry,
how about an autograph?
No. Andre's the celebrity, not me.
No kiddin'? Ed Sullivan.
How many clams you get
for doin' that?
Ooh. Yeah.
Department of
National Marine Fisheries.
Yeah. Whos your chief enforcement officer?
Jack Adams.
Id like to talk to him.
All right.
Just a moment.
Harry Whitney?
Thats me.
You a reporter?
No. This is Jack Adams
from National Marine
Fisheries Service.
Youre in violation
of a federal law.
Yeah, I know all about that law.
Then why are you breaking it?
Well, the fact is,
Andres here because he wants to be.
Oh, yeah?
Whatd you do, ask him?
No. I let him go, and he came back.
Thats not what our sources say.
Well, its the truth.
Look, I can explain everything.
Yeah, you better, Mr. Whitney,
Cause otherwise,
were gonna take your animal,
and youre gonna
be the one in captivity.
Dad! Dad!
Come quick!
All right.
Im gonna have to report this.
You cant report him.
Hes gotta play second base
for the Red Sox.
Hi, Paula.
Hi, Mark.
Havent seen you around much.
You want to sign my yearbook?
Why should I?
Well, can I sign yours?
Im gonna enter
the Fourth of July
Miss Liberty contest.
Oh, yeah?
Yep.
Bet youll win.
Thanks.
So it must be pretty neat
being an only child.
I dont know.
My dad and I used to do
lots of things together.
But now its just Toni
and that stupid seal.
Its like Im not even there.
Do you like your dad?
Hes OK, I guess.
He was better before my mom had to...
had to go away.
But hes not prejudiced,
you know.
He hates everybody.
You know what I mean?
Its like...
I can tell him to do something,
and then I change
my voice completely,
and he still does
exactly the same thing.
Let me tell ya,
theyre a lot smarter than dogs.
Some dogs.
Oh, excuse me.
You think he understands
words then, Harry?
Yeah, right.
OK, OK, I know you think Im a nut,
but seems like hes got some kind
of built-in sonar.
I mean, he can hear and feel stuff
thats miles away.
Its unbelievable.
Ill say.
Hurry up!
Yeah!
Give it to me.
Mr. Whitney. Come quick.
Theres a problem down at the harbor.
Its with Andre.
Well, youll be back on time
for the Miss Liberty pageant, right?
I wouldnt miss it for the world.
OK.
Careful, Harry.
Hes as mad as a hornet
and drunk as a skunk, too.
Yeah, my favorite combination.
Billy!
What the hell are you doin?!
I warned you,
but you wouldnt listen to me.
Would you listen to me?!
Im tellin you,
Andres got nothin
to do with your catch!
Come on, Billy!
We grew up together!
I didnt like you then, either!
Ah! Come on, now.
Youre drunk.
Lets just go get a cup of coffee
and talk it over, huh?
Come on!
I could take you with my eyes closed!
YAAHH!
But youre not worth the energy.
Come on, Andre.
Come on, Andre.
Lets go home.
Come on, lets go home.
Andre, come on.
Im not kiddin around
now. Lets go.
All right, find your own way home.
You know, I dont get it.
Ive never done anything to Billy.
And if Im nice, it just
gets him more ticked off.
Well, Billys not your only problem.
What?
Bring me your tired, your poor...
I forgot.
You really messed up this time, Harry.
Paula?
Shes mad at you.
Paula, Im sorry I
missed your pageant.
But Andre was in trouble.
Shes not speaking to you.
Toni, I think we can do
without the running commentary.
You like that stupid Andre
more than me.
Hey, Andres not
stupid! Youre stupid!
Shut up.
Thats enough.
Its not fair.
You promised.
Didnt even go.
How can I make it up to you?
You cant.
Well...
Its been a big day for everybody.
Get some rest.
Tomorrows a brand-new day.
Sleep.
Good night.
I hate Andre.
Just shut up!
I wish hed go away.
Shut...up.
Oh, come on, Paula.
I know if you got
to know each other,
youd be friends.
I dont want to be
friends with him, Toni.
Oh, its not so bad.
Come on.
Come on, Paula.
I know you can love him, too.
Hey, Andre.
Look who it is.
Its Paula.
Oh, you stupid seal!
Nice goin, Andre.
Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea.
Could you hold on just one second?
Its Mrs. McCann.
Apparently, Andre
made an unscheduled stop
on his way home.
Harry!
I cant stand it anymore!
After the Mrs. McCann incident,
Mom figured Andre was watching
too much television.
But Im not sure
Andre shared her opinion.
Fall arrived,
which meant back to school.
Andre was not too happy,
and he found ways to show it.
Sorry, Andre, but I cant play
cause I have to go to school.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
You know, Ive been thinkin.
When I grow up,
you and me can travel
around the world.
And well never
have to go to school.
And we wont need anybody.
Well, maybe Mom and Dad can visit,
and, Steve.
But not Paula.
OK, Paula can come,
but only if shes nice to us.
Well, gotta go.
Just wanted to show you
my new fall coat.
Oh, no!
Look what you just did.
Now I'm gonna get it.
That was bad, Andre!
Bad boy!
Jeez. It's colder
than blue blazes out there.
Where the hell did summer go?
I thought Andre would've
been swimming south by now.
Yeah. I don't know what
I'm gonna do about that.
I mean, it scares me to death
he might've got too attached
to this place
to move south for the winter.
He's still pretty much of a pup,
you know.
This harbor freezes over well.
Yep. I expect those ice floes
could squish a seal pup's head
like a grape.
Real nice, Griff.
Well, you boys look great.
Now, no tricking, and I mean it.
Bye, hon. See ya.
What do you think?
This could be big trouble,
grounded till Christmas.
But it's worth it.
When I lift my hat,
pull on the rope, OK?
Trick or treat, smell my feet
Give me something good to eat
They did what?
They're a disgrace and a menace...
Mrs. McCann?
Mrs. McCann.
Mrs. McCann.
Steve!
Get down here now!
You are in a world of trouble.
This has got to stop,
and I mean now.
Oh, Dad, it was hilarious.
I mean, you should've
seen her yellin'.
I mean, you should've
seen her yellin'.
You are grounded for a week.
You will do every bit of yard work
that Mrs. McCann needs from
now on forever. You got it?!
Jeez, Dad,
you used to think
this stuff was funny.
It was so easy when they were little.
All I had to do
was carry 'em around on my shoulder,
and I was their hero.
Well, they're not little anymore.
Like it or not, they're growing up.
Did you know Steve got a weekend job
on Danny Snow's fishing boat?
Why didn't he talk to me about it?
I didn't even know he wanted to fish.
Harry, open your eyes.
There's a lot you don't know.
I'm sorry, Andre.
I didn't mean to yell at you.
It's just that it was a new coat,
and I'm always losing buttons and mittens and stuff.
Nobody will believe me that you took it.
Andre, come home.
Please.
By the time winter set in, we thought Andre
would've traveled south with the other seals.
But by now it was clear that Andre wasn't like other seals.
Andre!
Andre!
Andre!
Toni. Try that joke.
- Oh, OK, OK.
Andre! What do you think
about Mrs. McCann?!
What am I gonna do with you?
In January, the harbor froze over,
so Dad built a home
for Andre in the barn.
He was afraid that Andre
couldn't protect himself
in the wild because he'd
been around people too long.
But the winter weather grew bleaker,
and so did Andre's spirit.
He still not eatin'?
Well, let's try him halibut.
Thanks.
Harry? You remember Jack Adams?
Yeah. Hi.
I'd say this constitutes captivity, Mr. Whitney.
Wouldn't you agree?
Look, I'm just trying
to keep him safe.
I can't let him go.
It's too dangerous.
I'm not asking you now.
I'm telling you.
You comply with regulations,
or this animal gets
taken by the agency,
and you will face us in court.
No!
- Toni!
Sorry. She does that sometimes.
What the--
Must've called off school.
Hey!
- You played this song
87 times,
and I can't stand it anymore!
Mom!
Steve took my record!
All right, you two!
You're driving me crazy, Paula!
- Jeez, Harry.
Can't figure out why you're
so interested in critters
when you got yourself
a whole pack of wild ones at home.
He took my record!
Jerk! Get my record back!
Andre?
Andre?
Dad!
You knew he hated the barn.
You knew he'd run away.
It's all your fault.
Now he's gone.
You tell him.
When Andre didn't
come home that night,
I cried myself to sleep.
All that winter,
we kept hoping and praying
that he'd show up, but he didn't.
And every day, my heart grew heavier.
The snow melted, spring returned,
but not Andre.
Want some more ham?
I knew he'd come back!
Careful, honey.
A winter in the wild has
probably changed him.
Then again, maybe it hasn't.
No, this isn't Disneyland,
but this small New England
fishing village
has attracted almost as many
tourists this summer.
Ok, Andre, Andre,
smile for the camera.
Smile for the camera.
That's it.
Very good.
Why? Because of a seal named Andre
who has chosen to remain
with his adopted family
over life in the wild.
This is stupid.
Nothing personal, boys,
but you're about to be
baked, boiled, and fricasseed
into cold hard cash in my pocket.
I'd buy you a drink,
only you're not old enough.
Now, throw it back.
You just want to keep it?
Why don't you give it back to me?
Excuse me.
A man's got work to do here.
How about a hug, huh?
A big hug.
Yeah.
Okay, Dan, I'll tell him.
Harry, that was Dan Snow.
\He says he lost his mooring
and he needs you to dive for it.
You don't say.
Thanks, Ellwyn.
- Right. See you later, Harry.
You're one lucky son of a gun, Whitney.
You almost became
itty-bitty fish bait.
Yeah, says who?
The Coast Guard.
It was active.
Some kind of explosive
from who knows where.
No kidding.
Huh.
I thought he'd gone nutty.
He was trying to warn me.
Well, he can read now?
Without moving his lips.
He should have been an astronaut, Harry.
Yeah, first seal on the moon.
Hey.
Hi, buddy.
I guess I owe you one, don't I?
What are you trying to tell me, Andre?
What?
What the hell are you two doing?
- Nothing, Dad.
Give it here.
That's it, Paula, you're
grounded for a week.
And you, get out of here now.
I don't want to see you
back here ever.
Look, Mr. Whitney, I'm sorry.
You're sorry, all right.
And you're not fit to be around my daughter.
Yeah? Well, my dad says that--
He says that you're not fit to be harbormaster.
What?
He also says that--
That you're a big jerk!
You stay away from him, Paula.
I mean it.
You don't even know him!
Yeah, like father, like son.
Oh, dear!
He is so unfair!
He doesn't care about me!
- Oh, of course he does.
He loves you very much.
He just has his way of showing it.
You know, when you were born,
he tried to take a front page ad
out in the newspaper.
I'm not kidding.
And he was so mad
when they put you on the 11th page
with all the other birth announcements.
Oh, Paula, he was so proud of you.
He still is.
No, he's not.
He doesn't care at all.
And I don't know why you
always stand up for him.
I hate him!
Oh, I hate him!
Don't you ever, ever
say that about your father again!
Do you hear me, young lady?
Well, Paula didn't leave.
And by the time the first snow fell,
Dad was having trouble with
more than just my sister.
Hey, Steve. How's it goin'?
Hey, Dan Snow says you're
doing a great job
helping him out.
I'm proud of you, son.
I'm real proud.
Dad, the guys are voting
you out next election.
Oh, not you, too.
They don't think you look out
For their interests at all.
I mean, you don't check moorings.
You never set prices.
When's the last time you called a meeting, Dad?
They hardly ever see you.
I gotta hear about it all day.
Look, I don't need this from a 15-year-old.
I'm 16, Dad!
16!
Steve!
Look, you know I'm not just playing around out there.
I mean, something like this just
It never comes along.
Well, according to Jack Adams,
you could go to jail.
Nobody's gonna put me in jail.
Harry, you can't afford to lose your job.
What I'm learning from Andre
could completely change the way
people think about wild animals,
maybe even save lives.
And what about your kids' lives?
What about my life?
Thalice.
Ok.
Ok.
I'll give him up.
I'll call Jack Adams.
He can pick him up tomorrow.
I'll put him in the aquarium.
Listen.
Don't say anything yet, OK?
Let me figure out a way to tell Toni.
I love you.
Yeah, I love you, too.
Hey, Toni, listen,
I need to talk to you about something, and...
Hello?
Yeah, Griff.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's a problem for the fishermen.
I know. He's the cause of everybody's troubles.
I wish he'd just swim away.
Maybe he just needs some help.
I know how we can make him go away.
So he'll never come back.
Never?
No kidding. Yeah, I had a feeling it was him.
Yeah, thanks, Griff.
- What?
Billy Baker's the one who's been sicking
those mammal protection feds on me.
Harry, keep your cool.
That is it. I'm having it out
with him once and for all.
Andre!
Severe small craft
warnings have been posted...
Mom, Paula and Mark just
took off in the boat
and they got Andre.
They stole him.
They what?
- They stole him!
Steve, keep an eye on your sister,
please?
4 in 1.
The tire with true traction
that grips the road
and with smooth travel
no matter what the weather.
I am sick of this!
What is your problem?
You are!
You are, you son of a
The great Harry
great job, great house.
Great family, great guy!
I can barely feed my boy.
Well, how is that my fault?
I didn't ask to be no celebrity, no.
But I would have made
a hell of a lot better
harbormaster than you.
Harry! Harry!
Paula and Mark are out in the boat.
They've got Andre.
- What?
There's a small craft warning.
What are you doing?
You said we'd just drop him off
so he could swim south, right?
If we let him go,
he'll just come back.
This is the only way, Paula.
No!
- Let go of the gun!
You can't shoot him!
No!
Andre?
What have you done?
I wanna go home!
Paula, I'm sorry.
It's your fault, you jerk!
Move!
We didn't mean it.
We didn't want to hurt him.
Calm down, honey.
Slow down.
Tell me what happened.
Andre's gone.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it!
Come on, let's get in the car.
Dad, I'm sorry
- Boy, I could kick your ass.
Mom! Mom!
She just disappeared.
I was watching TV
and when I turned around,
she was gone. I'm sorry.
Her dinghy's gone, too, Dad.
Now get in the car and stay there.
Look, I know these waters.
With that southeastern blowing,
that little dinghy
could current on down
I think you've done enough.
Just get the hell out of here!
Stop it!
Just stop it!
My baby is in trouble
because of the two of you.
Now just find her, for God's sakes.
I'm gonna call the Coast Guard.
I need the Coast Guard, please!
Come on.
Come on!
Tide's pulling out.
If she started out from your place,
she's headed for Rocky Point.
Dad, I'm coming with you!
Help me.
Help!
Somebody help!
Do you see anything?
- Nothing!
Help!
Help me!
Help!
Somebody help me!
Andre!
Well, I'll be.
Andre!
Where'd you go, Andre?
Dad! Dad!
I'm over here!
Help!
Help!
Mark, no!
Mark!
- Help!
Help!
Ok. It's ok now.
Come in, Rockport Coast Guard.
This is vessel M-E-902-J.
Come in, over.
Yeah, this is Billy Baker.
Tell Thalice that Toni's ok.
We're coming in.
- It's all right.
Over and out.
I'm proud of you, boy.
Toni! Oh, baby.
Come here. Thank God.
Don't you ever do
that to me again.
Toni! Toni!
Let him go!
It's ok. It's ok.
It's ok.
Honey, it's all right.
I told him to come.
Listen, Andre's gonna go live
in the aquarium now.
But why?
He saved my life.
I know, honey, listen.
Remember when Andre
came home last spring?
How beaten up he was?
Well, Andre's done so much for us,
we need to do this for him.
It's too dangerous here.
He might not make it
through another winter.
When you love somebody,
you do whatever it takes
to keep them safe.
I'm so sorry.
- That's ok. It's all right.
I don't know what I'd do
if anything ever happened to you.
You know we're gonna
take good care of him.
And everyone at the aquarium
is going to love having him with us.
And you get to visit him
whenever you want.
Ok?
Ok, but he doesn't
like smelt or halibut.
His favorite fish is herring.
And he needs a belly rub
at least once a day,
and he needs to be
around a lot of people.
Well, he'll always have me.
Well, I love you, Andre.
And I'll visit you all the time,
even if I have to walk to Boston.
Don't worry.
He'll be ok.
Hey, boys. Congratulate me.
- Yeah, what's up?
I've been offered a job
with the Marine Mammal
Protection Agency.
What, you going to
be a fed now, Harry,
wear one of them green hats?
They wanna pay me
to do research for them.
What, are you going to wear a badge?
Do you get to wear a gun?
- Hey, listen up, everybody.
I wanna say something.
Well, since I'm such a
terrible harbormaster anyway,
I've decided to step down.
And, uh...
Well, you know elections
are coming up.
Well, I'd like to
nominate Billy Baker.
Everybody hates a harbormaster,
so it's a perfect job for me.
All kidding aside...
I know this harbor
better than anybody.
And I'm gonna work
my butt off for you.
One thing's for sure.
I gotta be better than Harry.
Hey, look,
it's on. It's on.
Rockport, Maine, as many of us know,
has been put on the map
because of Andre the seal.
He's attracted a record
number of visitors
to his new home at the
Eastern Aquarium near Boston.
Andre's nightly shows
at Rockport's dockside,
made him a national celebrity.
But the seal's owner, Harry Whitney,
placed him in the aquarium last fall
for his own safety.
Alfred Davis,
the aquarium's director,
says that Andre is
well-loved and cared for
and seems to be
adapting well to captivity.
Come on.
It's a long drive to Boston.
And I know Andre is
anxious to see you.
Dad, I've been thinking.
Yeah, about what?
Well, maybe Andre would like it more
with the other seals.
He is a wild animal, you know,
so I think he'd like it
better in the wild.
Well, Miss Whitney,
what do you recommend?
It was a long trip to Boston.
I knew I'd made the hardest
decision of my life.
I was about to say goodbye
to my best friend
for the last time.
That's it. Great. OK.
OK. Good.
I'm gonna miss him.
We've become good friends, huh?
He should be able to live
in the wild if he wants to.
Well, some of his own
will prepare him for the winter.
We really appreciate
everything you've done for him.
Well, Andre, you'll be ok.
Love you.
OK, there we go.
That's a boy, Andre.
Go on, Andre.
Dad...
Do you think Andre's
making new friends
with the wild seals?
I hope so, honey.
Hey, Harry.
That was Dwayne in Nantucket.
He says his friend Buddy Clemmons
spotted Andre off Rhode Island.
Criminy.
I guess he decided to head
for southern waters after all, huh?
Go on.
You know, Dad, I kinda miss Andre.
No way, Al.
You probably just saw a seal
that looks like him.
Buddy Clemmons thinks he saw him
off Rhode Island this morning.
You're listening to Sully Sullivan
on WROC, the station to listen to
for Andre updates.
If you think you've spotted him,
call in on the WROC hot line
at 555-1120.
In the last 2 days, there have been
multiple sightings of
Rockport's famous seal.
I can't find the
ball scores anywhere.
Look, Andre got pretty
famous in his day.
Every seal people see for
awhile is going to be Andre.
Yeah, but Mr. Whitney, isn't it true
that there have been
multiple sightings
on the eastern seaboard
in the last 2 days?
Sure. Maryland, Canada.
I expect they'll be calling me
from California next.
Thalice, it's Lou down
at Friendship Bay.
He's on his way.
Hurry up!
Did ya hear?
What's going on?
- He's coming.
Yay! Whoo!
Hey, Andre!
Hey, Andre.
Welcome home.
Many years ago, a seal called Andre
made his first historic swim home,
and his life became legend.
Every winter, he lived the life
of a country gentleman
at the aquarium.
Every spring, my dad set him free.
And every time, Andre made
the 250-mile journey home
to spend the summer with us,
his family.
By the time Andre was 24-years old,
he could hardly see,
but that didn't stop him
from completing his final trip.
In all my journeys since my youth,
and on all the journeys
I have ahead of me,
I know I'll never find
a better friend than Andre.
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh

Showin' me what the word means
What I've been dreaming of

Thanks to you
For teachin' me how to live
Putting things in perspective
Showin' me how to give

With the love I feel inside
Thanks to you

Raspberry-blowin' friend
Now when you hear that funny sound

He's the coolest mammal
From way down deep in the ocean
He causes a commotion
When he lets that raspberry blow
You're my best friend
My very best friend
Who's that now?
My one and only raspberry-blowin' friend
1, 2, you know what to do
You're my best friend
He's your best friend
