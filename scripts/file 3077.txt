It's just the heat. That's all.

You want me to stop? I can stop.

No, I think I just gotta

get my pills.

Oh, pull over.

Alright, Scarlett.

"The charm of yesterday,

the convenience of tomorrow."

Sh*t. I mean, it's so wrong,

it's right.

- You seem to be feeling better.

- Yeah, brand new.

I think I puked it all out.

God, where the hell are we?

I don't know. Some old

town like a million others.

I swear I've been here before.

This place? No. All these

old towns look the same.

Oh, like this place? No way.

Whoa. I wonder

what the rooms are like.

Tiny bathrooms and musty carpet.

If you're feeling better,

we should really get going.

What? We can't not stay here.

You go get the bags...

and I'll get us a room.

We're on the end.

What the f***?

What?

There's mud

in the bathtub.

You're not gonna take a bath,

are you?

I guess I wasn't, no.

Well, then don't worry about it.

I like this room.

- You do?

- I got a surprise for us.

Where'd you get that?

Front desk runs

little concessions.

Strictly on the downlow.

And those are?

Southwest shot glasses.

Muy autntico.

Nice. But didn't you leave lunch

by the side of the road?

It's old news. I think

it was just a passing thing.

- Cheers.

- Cheers.

Ah!

So now what?

What is the worst thing

that you've ever done?

- Truth or dare?

- Sure.

Like, the meanest, most rotten,

horrible, dirtiest,

dishonorable, despicable thing

that you've ever done.

I took the five finger discount

on these back in Santa Fe.

Is that not what you meant?

- What about you?

- What?

What's the worst thing

you've ever done?

- Seriously?

- Yeah.

My mum's sister, Polly,

died in a car accident

when I was really young

and her son Wayne was in the car

with her but didn't die. He...

He kind of turned into

this vegetable.

So... Wayne kind of

became my doll.

I would dress him up

in my mom's clothes

and plaster his face

with make-up

and I would put on these little

plays with him as the star.

I really shouldn't

have been watching him,

but I mean, there was, like,

no one else. So...

I mean, I was so young

and he kind of sickened me.

I mean, he smelt, particularly

when he took a sh*t.

He just constantly had this

drool running down his face.

So... I kind of started

f***ing with him.

I drew a bull's-eye on his head

with a red lipstick

and I would throw soft fruit

at him, like target practice.

And when he shat himself I would

just wheel him into a closet

and leave him there all day

until my mom came home.

And I was, like, a girl

interested in sex and boys.

I would take off

all of Wayne's clothes

and, one day, I put

peanut butter, like, all over

and just let the dog

come and lick it up.

And then I would kind of jerk

him off and watch him get hard.

And... I mean,

at the end of the day,

he was covered with whatever

I threw and I dumped on him,

and I would just wheel him

outside and just hose him down.

And if it was raining,

I would just leave him out there

for hours.

And then I would wash him

sometimes in the kiddie pool.

And I would just let him

slip in the water

until there were no bubbles

or anything

and his face would be, like,

red and purple and...

And then, you know, I would

save him just at the right time.

My mom had a boyfriend, this

Gulf War vet, complete a**hole.

We were all watching TV one

night and he mentioned how...

Wayne was doing really weird

things with his eyeballs.

Wayne's dad was a Marine.

It turns out he was doing

Morse code with his eyes.

He was saying,

"SOS, SOS, SOS, SOS."

I mean, over and over and over.

Oh, my God.

Do you see what I just did?

That is the worst thing

that I've ever done.

Ah... Oh.

Let's go get a real drink.

Yeah, let's get

out of this room.

All I need is some sunshine

All I need

All I need is some sunshine

All I need

The siren called

beyond the treeline

With another one

for the caves

We reached the moon

falls icy cauldron

And found the spirit

that I crave

All I need is some sunshine

All I need

All I need is some sunshine

All I need

Black water (pull me down)

Black water (pull me down)

Black water (pull me down)

Black water (pull me down)

Black water (pull me down)

Black water (pull me down)

Black water (pull me down)

Black water (pull me down)

It's a hard road

we've got to travel.

It's a road that is

not fit for them

who want to take

the easiest route.

Because the easiest route

has been paved smooth

by the tramplings

of sin and perdition.

No, the road we travel with

Jesus is a road that's uneven.

It's a road that's not to be

chosen by its even-ness,

by its length.

It's a road that's chosen

by virtue of its destination.

Of where we're going.

Of where we're all going.

Scarlett?

What are you doing?

Did you turn on the TV?

Are you crying?

I thought I heard someone.

I'm just hearing...

Who? Who are you talking about?

I heard someone talking to me

in the room.

There's no one in here.

You're probably still sick,

and all that tequila,

don't you think?

Yeah.

Come to bed.

OK.

Hey! Was that you last night?

You were looking up at our room.

Hey, let's shake a tail.

LA is not gonna drive to us.

How are you not hung over?

Desert air? Good genes?

I don't know.

They don't want you

to know the truth.

No, that fork-tongued

speaker of calumny

shall rassle you down...

Check it out. You think that's

the a**hole who woke me up?

Everything that you thought

was rued shall recede!

We shall be rassled down!

The walls that keep you,

the woman beside you...

God, it's beautiful.

Scarlett.

- Scarlett?

- Ah!

Scarlett.

- Can you turn around?

- What?

Stop the car! Stop!

What is it? What's going on?

I don't know, it's like I feel

like I'm being crushed

and then...

like, then next I'm falling

1,000 feet from the sky.

We... We need a doctor.

I don't think

there's a doctor for this.

What do you mean?

I think we just have to go back.

What?

Let's make it to the next town.

No, the further away I get,

the worse it gets.

Further...

Sh*t.

Please.

OK, I'm turning around.

Isn't that the church

from the TV?

Go. Drive.

Drive! Go!

I'm sorry, OK?

I don't know what to say.

Is there anything

I can do to help?

No. I think I just need to rest.

OK.

You rest, I'll just sit here

until you fall asleep.

No, you don't have to do that.

It's sweet. You should just go.

Go downstairs, have a beer.

Go on, go. I need to sleep.

I don't feel good.

El Rancho?

Hang on a second.

It's for you.

Hello?

Alex.

Hello?

Alex.

Scarlett?

I think I know him.

Who? The guy on TV?

I know how it sounds.

Scarlett.

I think he's trying

to tell me something.

Something important.

Jesus, I forgive my children...

Alex...

I don't know why

I feel so crazy.

I just feel like

I know this town.

So let's just go.

Let's get out of here.

We'll be in LA by morning.

OK.

- Scarlett?

- Oh, Alex.

Oh, my head.

It feels like

it's going to explode.

Scarlett, just...
We have to go back.

I don't want you to worry.

We're going to find a doctor

tomorrow for you.

Call someone and get someone

to come out here and pick us up.

Promise me.

We'll get out of here tomorrow.

Promise.

All I need is some sunshine

All I need

Front desk,

can I help you?

Hello. I wanted to see

if I had any messages.

Hello? Hello?

Hello?

Scarlett?

- Hello?

- You only lost your girl.

Well, I tell you what.

It seems only right

I should help you find her.

- Who is this? What the f***?

- What a thing to say.

Here I am,

trying to be neighborly.

I may be the only one

who understands you

- in this godforsaken town.

- I don't know who you are or...

Just a man, Alex.

What do you want? Tell me.

Let's start with you telling me

your particulars.

- What does she look like?

- What?

I hear she's a real looker.

Don't let the red cross

fool you.

She ain't fit to...

of the Lord.

Of course,

maybe she's sleepwalking,

like a detached witness,

as if she's watching a movie

or listening to the radio.

Is that girl a sleepwalker,

Alex?

Where are you?

In there.

In where?

- In there.

With you.

Lose something?

No, sir, I just thought

I'd take myself a little look.

You know, sometimes I hear

even the mouse chases the cat.

F***ing mouse.

I tell you what, why don't

we go for a little drive?

Are you starting

to feel it then?

You're taking me to Scarlett.

That's where you're taking me,

isn't it?

Hey! Schilter!

How about you put on that radio?

Let's hear some of that

good old spiritual music.

He can be found

in a mother's smile

He can be found

in the eyes of a child ...

They sure don't make songs

like they used to.

It's louder because

they know we're here.

All this time

and they never give up.

Who? Who are you talking about?

Well, that's the real story

right there.

Well, I never really took

to people much.

That's just the truth.

But I didn't like to be

all by my lonesome either.

So I found people of my choosing

and I took them out here.

What I do first is I dig a hole,

a nice deep hole,

and I make them watch

as I dig it.

And then I take the person.

Let's say it's you,

or your girlfriend.

Let's say it's Scarlett, and

I take her, just for instance.

And I throw her in the hole

and I bury her.

I bury her alive

and she never ever dies.

She lives for all eternity

under a heavy darkness of dirt,

reaping what she sowed.

- This is impossible.

- Impossible?

Just ask them.

They all have a story.

Hundreds of them.

Thousands.

Oh...

A city of pain under our feet.

Oh, pain's a beautiful thing.

In the end, it's the only thing

we really deserve.

It is only due

to the concept of guilt

we allow ourselves to see

ourselves as imperfect.

Our ego depends on guilt

for its survival as it allows us

to separate the world into

different objects

which we then call

"good" and "evil."

There is no good and evil.

There is only perfection.

Father, I'm gonna thank you

for your son Jesus

who died on the cross for me.

For my sins, not only for

my sins, but for my fears.

I'm gonna thank you for your son

Jesus who makes me whole,

in my spirit, in my body,

in my soul.

I want to thank you, Father,

for your son Jesus

who helped me sever the ties

between previous generations,

- from that bad blood...

- Hello.

I'm the whole operation,

so I need to loop it

if I want to take a break.

Want coffee?

When Slocum sailed the world...

he'd tie himself to the masthead

when he wanted to sleep.

Me, I got no such methods, no.

My work is my word,

it cannot be rigged up.

Whiskey in your coffee?

What is this place?

Well, if I say it's a church

then it's a church.

If I say I speak to God

then there is a God

that is spoken to.

There was a man.

Dirty hands, rings.

This smile.

Smile, well, that's a crime.

There's the thin wedge.

It was cut into his face

like with a knife.

You're talking about

the angel of the bottomless pit.

That's an ordinarily fella

with the wretched odor

of a million painful deaths

on him.

But pain...

is a beautiful thing.

In the end, that's all we got.

You're gonna have to excuse me

for just a spot, son.

Have a look around.

But do your best to keep quiet.

Do me a favor,

hit that record switch for me.

Spare me the indignity

of having my audience see me

scurry up onto my own set.

Son, I promise you,

we will get back to

our conversation momentarily.

But first, the work of the Lord,

then the work of man, alright?

Hit the button.

And just as soon as

that there sun shines down

with its warmth and light

on all things equally,

so too will guilt enwrap you

like a plague.

And drown you in sorrow.

Now, when we imagine things, we

start creating them in our mind.

We open the door

to our hearts...

Open your mind and then...

You must be very careful

about what things

you allow yourself to focus on,

lest they become real.

Lest the ethereal becomes poor.

Lest your fantasy

becomes reality.

You have to avoid these things.

There is Satan waiting to open

the door to your heart

and walk in. So you have to be

very careful about the images

you allow yourself to focus on.

And it's like one moment

you're being crushed,

and the next you're falling from

1,000 feet up in the sky.

I don't know, it's like

I feel I'm being crushed

and the next I'm falling,

like, 1,000 feet from the sky.

- Hey, what are you doing?

- How do you know what she said?

You can't just interrupt me

- mid-sermon.

- Why is this here?

What is this?

It's a mememto.

It's all I have left of her,

- so mind how you handle it.

- Is she here?

Scarlett? Scarlett?

I'm the only one who's here,

Alex.

How do you know my name?

why wouldn't I know your name?

You've been running around with

my daughter, haven't you?

Daughter?

Scarlett's father is dead.

She told you that?

Well, that cuts the

patriarch right to the quick.

I don't say

I don't deserve it, though.

It's true I knocked her around

a time or two.

But...

My tiddling is strictly

medicinal now, you understand.

Bingo.

Here.

It ain't there, son.

There you go. Hold still, son.

You can't die

if you ain't alive.

What did you say?

This is hell.

- We're in hell, aren't we?

- No.

I'm dead. We're all dead.

People tend to focus on

the world that's around them

rather than the world

that's within them.

Oh!

Tell me what this is.

- It's murder, if you do this.

- No!

Tell me what this is!

God damnit, I don't know!

Ow, f***!

No, OK, OK, OK, it's a dream.

- There we go.

- I'm dreaming all of this.

No!

No, the divine plan

is in play here, son.

You can either take charge

and fight your way through it,

or you can continue to be

a pansy ass spectator.

What's it gonna be?

What's it gonna be?!

- I don't know.

- Enjoy the ride.

No, I don't understand!

You said this is all a dream.

Yes, it is all a dream.

But you ain't dreaming nothing.

Scarlett is.

Hey.

Sit down.

You OK, honey?

Uh-huh.I have so much to do today.

I have to go buy Isabella a gift

and then I have to go get

a manicure and pedicure.

But they messed up

the appointment

so I'm supposed to go there

for 4:
30 but...

That's it.

Get that, hon?

Hey.

What, are you not gonna

let me in?

What are you doing?

Where have you been?

Hey, you don't answer your phone

calls, no email, nothing.

Jensen's pissed.

And I saved your ass.

I talked to the Rancho clients

myself, f*** you very much.

- Clients? What clients?

- What are you talking about?

You said Rancho?

What do you mean?

What do you mean,

"what do I mean?"

You just said Rancho.

What is Rancho?

El Rancho Estates.

The deal we've been

putting together

for the last four

f***ing months.

What's going on here, Alex?

Are you OK?

Paige, is he OK?

Hey, come on, man,

I was just trying... Alex!

Alex?

What are you doing?

Come to bed.

It's time now for

your national forecast...

Easy.

You want me to get you

in the mood?

Relax, Alex.

Forget about everything else.

What do you mean,

everything else?

What the f***, Alex?

For all the wrongs we have

committed to one another.

It is the single act of kindness

that God requires of us.

You're looking

for a room, sir?

Can't do much better.

And if you can,

I dare you to find it.

I wonder,

could I ask you a question?

No harm in it.

It might sound strange.

Do I look familiar to you

at all?

Couldn't say.

All you young people look alike.

- I might have been with a girl.

- Pretty one?

Yeah.

No. If I saw you,

it didn't stick with me.

OK. A room then.

Does anything

ever happen here?

I drove all this way and when

I got here everything was wrong.

Do you know what that's like,

to drive all this way

and have it not be

what it should be?

No, I can't say as I do.

Where is it?

Where is it?

Where is it?

Come on now, get up.

I won't say it again.

Now, you can't do that.

This is not a campsite.

Fine. Just tell me where it is.

- You just get on out of here.

- I'm going.

- Just tell me where it went.

- Where what went?

The church.

There was a church here.

Couldn't have been too long ago.

The Church of

the Solid Rock Sufferer.

There's no place like that

around here. Not here.

- You've got to be...

- I've got to be nothing.

People tend to focus on

the world around them,

rather than the world

within them.

Now, you just drive on

out of here.

OK.

Alex?

What the f***?

You just leave

in the middle of the night?

For, what, a day and a half?

You don't bother calling me,

- nothing?

- Sorry.

Oh, my God. It's f***ed up

but the only reason why

I didn't call the police is

because you have been acting

so strange lately.

Do you understand

what I'm saying to you?

That it didn't faze me

that you just left like that.

- What are you doing?

- Looking.

For what?

Scarlett. Where'd you go?

Why are you acting

like you don't know me?

Hey.

What are you doing?

I can't explain it.

Why don't you give it a try?

It's an idea I had.

I was at the grocery store.

I knocked over a carton of eggs

and I saw this bloody yolk.

You were buying eggs

at two in the morning?

It got me thinking

about some peas.

You hate peas.

Well, I was looking at them.

I was looking for something.

I looked at them

and most of them are perfect.

Bright color, firm, good size.

But then I found

this rotten one in the can.

Now, if, say I was dreaming...

I know how that sounds, but

let's just say I was dreaming.

Do you really think that

my mind would take the time

to put a rotten pea in there?

I mean, think about it.

When you think about a pea,

what do you think of?

A fresh pea, right?

A normal pea. Don't you?

I really don't think about peas,

Alex.

It's not really you,

it's your subconscious.

Do you really think

the part of you that dreams

is gonna put a rotten pea

in a can?

Don't answer that. Just look.

If I was in a dream, why would

that one bad pea be in there?

I'm gonna go to bed.

Paige?

Alex?

Alex.

What's going on?

I don't know.

Are you OK?

Are you OK?

- No.

- Alex.

Talk to me.

Talk to me, please.

Tell me what's happening.

My head's not right anymore.

I'm... I'm all over the place.

Distracted. I'm...

I'm obsessed with this idea

that I don't think I exist.

I don't think you

or any of this is real.

How long have you felt this way?

I wake up and I feel like

I'm still in a dream.

If you're...

If you're dreaming all of this...

- I'm not dreaming this.

- But you just said that.

No, no. It's worse than that.

I think someone else

is dreaming this.

But, Alex, how can we be

in someone else's dream

if you're here?

If she dies in this world,

then she wakes up.

Wait. If who dies?

And if she wakes up,

then we're...

Alex, this is real.

This is real, you and me.

Nothing else matters.

Just ignore whatever's

going on out there.

Look, stay here with me.

OK, you need this.

This is your home.

I love you.

And you love me.

All you see

You don't want to see

But can't seem to avoid

When you're trying

to be right

On this trespassed life

where

You don't seem to care

And you're making the motions

to be aware

As to why you're here

Paige?

What are you doing?

I was thirsty.

What are you doing?

Getting something to eat.

- Can I ask you a question?

- Mm-hmm.

When did we meet?

That is such a silly question.

We met yesterday. I'm your wife?

I love you.

Don't be too long.

You can come out now.

We can just skip

the formalities.

I know what you want.

Scarlett.

You know me.

You know all about me.

Yeah.

I saw you at the supermarket.

You're my neighbor.

That's not what I mean.

Tell me you remember me.

No.

Why don't you remind me.

We're in love.

If you want it, just take it.

You don't have to ask me

if it's OK.

- What are you talking about?

- You came here to rape me.

I know what you want.

You can say her name

if you want to.

You want to...

call out her name?

Scarlett.

I can be Scarlett

if you want me to be Scarlett.

No. No.

No, you can't leave.

You're not going anywhere!

F***.

What is this? Who is this?

You both know who I am.

What the f*** is wrong with you

people? Why are you lying?

He's been watching me

across the street for weeks.

I think he was

trying to rape me.

What the f***

are you talking about?

Don't!

Stop!

Do you know where you are?

Do you remember this place?

You remember him? What happened?

Where is he?

Where?

My cousin, he's...

But who knows?

Maybe it was for the best.

I mean, can you imagine the

kind of life he would have had?

It was the fire pit, wasn't it?

That's where you put him.

And this is your house.

This is where you grew up.

And the fire pit,

you tell me about that.

You tell me about

when you put him in there.

Tell me. Tell me.

Tell me!

Tell me!

Tell me!

Tell me!

Do you know what this is?

Is this him?

His bones buried for years

in this exact place.

Come on, Alex.

We both know

how this is gonna end.

Can't we just skip all of this?No!

I remember.

How can that be possible?

How can I remember?

How can I remember

the dirt falling in on me?

You dropped him... Me.

Into the hole.

Until there was only my face

and my fingertips.

And then the rain came,

pellets of it. Bullet-sized.

Do you remember?

You remember, don't you?

It filled my lungs and my throat

with mud.

Even if I wasn't paralyzed,

there was no fighting

against it.

There was nothing I could do.

Look at me!

I want you to know

what happened to me.

Do you know what happened to me?

He died, of course.

First there was fear.

And in those last few seconds,

I knew I would die.

I felt my body slip away.

I saw the world darken.

I felt the weight of that mud

pressing down on me.

And my heart beat so fast

until it just collapsed.

And I left myself.

Don't you know that you're the

one that I've been waiting for

all of this time?

Now pick up the shovel.

Pick it up!

Pick up the shovel!

Go on.

Just take it.

Can't you see that

you're nothing anymore?

You're not Alex.

You're not some hooded man.

You're not the little boy

that I killed.

- Shut up.

- You don't even exist.

You're only good for one thing,

and you know it.

So just do it.

Just hit me.

What?

Just do it. Hit me.

- I deserve it.

- Shut up.

I deserve it. I want it.

- I want it, Alex.

- No.

- Hit me!

- Shut up.

No.

You know,

if you really were him...

If you really were Wayne,

I'd watch you drown 1,000 times.

Every night I would beat you

and cut you

and drag you into another hole.

And I'd watch you,

and your eyes, your wild eyes,

as earth spills in on you.

And you'd finally understand

that this is it. This is it!

And I'm the one

who's kneeling in front of you,

filling your grave

with laughter.

- Stop it.

- And I would say it again

and again and again.

A man in a hood

came and broke in

and he threw you into a hole,

- and then he raped me.

- Shut up.

It was so easy.

It was so easy and

they would all comfort me.

And they would make me feel

so much better.

And they would never know

that you could never die

- enough for me.

- Shut up!

" I know now

I must be accountable

for my unspeakable actions.

"And don't worry, just death

comes to all things.

"Flesh, blood, bone...

are all just temporal.

"Rock lasts forever.

"Which is where

my spirit will reside.

"I love you. Scarlett."

Alex.

I go hungry

Pick at the shell

Paw the bottom

Of the well

I wear

My body

I go bottom

Struggle for air

I go humming

"Like a Prayer"

I wear

My body

I wear my body

like a rotted peach

You can have it

if you handle the stink

I'm as open as a gutted pig

On the small of every back

You'll see a picture of me

Wearing my body

I go guzzle

Scrap from the bin

Take it all

On the chin

I wear

My body
