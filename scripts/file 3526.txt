FADE IN: 
 INT. HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT 
 A party is winding down. Only a FEW GUESTS remain. They all   are gathered around the piano. A YOUNG PRIEST, FATHER HARRIS,  
 plays an old standard. Everyone sings along. A WOMAN in the   group, mid-40's, conservative, really getting into the song, 
 starts giving a soulful rendition, dropping to her knees ala 
 James Brown. The song ends. Everyone cheers. Father Harris   starts another. 
 HARRIS 
 Who knows this one?... 
 (singing) 
 "WHO LET THE DOGS OUT?!" 
 They all join in. 
 A YOUNG GIRL, MEGAN, enters the room. She watches the group.  The group notices Megan and slowly stops singing.  CLOSE ON: 
 Megan. Her eyes seem vacant, almost like she is sleep walking.  
 She mutters something. 
 MEGAN 
 You're going to die. 
 The group looks confused. 
 The young girl pees on the floor. 
 CLOSE ON: 
 A WOMAN in the group, mid-40's. She is the girl's MOTHER.  The mother apologizes to her guests. 
 MOTHER 
 I'm sorry. She's been really sick.  CLOSE ON: 
 Megan. THWACK!! She is smacked on the head by a rolled   newspaper. 
 REVEAL: 
 Mom holding the newspaper. She shoves Megan's head into the   pee and rubs her nose in it as she continues to whack her   with the newspaper. 
 MOTHER 
 No! Bad girl! Bad girl! 
 DISSOLVE TO:  EXT. HELL HOUSE -- NIGHT 
Page 2/108

 The street is covered in thick fog. The only light is by a   street lamp. 
 A taxi pulls into the frame. It reads "YELLOW CAB."  A TALL, DARK FIGURE gets out of the taxi. 
 CAB DRIVER (V.O.) 
 Hey you, pay your fare. 
 The figure takes off, running into the fog.  CAB DRIVER 
 God damn priests always pull this   shit. 
 Cab drives off. 
 CUT TO:  INT. FOYER -- CONTINUOUS 
 A doorbell RINGS. It plays the THEME to "THE EXORCIST."  CLOSE ON: 
 The mother answers the door. 
 The dark figure lifts his head up, revealing that it's Father  
 McFeely. 
 FATHER MCFEELY 
 Uh... I'm Father McFeely 
 MOTHER 
 Father, come in, please. 
 Father McFeely enters. The mother closes the door behind   him. 
 MOTHER 
 I'm so glad you're here. 
 FATHER MCFEELY 
 I came as fast as I could, but at my   age the little soldier needs a lot   more thumpin before it starts pumpin.   If I tickle my ass before... 
 MOTHER 
 It's okay. I understand. 
 FATHER MCFEELY 
 How is she? 
 MOTHER 
 (sadly) 
 She's gotten worse, Father. She won't   eat, she won't talk. The child won't   even let me touch her. 
 FATHER MCFEELY 
 (reflecting) 
 Yes... Sometimes you have to give  Page 3/108
 them candy. 
 The mother gives Father McFeely an odd look.  They are interrupted by Father Harris. He extends his hand   to McFeely. 
 HARRIS 
 Father. 
 FATHER MCFEELY 
 Not unless you have a paternity test   to prove it. 
 Harris looks confused. 
 HARRIS 
 No, I was sent by the church to assist   you. My name is Father Harris. 
 They shake hands. 
 HARRIS 
 Would you like to see the girl?  FATHER MCFEELY 
 Soon. First, I must bless this house.  McFeely walks to a room and opens the door.  INT. ROOM -- CONTINUOUS 
 Small bare walls. A window in the center wall.  McFeely closes the door. He sits and opens a bible and begins  
 to read. 
 CLOSE ON: 
 The window. Flies begin to appear. 
 CLOSE ON: 
 McFeely. He wipes sweat from his brow. 
 BACK TO THE WINDOW: 
 More flies. Their BUZZING is loud. 
 McFeely, now sweating, profusely. He begins to cough.  The window is now covered with flies. The BUZZING is   deafening. 
 McFeely, coughing and gagging. 
 FATHER MCFEELY 
 Lord, please help me to release this   demon. 
 PULL BACK TO REVEAL: 
 He's on the toilet. He lets out a loud fart followed by   plopping noises. 
 FATHER MCFEELY 
 Thank you, Father. 
 A DEMONIC VOICE is heard. 
 DEMONIC VOICE (O.S.) Page 4/108

 Get out!!! You fuckin' pig!!! 
 The room door swings open. 
 McFeely tries to flush the toilet. It bubbles over with black  
 goo ala "THE AMITYVILLE HORROR." He hustles out of the   bathroom. 
 INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS  McFeely staggers out. Father Harris rushes over.  HARRIS 
 Father, are you okay? 
 FATHER MCFEELY 
 Yeah, but you might wanna light a   match before you go in there. 
 (then) 
 Did you bring my bag? 
 HARRIS 
 Yes. 
 FATHER MCFEELY 
 Then let us prepare. 
 Both priests walk up the stairs. 
 CUT TO:  INT. MEGAN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 
 McFeely and Harris enter. 
 FATHER MCFEELY 
 Remember, don't ask her too many   questions. 
 HARRIS 
 Because she will lie? 
 FATHER MCFEELY 
 No, because her breath smells like a   horse's ass. 
 Megan lays tied to the bed post of her bed. Her face is cut   up and twisted, eyes an eerie red. She's hooked up to an   I.V. with a small tube running out of her nose. It's shaped   like a CRAZY STRAW with red fluid going through it. The straw  
 leads to a cup. "SLURPIE!" Megan is wheezing, heavily. She   wears a tee-shirt that reads, "I went to Hell and all I got   was this stupid t-shirt." 
 They go to opposite sides of the room. Megan stares straight 
 ahead. 
 Father McFeely sees that next to Megan's bed are some get-  well cards, flowers, balloons, and a teddy bear. He picks up 
Page 5/108
 one get-well card: It features a cheesy, happy cartoon dog   saying: "Heard You Were Possessed By The Devil"... He flips   the card open and reads the punch line: "He Picked One Hell   Of A Nice Girl!" 
 McFeely, shivering, his breath visible, takes the metal cross  
 from his pocket and kisses it. But it's so cold in the room   that his lips instantly stick to the metal.  He struggles to pull his lips off the cross and finally   manages to painfully tear it off his face.  McFeely makes the sign of the cross to Megan.  MEGAN 
 Shove it up your ass. You worthless   piece of shit! 
 FATHER MCFEELY 
 Silence!! 
 Father McFeely tosses a mint in her mouth.  FATHER MCFEELY 
 Look, my child. We've come to help   you. 
 Harris looks at Megan. He sits down on a chair besides the   window. 
 MEGAN/DEMON 
 Your mother's in here with us, Harris.   Would you like to leave a message?   I'll see that she gets it. 
 HARRIS 
 If that's true, then you must know   my mother's name. What is it? 
 Megan keeps a sharp stare on Harris. Harris' smile turns to   an angry stare. He rises and moves to her bedside.  HARRIS 
 What is it? 
 Megan leans forward. BLANCHHHH!!! She vomits a disgusting   green bile in Harris' face. Harris wipes it off, coughing.  HARRIS 
 That's right. Blanche was my mother's   name. You are the devil. 
 Harris tosses holy water on Megan. She falls back, writhing.  FATHER MCFEELY 
 It burns! It burns! 
 CLOSE ON: 
 McFeely, holding his crotch. 
Page 6/108
 FATHER MCFEELY 
 Damn Tijuana hooker. 
 Harris and McFeely begin to pray. 
 MCFEELY/HARRIS 
 Our Father who art in Heaven... 
 MEGAN 
 Your mother sucks cock in Hell,   Harris. 
 Harris tries to ignore her. 
 FATHER MCFEELY 
 Oh shit, you gonna take that? 
 HARRIS 
 What? 
 FATHER MCFEELY 
 What she said about your mother?  Harris fires back at Megan. 
 HARRIS 
 Oh, yeah, well your mama got one leg   and does jumping jacks like this.  He puts his feet together and jumps them from side to side   as he claps his hands over his head. 
 MEGAN 
 So, your mama's so fat when she walks   by my bed, it does this. 
 Her bed bounces and bucks off the floor. 
 HARRIS 
 What about your mama? Her butt is so   big, she wipes her ass like this.  He makes an exaggerated movement of putting his hand behind   his head then brings it up high and back down over his face.  The exchange continues with the possessed girl getting the   best of Harris. 
 HARRIS 
 Enough! Begone from this child of   God. I command you by the power of   the living and the dead... 
 Megan groaning, flicking her tongue wildly at McFeely.  HARRIS 
 ...to leave the young servant so   that she may return to her... 
 McFeely responds back with the same gesture, then simulates   her giving head, then starts wildly thrusting his pelvis,   simulating sex. Megan falls back on her pillow and moans.  Harris shoots McFeely a hard look. 
Page 7/108
 McFeely stops. Harris continues. 
 HARRIS 
 In the name of the Father, the Son,   and the Holy Spirit, I cast you out.  McFeely, coughing, hardly able to catch his breath.  Megan on the bed, laughing. Smoke billowing out of her mouth. 
 Harris rushes to McFeely. 
 HARRIS 
 Father, are you alright? 
 McFeely nods yes, revealing he's smoking a joint.  FATHER MCFEELY 
 This is some good shit. 
 He offers a hit to Harris. 
 HARRIS 
 No thanks. 
 FATHER MCFEELY 
 My holy water. 
 Harris gives him the bottle. 
 McFeely takes a swig. 
 FATHER MCFEELY 
 Ahhh, that's better. 
 McFeely splashes some on Harris, playfully.  He clears his throat and starts again, taking turns splashing  
 the booze on her and taking sips from it. 
 FATHER MCFEELY 
 The power of Christ compels you!  He splashes her again, then takes a sip. 
 She roars. Lights flicker. The scary, pale "DEATH HEAD"   flashes over her again. But this time, it's picking its nose.  
 The "DEATH HEAD" realizes it's seen and quickly pulls its   finger from its nose, trying to look all scary again.  FATHER MCFEELY 
 The power of Christ compels you!  He splashes more booze on her and takes a sip. By this time, 
 Father McFeely is getting drunk. 
 FATHER MCFEELY 
 (slurring) 
 The power of Chrishht compelshh yooo.  He's stumbling around, splashing the walls.  FATHER MCFEELY 
Page 8/108
 (slurring) 
 Power of compelshh Chrishhts you, or   something... 
 Suddenly, the girl's straps break and she starts floating   up. 
 Harris watches in awe. A MAGICIAN'S ASSISTANT passes a hoop   over her. 
 FATHER MCFEELY 
 David Blaine, kiss my ass. 
 The girl continues to float up into spinning blades out of   the ceiling fan. WHACK! The blades slam into her head, sending  
 her flying back down on to the bed. 
 HARRIS 
 Father, I think you should rest.  FATHER MCFEELY 
 No, I'm fine. 
 He staggers over to the bed, kneels and starts to pray.  Harris exits the room to retrieve his medical bag. He returns  
 to find McFeely lying unconscious on the bed. Megan, sitting,  
 quiet looks at McFeely. 
 Harris rushes over to McFeely. 
 HARRIS 
 Father! 
 Harris grabs McFeely and throws him down to the ground.  McFeely's eyes open. 
 FATHER MCFEELY 
 I must have dozed off. 
 Harris, caught up in the moment, is oblivious that McFeely   is okay. He starts pounding violently on his chest.  HARRIS 
 No!!! 
 Harris knee-drops McFeely. His efforts to revive McFeely   resemble a WWF grudge match. Harris diving off of furniture, 
 slamming down on McFeely. Finally, he checks his pulse. He   thinks McFeely is dead. Harris shouts out at Megan.  HARRIS 
 Look what you've done! 
 Megan sits, quietly. 
 Harris dives on top of Megan and starts choking her.  HARRIS 
Page 9/108
 Take me! Take me! 
 NEW ANGLE: 
 McFeely sits up, still drunk and disoriented. He notices   Harris on the bed. 
 MCFEELY'S POV: 
 He sees Father Harris on his hands and knees. His robe is   hiked above his waist exposing his naked ass.  HARRIS 
 Take me! God damn you, take me! 
 McFeely, now on his feet, smiles as he moves toward Harris.  CLOSE ON: 
 Harris' face. 
 It turns to shock and horror. He looks possessed as we hear   the sound of penetration. 
 HARRIS 
 Nooooo!!!!! 
 Harris dives out the window. 
 McFeely watches as Harris tumbles down the long staircase.  Megan begins to giggle. 
 MEGAN 
 You failed, McFeely. Your weapons   are useless against me. 
 FATHER MCFEELY 
 You're mistaken my child. The Lord   has greater weapons than me. 
 McFeely picks up his bible. 
 FATHER MCFEELY 
 Hear the word of the Lord and be   humbled! 
 McFeely lifts up a crucifix. 
 FATHER MCFEELY 
 See the cross of the Lord and tremble!   If ye still not have faith, then...  McFeely reaches into his jacket and pulls out a .44 magnum.  FATHER MCFEELY 
 ...suck on this!!! 
 Megan's eyes widen. 
 BLAM!!! 
 THE SCREEN GOES BLACK. 
 SMASH CUT TO:  TITLE CARD 
 "SCARY MOVIE II" 
 CUT TO:  EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS -- DAY -- ESTABLISHING SHOT 
Page 10/108
 The campus is alive as STUDENTS make their way to class.  CLOSE ON: 
 A souped-up muscle car driving through the parking lot.  CUT TO:  INT. CAR -- CONTINUOUS 
 The driver, DWIGHT, a nerdy man between 25-30, glasses,   thinning hair line. He drives recklessly, shouting at the   people in his path as he honks his horn. 
 DWIGHT 
 Come on. Move it. 
 A GUY ON CRUTCHES walks in front of the car.  DWIGHT 
 Come on, peg legs. I ain't got all   day. 
 Dwight whizzes past, causing the man to fall.  Dwight notices a girl in a short skirt. 
 DWIGHT 
 Hey, sweetie, ever heard of a gym?   I've seen pool sticks bigger than   those thighs. 
 Dwight continues. He finds a parking space, whizzing before   another car that has been waiting to take the space.  Dwight yells at the irate motorist. 
 DWIGHT 
 Sorry, but the fastest feet win.  Dwight shuts off the engine, and opens the door before he   exits. We see a wheelchair unfold. Dwight hops in. He is   paralyzed from the waist down. His legs dangle, lifeless. On 
 his feet, a new pair of Air Jordan sneakers.  Dwight wheels around to his trunk. He pops it open and removes  
 his briefcase and a Razor scooter. He places his feet on the 
 scooter and rolls the wheelchair with his hands. Off he goes. 
 CUT TO:  EXT. CAMPUS -- LATER 
 In the middle of the campus quad, there is a distinguished   statue of Thomas Jefferson. 
 PAN DOWN TO REVEAL: 
 A black woman slave and a bunch of nappy-headed black kids.  A plaque reads: "Once you go black, you never go back"...  Sitting on the base of the statue are CINDY and SHORTY. 
Page 11/108
 CINDY 
 So, do you think you made it into   the class? 
 SHORTY 
 I don't know, but I sure hope so.  CINDY 
 You could use the grade, huh?  SHORTY 
 Nah, I need a place to stay. So how   do you like being in college?  CINDY 
 Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating.   You know being away from home, not   knowing anyone. I feel like such a   geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool   and I'm so not. 
 SHORTY 
 Aww, you ain't that bad. You just   need a little flava. First thing we   gotta do is get you some new gear.  CINDY 
 Huh? 
 SHORTY 
 Gear. You know, clothing. 
 CINDY 
 Oh. 
 SHORTY 
 Let's start with some rhythm. Sway   back and forth like this. 
 Shorty demonstrates. Cindy begins to mimic, clumsily.  SHORTY 
 Yeah, something like that. 
 (then) 
 Now, go left, right, left, right,   crossover kick... 
 Shorty demonstrates. Cindy follows. 
 CINDY 
 Left, right, left, right, crossover   kick... 
 SHORTY 
 Now you gotta learn the correct slang.  Shorty begins to demonstrate. 
 CINDY 
 Yo! That jacket is tight. 
Page 12/108
 SHORTY 
 Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn! 
 CINDY 
 Uhn! Uhn! Uhn! 
 SHORTY 
 Yeah, you feel that? Now put it all   together. 
 Cindy now completely rhythmic and soulful, executes the   combination, just as a nicely dressed YOUNG FEMALE STUDENT   passes by. 
 CINDY 
 Left... 
 POW!!! Cindy connects with the student's jaw.  CINDY 
 POW!!! 
 Another crunching blow. 
 CINDY 
 Crossover kick... 
 Cindy smashes her foot to the face of the student. The student  
 falls to the ground. 
 CINDY 
 Uhn! That jacket is tight. Now run   that shit, bitch. 
 The student nervously gives Cindy her nice leather jacket.  Cindy slaps Shorty high-five. 
 The student takes off running. 
 Cindy puts on the jacket and poses in a gangster lean.  CINDY 
 Am I cool now? 
 SHORTY 
 Almost... Look, I gotta bounce. I'll   holla at you later. 
 Cindy gives Shorty a hug. They go their separate ways.  CUT TO:  INT. MEN'S DORM -- RAY'S ROOM -- LATER 
 RAY, and his roommate, TOMMY, are getting dressed. Their   friend, BUDDY, waits impatiently. 
 BUDDY 
 Hey, man, you two boners aren't ready   yet? We're gonna miss the bus, Ray.   Coach says if our GPA drops below 2   we're off the squad. 
 RAY 
Page 13/108
 Don't worry, we'll make it. Say,   what do you guys think, tucked in or   out? 
 REVEAL: 
 Ray, naked with his dick tucked between his legs, making it   look like he has a vagina. 
 BUDDY/TOMMY 
 Out!!! 
 RAY 
 No doubt. That's what I thought.  Ray and Tommy continue to get dresses. Buddy waits.  BUDDY 
 If you two hadn't been out partying   last night, you'd be ready by now.  TOMMY 
 It was awesome, dudes. We got fucking   wasted. I had like a whole keg. Dude,   I was so shitfaced. I woke up naked   in a tub of ice. 
 RAY 
 (laughing) 
 I woke up naked, too. 
 TOMMY 
 Hey, dude, you got a tattoo. 
 RAY 
 What does it say? 
 TOMMY 
 It says, "Ray." 
 RAY 
 (checks Tommy's back) 
 Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.  TOMMY 
 Get out?! What does it say? 
 RAY 
 "Fucked me." 
 TOMMY 
 Aww. Cool. Dude. 
 They read each other's tattoos ala "Dude, Where's My Car?"  TOMMY 
 "Ray!" 
 RAY 
 "Fucked me." 
 TOMMY 
 "Ray!" 
Page 14/108
 RAY 
 "Fucked me." 
 TOMMY/RAY 
 "Ray fucked me." 
 TOMMY 
 Hey! 
 RAY 
 What? 
 Buddy gives Tommy a wedgy. 
 BUDDY 
 Wedgy moment. 
 TOMMY 
 Totally got me, fuck. 
 He tries to fix his underwear. 
 BUDDY 
 Come on, dude. We're gonna be late.  Ray grabs his stuff. He and Buddy exit. 
 RAY 
 See you later, man. 
 CUT TO:  EXT. CAMPUS -- DAY 
 Cindy passes several activity booths. She notices a YOUNG   PRETTY GIRL on the phone, obviously upset. Her name is ALEX.  ALEX 
 (into phone) 
 That's it! I don't want to be treated   like this anymore. It's over. Goodbye.   Have a nice life. 
 She hangs up the phone. Cindy approached. 
 CINDY 
 Are you okay? 
 ALEX 
 Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with   my boyfriend, that's all. 
 CINDY 
 That's always tough. How long were   you together? 
 ALEX 
 Well, we never made it official, so   I guess we were technically never   really boyfriend and girlfriend, but   I was seeing him in school. I saw   him at the mall about six months ago   and I was too nervous to introduce  
Page 15/108
 myself so I followed him to his car,   and jotted down the license plate   number. It was registered to his   mother, so I went to her house. She   was so nice. I mean, she seemed like   she would be nice 'cuz I never really   spoke to her. I just waited til she   went to work then I climbed in through   her window and borrowed her phone   book. I say borrowed because I'm   going to give it back one day. But   anyway, I called everyone in it til   I found her son. He wasn't home when   I called so I left this message how   much in love I was with him. I was,   and how I wanted to have his children.   Just really opening up, and he never   called back. I'd call and call, and   anyway, six months and two restraining   orders later I just decided I deserved   better. What about you? Do you have   a boyfriend? 
 CINDY 
 No, I haven't dated in a while. My   last boyfriend's... 
 Alex interrupts, totally uninterested in Cindy's story.  ALEX 
 Hey, look there. My friend Brenda.  CLOSE ON: 
 BRENDA is on the financial aid line, standing before the   CASHIER. 
 CASHIER 
 Okay, here's your loan check. Your   grant check. Your disability check.   And oh, a block of government cheese.  BRENDA 
 Thanks. 
 She steps out of line. We see behind her a HOMELESS MAN,a   WELFARE MOTHER with KIDS, a CRACK ADDICT, etc.  Cindy and Alex approach. 
 ALEX 
 Hey, Brenda. 
 BRENDA 
 Do I know you? 
Page 16/108

 ALEX 
 Well, actually, we've never met   officially, but I bumped into you at   the cafeteria and you were so sweet.   I said, "I'm sorry," and you said,   "Watch it, white bitch, or I'll put   my size eight in your ass." I thought   how cool. I wear a size eight, too.   Anyway, this is my best friend, Cindy.  CINDY 
 We already know each other. Hey,   Brenda. 
 BRENDA 
 Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.  CINDY 
 Actually, I just met her. This is   Alex. 
 BRENDA 
 Oh my god. Madam Elsa, my psychic,   told me I would meet somebody whose   name starts with a letter of the   alphabet today. 
 CINDY 
 Really? That's amazing.  BRENDA 
 Hey girl, that jacket is slamming.  CINDY 
 Thanks. 
 BRENDA 
 You better be careful. I heard some   girl got her ass whooped and jacket   stolen earlier today. 
 (off Cindy's look)  Hey, what class do we have next?  CINDY 
 Psychology. 
 ALEX 
 Me, too. 101? 
 BRENDA 
 In room "302" at ten o'clock?  ALEX 
 That's it. 
 BRENDA 
 Oh, this is too much. I'm gonna have  Page 17/108

 to play these numbers. Remind me to   pick up a Lotto ticket. 
 The girls take a few steps before Brenda grabs Cindy by the   arm just as they're about to pass an iron post between them.  BRENDA 
 Wait, don't split the pole. It's bad   luck. 
 Brenda walks around Cindy's side and they go on to class.  ALEX 
 You don't really believe that stuff.  Just then, TWO OTHER STUDENTS split the pole on either side   and are mowed down by a car. 
 BRENDA 
 Oh yes, girl. After my near-death   experience, I've become very  
 spiritual. I can feel my angels all   around me, Oh, look a penny... 
 Brenda picks up the penny. They walk past a fountain.  BRENDA 
 That's good luck. Wait, let me make   a wish and throw it in the fountain.  (closing her eyes) 
 I wish for a lot of money. 
 She tosses the penny into the fountain. 
 BRENDA 
 (opening her eyes) 
 Oh, look, it worked. 
 She reaches down in the fountain and grabs both hands full   of coins. 
 BRENDA 
 God is good, y'all 
 EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS -- ESTABLISHING SHOT -- A SHORT TIME   LATER 
 CUT TO:  INT. SCIENCE BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS 
 A STUDENT walks up a flight of steps through a set of swinging  
 doors. 
 He sees Dwight coming towards the doors in his wheelchair.  STUDENT 
 There you go my man. 
 DWIGHT 
 Hey, pal, I can handle a door by   myself. 
Page 18/108
 STUDENT 
 Fine. 
 The student let the doors go. They swing, smashing into   Dwight, sending him flying. ANOTHER YOUNG STUDENT rushes to   help. 
 STUDENT #2 
 Are you okay? Let me help you to the   handicapped ramp. 
 DWIGHT 
 I am not handicapped! I can use the   steps like anyone else. 
 Dwight wheels himself over to the stairs. He successfully   navigates one step then goes tumbling violently down the   rest. 
 DWIGHT 
 That's one more than last week! 
 INT. SCIENCE BUILDING - PROFESSOR OLDMAN'S OFFICE - A SHORT   TIME LATER 
 Dwight and PROFESSOR OLDMAN, 50's, distinguished, are present. 
 DWIGHT 
 I finished all the interviews. 
 PROFESSOR 
 Let me see the files. 
 DWIGHT 
 They're on top of the bookshelf.   I'll get them. 
 Dwight wheels himself over to a bookshelf. As he attempts to 
 retrieve the folder, the professor moves to assist him.  PROFESSOR 
 Let me help you. 
 DWIGHT 
 I don't need your help. I'm perfectly   capable. 
 Dwight climbs the bookshelf, reaches the top, and lifts up   the folder. Just then, the bookshelf topples over on top of   Dwight. His hand extends from the mess, holding the folder.  DWIGHT 
 Here you go, Professor. 
 PROFESSOR 
 Are these all the subjects? 
 Dwight, disheveled, glasses bent, gets back in his wheelchair  
Page 19/108
 and makes his way over to the Professor.  DWIGHT 
 Yes. The scored all over the Kiersey   Temperament Sorter just like you   asked for. 
 PROFESSOR 
 Any of them hot? 
 Dwight rolls his eyes. 
 DWIGHT 
 I also took the liberty of putting   those with near-death experiences on   top. 
 PROFESSOR 
 Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized   co-eds are a sure thing.  DWIGHT 
 (dripping with contempt)  As I am sure you are aware, Professor,   subjects who are close to death are   statistically more likely to have   the suggestibility required for   paranormal investigation, which is,   of course, why I've given them special   consideration. 
 PROFESSOR 
 Look, whatever you say, kid, but the   more they're hurtin', the more they   need a squirtin', if you know what I   mean. 
 (then, off Cindy's   picture) 
 Ooh, I like her. 
 DWIGHT 
 Cindy Campbell. Classic abandoned   personality disorder. She seems   guarded, but willing to do this.  PROFESSOR 
 Willing? I like that. 
 (then, off Ray's  
 picture) 
 And, this one? 
 DWIGHT 
 That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite   figure him out, but he seemed very  
Page 20/108
 eager and excited when we met. 
 PROFESSOR 
 What's this? 
 Professor holds up another photo of Ray. In this one, he's   got his shirt off and his thumbs hooked in his jeans' pockets. 
 DWIGHT 
 Oh, that's the picture he sent me   after our interview. 
 The Professor continues looking at the pictures and files of 
 Shorty, Ray, Brenda, and Cindy. 
 PROFESSOR 
 Car accident, gun shot, multiple   stabbings, a hook through the back...   Where did you find these kids? 
 DWIGHT 
 They are the survivors of the  
 Steveston County massacre. 
 PROFESSOR 
 Fantastic. These kids are exactly   the kind of catalyst needed to awaken   Hell House. 
 DWIGHT 
 How are we going to get them all up   there? 
 PROFESSOR 
 I'll make it part of the class. We'll   tell them they're participating in a   study on sleep disorders. 
 DWIGHT 
 And what happens when all hell breaks   loose? 
 PROFESSOR 
 We record and document it. We're   gonna make history, Dwight. The first   documented, unrefuted evidence of   life after death. The book sales   alone will be worth millions. I'll   be rich, and you my friend, will   have one hell of a thesis paper.   Now, what time is orientation? 
 DWIGHT 
 In about fifteen minutes.

 PROFESSOR 
 Remember, Dwight, not a word to   anyone. 
 CUT TO:  INT. SCIENCE BUILDING -- HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER  Buddy, Ray and a couple of other guys are horsing around.  Smiling, Buddy, flicks a guy's ear. Slaps ANOTHER'S hat.   They all take it good and naturally return the friendly abuse. 
 BUDDY 
 Whoa! Who laid one? 
 RAY 
 Whoever smelt it, dealt it. 
 Buddy hits Ray in the chest. 
 BUDDY 
 Open chest. 
 Ray returns. 
 RAY 
 Loose nuts. You better hide them.  Ray stands grabbing the guy's crotch. Everyone stops laughing. 
 RAY 
 What? You guys don't know this game?  The girls walk past, interrupting the moment.  BUDDY 
 Dude, look out. 
 Ray turns. He and Cindy collide. Her books fall to the ground.  
 Ray, not recognizing her, bends down to help her with her   things. Their eyes meet. They are both shocked to see each   other. 
 CINDY 
 I'm sorry, I should have been watching   where I... 
 RAY 
 It's okay. 
 CINDY 
 Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing   here? 
 RAY 
 It's the sequel. 
 CINDY 
 Oh, right. 
 RAY 
Page 22/108
 Listen, no need for you to worry.   All that stuff that happened before   is behind us. Let's just try to move   on. 
 CINDY 
 I am. So just do me a favor and stay   away from me. 
 Cindy storms into class. 
 Brenda pushes through the guys. She sees Ray. Their eyes   lock. 
 RAY 
 Hello Brenda. 
 BRENDA 
 Hello Ray. 
 Though guarded, we can see they still have feelings for one   another. 
 Brenda hurries into the classroom. 
 CUT TO:  INT. PROFESSOR OLDMAN'S CLASSROOM -- CONTINUOUS  The Professor addresses the class: Cindy, Alex, Brenda,   Shorty, Dwight, Ray, Buddy, and THEO. 
 PROFESSOR 
 Welcome everyone. I'm Professor   Oldman. All of you have been carefully   selected to be in this class. This   course is very unique in that each   semester my students take part in a   bona fide study for which they receive   an automatic grade of "A" upon  
 completion. This semester's study is   insomnia. All of you have some kind   of sleep disorder that we will attempt   to resolve or at least find the origin   to. 
 THEO, a striking looking woman who is drop-dead gorgeous,   with a body to match, raises her hand. 
 THEO 
 (standing) 
 Excuse me, but I don't have a sleep   disorder. 
 PROFESSOR 
 It's okay. You have a "D-cup." You're   in the right place. 
 Theo sits. 
Page 23/108
 PROFESSOR 
 My assistant, Dwight, will be passing   out directions to everyone. 
 Dwight rolls over to the desk, picks up some papers, then   rolls over to a few steps. 
 CINDY 
 Would you like me to help you pass   them back? 
 DWIGHT 
 I don't need your help. 
 Dwight tips over in the wheelchair and falls hard against   the floor. Everyone is taken aback. Crawling, Dwight passes   out the papers. Everyone reaches down to collect one from   him. 
 PROFESSOR 
 You should arrive no later than 6PM   tonight, and plan to be there until   Monday. That's it for now. I'll see   you all this evening. 
 Class ends. Everyone exits. Buddy notices Cindy has left her 
 book. He grabs it and goes after her. 
 INT. SCIENCE BUILDING -- HALL -- CONTINUOUS  Buddy catches up to Cindy. 
 BUDDY 
 Hey, you left your book back there.  CINDY 
 Thanks. I'm Cindy. 
 Buddy hands her the book. The cover reads "Dummies Guide to   the Paranormal." 
 BUDDY 
 So, I see you're really into spooks.  CINDY 
 No. I never date outside my race.  BUDDY 
 I meant you're into ghosts. 
 CINDY 
 Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about   that kind of stuff. 
 BUDDY 
 So it looks like we're going to be   spending the weekend together. 
 CINDY 
 Yeah. 
Page 24/108

 BUDDY 
 Maybe we can study together or  
 something. 
 CINDY 
 I'm sorry, Buddy. You seem really   nice, but I'm just getting over a   really bad relationship, and I'm not   ready to start dating yet. 
 Buddy looks disappointed. 
 CINDY 
 But, hey, maybe we can be friends.  BUDDY 
 (excited) 
 Sure, that would be cool. Friends.  CINDY 
 (playfully) 
 Okay. See you later, friend. 
 She turns to walk away. Buddy notices the top of her panties,  
 grabs and yanks them up. 
 BUDDY 
 Wedgy!!! 
 Cindy hears the ripping sounds and feels the burn. She turns 
 to see Buddy running away. 
 BUDDY 
 Smell you later! Ha! Ha! 
 Cindy smiles. 
 CUT TO:  EXT. COUNTRY ROAD -- DAY 
 A small car drives by. 
 CUT TO:  INT. CAR -- CONTINUOUS 
 Cindy, singing along with the radio. She sounds terrible.   The song stops. 
 RADIO (V.O.) 
 Hey, will you shut the fuck up and   let me sing?! 
 Cindy, embarrassed, stops singing. The song starts up again. 
 Cindy checks the address as she drives up.  CUT TO:  EXT. COUNTRY ROAD -- CONTINUOUS 
 Cindy's car makes it's way up a long driveway. Page 25/108

 CUT TO:  EXT. HELL HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER 
 Cindy walks up carrying luggage. 
 CLOSE ON: 
 Door. Cindy grabs the knocker. 
 REVEAL: 
 The knocker is a set of balls hanging from a bronzed male   figure on the door. She slams them hard against the door.  No answer. She bangs the knocker again. Still no answer.   She pushed against the door. It opens, slowly.  CUT TO:  INT. FOYER -- CONTINUOUS 
 Cindy enters, walking through the house. She makes herself   at home, nosing into things she shouldn't and speaking in   general to no one. 
 CINDY 
 Hello? 
 She walks over to an answering machine and hits "play."  ANSWERING MACHINE 
 No new messages. 
 CINDY 
 Anybody home? 
 She puts that down and moves a couple of pieces on a chess   board. 
 CINDY 
 Checkmate. Hello? 
 She takes a bite off a half eaten sandwich and drinks the   last of a glass of milk. 
 CINDY 
 Hello? 
 She deliberately knocks over a domino and sets off an   elaborate carefully planned layout. 
 CINDY 
 Is anybody here? 
 She digs through the cushions of a chair and pockets some   change. 
 CINDY 
 I was told there'd be somebody here.  She opens a couple of pieces of mail and reads it, then...  CINDY 
 Hello? Your test results are in.  Cindy continues walking through a swinging door and finds   HANSON, a well-dressed man, middle-aged, with a short arm   and a little hand. He's in the middle of preparing food. He  
Page 26/108
 holds a meat cleaver in his hand as he turns toward her.   Cindy is startled. 
 CINDY 
 Oh my God! I'm here with the... 
 HANSON 
 Yes, Professor Oldman's group. Forgive   me. I didn't mean to frighten you.  He puts down the cleaver, and moves his hand towards Cindy's 
 face. 
 HANSON 
 My aren't you a lovely child. 
 Hanson strokes her face. Cindy fakes a strained smile.  HANSON 
 (tapping her nose) 
 And what is your name? 
 Cindy, almost cross-eyed, watching his finger.  CINDY 
 I'm Cindy. 
 HANSON 
 (extending his hand) 
 I'm Hanson the caretaker. 
 Cindy reluctantly shakes his hand. 
 HANSON 
 I'll show you to your room. Let me   help you with that. 
 He grabs the luggage. 
 HANSON 
 Whoa, that's heavy. I better use my   strong hand. 
 He grabs the luggage with his little hand. The bag opens,   spilling all of Cindy's items over the floor.  HANSON 
 I'm so sorry. I'll get them. 
 As Hanson retrieves the items with his little hand; a   toothbrush, underwear, and other personal effects, Cindy   looks on in horror. 
 CUT TO:  INT. BASEMENT -- LATER 
 A makeshift lab as been set-up with monitors and other high   tech equipment. 
 Dwight and the Professor discuss the project. Dwight is   wearing a brand new pair of roller blades.  DWIGHT 
Page 27/108

 I have taken care of everything,   including medical supplies and blood   storage. We want to be safe.  PROFESSOR 
 Right. What about condoms?  DWIGHT 
 Professor! 
 PROFESSOR 
 Hey, you're the one who brought up   safety. I'm perfectly willing to go   in raw. 
 DWIGHT 
 Would you please focus? 
 PROFESSOR 
 Fine. 
 (then) 
 What's all this stuff? 
 DWIGHT 
 Well, this measures the amount of   thermal imbalance within a room down   to the tiniest molecular disturbances.  The Professor is distracted by a bank of monitors.  PROFESSOR 
 Are those cameras all throughout the   house? 
 DWIGHT 
 Yes, I thought that it would be best.  PROFESSOR 
 Even in the bathroom? 
 Dwight gestures to a monitor. 
 PROFESSOR 
 So, if one of our little chickadees   is taking a shower which one of these   buttons do I press to get a close-  up? 
 DWIGHT 
 (annoyed) 
 That one. 
 PROFESSOR 
 After dinner, you and I will take   shifts throughout the night. I don't   want to chance miss anything.  HANSON 
 Excuse me, sir, but the students  Page 28/108
 have started to arrive. Dinner will   be ready shortly. 
 DWIGHT 
 Thanks, handyman. 
 HANSON 
 I'm the caretaker, not the handyman.  (off Dwight's footwear) 
 Nice skates. Be careful. You don't   want to fall and break something.  Hanson exits before Dwight can respond. 
 PROFESSOR 
 I'm going to change for dinner.   I'll see you shortly. 
 DWIGHT 
 Sounds good. I'm just going to run   up to my room. Hop in the shower.   Jump into my jogging suit, and I'll   be right there. 
 The Professor exits. 
 CUT TO:  INT. DINING ROOM -- NIGHT 
 Cindy enters. Ray, Shorty, Professor, Dwight, Alex, Brenda   and Buddy are all already gathered. 
 CINDY 
 (excitedly) 
 Hi guys. 
 GROUP 
 (barely noticing Cindy) 
 Hey. What's Up? Uh huh. 
 Theo enters the room. Everyone stares. 
 THEO 
 Hey guys! 
 GROUP 
 (excited) 
 Hi Theo! 
 Buddy approaches Cindy. 
 CINDY 
 (smiling) 
 Hi Buddy. 
 BUDDY 
 Open chest!!! 
 Buddy punches her in the chest. Cindy goes flying.  BUDDY 
 Gotta be quicker than that, "A-cup!" Page 29/108
 Cindy staggers to her feet. 
 THEO 
 Well, are you boys just gonna stand   there with your mouths open, or is   somebody gonna offer me a seat?  Cindy sits just as Buddy unknowingly grabs the chair from   under her to give to Theo. 
 Cindy crashes to the floor. 
 THEO 
 Many chairs are pushed in front of her including Dwight's   wheelchair. 
 REVEAL: 
 Dwight sitting on Ray's lap. 
 DWIGHT 
 (referring to his  
 wheelchair) 
 It's the best seat in the house. I   warmed it up for you. 
 RAY 
 Second best. 
 Theo sits next to the Professor. 
 Cindy and Dwight reseat themselves. 
 CINDY 
 Professor, is this the same house   that a young girl was possessed by a   demon or something? 
 PROFESSOR 
 Yes, it was reported, but never   substantiated. 
 SHORTY 
 Yeah, just like that charges regarding   me and that blind Haitian girl.  BRENDA 
 Pass me the salt. 
 Brenda tosses a handful of salt over her shoulder. It goes   into Dwight's face. 
 DWIGHT 
 Hey, what are you doing? 
 BRENDA 
 Keepin' evil spirits away. And if   that don't work I always got this.  Brenda pulls out a gun and cocks it. 
 PROFESSOR 
 Not to worry. There's been no reported  Page 30/108

 activity in the house for over twenty   years. 
 DWIGHT 
 Let's not forget, folks, this is a   study on sleep disorders. 
 PROFESSOR 
 Ah, yes, which reminds me, who here   thinks they'd wake up if somebody   snuck into their room and started   sniffing between their legs? 
 Hanson rolls in a cart filled with a variety of food,   including a huge turkey. 
 BUDDY 
 Enough spooky stuff. Let's eat.  BRENDA 
 Well ain't we gonna bless this food   first? 
 ALEX 
 Allow me... God is good, God is great,   but not all the time. Sometimes he   could be a real asshole, because it   seems as though every time I try to   establish a relationship with him,   he never returns my calls. I've been   praying for twenty-four years and I   haven't heard his voice yet. Not one   message on my answering machine.   Your miracles don't impress me. It's   your quality time I want. So, if you   hear me, and I know you're up there,   thanks for the food. It's the least   you can do. In Jesus' name, don't   let me get started on him, Amen.  Alex looks up to see everyone staring in awe.  HANSON 
 Anyone care for appetizers? 
 Everyone chimes in their request. 
 Hanson removes the long napkin draped over his arm, revealing  
 his short arm and little hand with its stubby fingers. He   uses this hand to hold the tray of appetizers. He offers   some to the Professor. 
 HANSON 
 Finger food? 
Page 31/108
 Hanson walks around the table with the tray, offering.   Everybody reaches to take one. They realize that the   appetizers look creepily like Hanson's fingers. Cindy breaks 
 the tension and reaches for a roll. 
 CINDY 
 How about these buns? 
 RAY 
 Yeah, they're so warm and soft. 
 BUDDY 
 Ray!!! 
 Ray pulls his finger from Buddy's ass. POP!  RAY 
 Oh, my bad. 
 HANSON 
 Sure, I'll just set them down and   you can help yourself. 
 Everyone grabs a roll. Cindy takes a big bite.  CINDY 
 Ummm!! They smell delicious. 
 HANSON 
 Thanks. I made them by hand. 
 Everyone drops their rolls. Cindy spits a mouthful into her   napkin. 
 HANSON 
 The potatoes are just about ready.   Let me just go whip them up real   good. 
 He whips the potatoes. His knuckles dip into the bowl,   covering them with potatoes. Hanson licks his knuckles.  HANSON 
 Ah, that's good. Dig in. 
 Hanson places the bowl on the table. 
 HANSON 
 And now for the turkey. 
 RAY 
 Say, what do you say you let me do   that? You just relax. You've done   enough. 
 HANSON 
 Oh, nonsense. It's my pleasure. 
 Hanson raises a large knife, then rests his little hand on   the turkey to hold it steady. 
 HANSON 
Page 32/108
 You know, making a turkey is a real   art. The trick is in the stuffing. A   lot of people are afraid to get their   hands dirty. Not me. When I stuff   it, I like to get the whole hand up   in there. And you know I use a secret   ingredient in the stuffing... 
 Hanson pulls out a box of "HAMBURGER HELPLESS" with a crippled  
 white glove on the box. 
 Everyone moans. Their appetites, ruined as Hanson continues   to tear up the turkey. 
 HANSON 
 Who's first? Anyone like a wing?  DWIGHT 
 Yours, or the turkeys? 
 HANSON 
 I supposed you'd like a leg. How   about two? 
 DWIGHT 
 That's it. I'm gonna put my food in   your ass. I should warn you, I'm a   black belt in karate. 
 Dwight pulls out a picture of himself in karate outfit lying 
 on the floor with one leg up in a pose. 
 HANSON 
 You don't scare me. I was a Golden   Gloves champion. 
 Hanson pulls out his own picture of himself, shirtless in a   boxing pose with a regular glove and a miniature glove on   his little hand. 
 PROFESSOR 
 Relax, Dwight. 
 (then) 
 I got an idea. 
 (to Hanson) 
 Is there anything you didn't make?  HANSON 
 Well, the dessert. I ordered out.  PROFESSOR 
 Great. What do you say we just skip   the heavy stuff and go straight to   the dessert? 
Page 33/108
 HANSON 
 Well, I guess if that's what you all   wish. 
 Hanson goes to retrieve the dessert. He returns with a large 
 cream pie. 
 Everyone smiles. Hanson cuts a piece, slowly. Everyone watches  
 to see if he'll put his hands in it. He doesn't.  Hanson places the pie on Cindy's plate. 
 Cindy smiles. She's about to take a bite when Buddy sticks   his finger in the pie. 
 BUDDY 
 My germs! 
 He takes the pie from Cindy, but before he can take a bite   Dwight sticks his finger in the pie. 
 DWIGHT 
 My germs! Ha, ha! 
 Everyone laughs. 
 The professor reaches to cut himself a piece of pie when...  Hanson shoves his finger in the pie. 
 HANSON 
 My germs! Ha, ha! 
 Everyone tosses down their napkins and gets up from the table. 
 HANSON 
 (licking his fingers) 
 Funny, I always win that game. 
 DISSOLVE TO:  INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT 
 Everyone gathers around the fireplace, enjoying after dinner 
 beverages. 
 THEO 
 She stands behind the bar, mixing drinks for the guys.  THEO 
 What can I get for you, boys? 
 SHORTY 
 Yo, I'll take a "Sex on the Beach."  THEO 
 Professor? 
 PROFESSOR 
 Make mine a "Screaming Orgasm." 
 THEO 
Page 34/108
 Ray, what do you want? 
 RAY 
 Balls on My Chin... 
 (off their reactions) 
 What, you out of "Bacardi?" Fine,   give me a "Mud Slide." 
 Theo gets behind the bar and begins to entertain everyone   with a nice display of bottle tossing. She is flipping bottles  
 of alcohol behind her back, under her arms, between her legs.  
 She then jumps on top of the bar and lays on her back and   starts spinning the bottles on her big tits!  CINDY 
 Professor, what's the history of   this house? 
 PROFESSOR 
 I'm glad you asked. It actually makes   for a pretty good bedtime story.  The Professor picks up a children's book. "This Old Haunted   House." He sits in front of the fireplace.  PROFESSOR 
 Gather around. 
 Everyone gathers around the fireplace. 
 PROFESSOR 
 This house was built in 1898 by a   man named Archibald Keaton as a gift   to his wife, Cora. 
 BRENDA 
 Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora...   Keaton... I am here to communicate...  PROFESSOR 
 No, they sold the house in 1920 to a   millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth. 
 BRENDA 
 Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his   evil presence. 
 PROFESSOR 
 No, he lost the house after the stock   market crash. 
 BRENDA 
 But he could still be haunting the   house. He's angry that he had to   leave. 
Page 35/108
 PROFESSOR 
 He's not dead, you idiot. He lives   in Florida. Now, shut up and let me   finish. 
 Brenda, sheepishly, sits down. NEW ANGLE: 
 GHOST'S POV of the group. 
 It moves slowly towards them. 
 PROFESSOR 
 Anyway, the last owner was a very   rich man who built his empire off   the blood and sweat of the people in   this town. He lived like a king until   one day the servants of the house   killed him. 
 A log in the fireplace snaps, startling everyone.  BRENDA 
 I think there's more to the story.   I can feel something evil in the   house. It's all around. In the wall,   the floor, this piano... 
 She strums the wire keys. One snaps and smacks her in the   head. 
 BRENDA 
 Ouch!! 
 CINDY 
 Brenda, are you okay? Come sit. 
 BRENDA 
 No, you don't understand. It's here   in these statues... 
 She touches two statues, holding lights. They smash her in   the head. She staggers over to a Cuckoo clock.  BRENDA 
 This clock... 
 The clock strikes twelve. The bird shoots out and pecks her   in the face. She falls into a mirror. 
 BRENDA 
 This mirror... 
 Her own reflection punches her in the face.  Brenda sails against the wall. She sees a collection of swords  
 and knives displayed on the wall. 
 BRENDA 
 These... 
 The knives start to rumble. 
Page 36/108

 GROUP 
 NO!!! 
 BRENDA 
 You're right. Not in the knives.  She turns to see on the adjacent wall, antique guns.  BRENDA 
 It's in the guns. 
 BLAM! The gun fires. Brenda goes down. 
 DWIGHT 
 My God! Is she dead? 
 PROFESSOR 
 No, they're just powder burns, thank   God. They were empty. Get her  
 upstairs. 
 ALEX 
 Maybe this house is possessed. 
 PROFESSOR 
 No such thing. What you all witnessed   was psychosomatic, purely self-induced   reactions brought on by hysteria.   Now I want everyone to get some rest.   We will start our testing in the   morning. 
 CUT TO:  EXT. HELL HOUSE -- NIGHT 
 The wind howls. Doors and windows rattle. A full moon shines 
 overhead. 
 CUT TO:  INT. LAB -- NIGHT 
 The Professor speaks into a tape recorder.  PROFESSOR 
 The group responded beyond  
 expectation. Cindy and Brenda seemed   most susceptible to the suggestion   of horror. Brenda exhibiting both   delusion and hysteria. Group fear   should manifest itself and intensify   as the night progresses. 
 Dwight is reviewing the video tapes from earlier. He notices 
 an image on the tape. 
 DWIGHT 
 Professor, I think you should see  Page 37/108

 this. 
 PROFESSOR 
 What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot?   What? 
 DWIGHT 
 No, these are the tapes from the   living room. Check this out. 
 Dwight rewinds the tape. We see Brenda being attacked.  DWIGHT 
 The image there. 
 PROFESSOR 
 Are you sure it's not the tape? 
 DWIGHT 
 I don't think so. It's on all the   cameras, and check this out. The   thermal readings inside the house   dropped ten degrees when the image   was recorded. 
 PROFESSOR 
 Congratulations, Dwight, it's begun.  CUT TO:  INT. LIVING ROOM -- LATER 
 Cindy walks past a bird cage. She notices the little bird is 
 dead. 
 CINDY 
 Oh no, little bird. 
 Cindy gently removes the bird from his cage.  CUT TO:  INT. BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS 
 Cindy enters, lifts up the toilet seat, and is about to flush  
 the little bird when Shorty walks in holding a cigar box.  SHORTY 
 Oh, my bad. 
 He notices the bird. 
 SHORTY 
 Aww, the little bird died. 
 CINDY 
 Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.  SHORTY 
 (looking at the cigar  
 box) 
 Hey, I got an idea. 
Page 38/108
 CUT TO:  INT. KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER 
 CLOSE ON: 
 Open cigar box. 
 We see little bones being tossed into the box.  PULL BACK TO REVEAL: 
 Cindy and Shorty eating the fried bird. 
 CINDY 
 That was a great idea, Shorty. 
 SHORTY 
 I told you it would taste just like   chicken. 
 Cindy and Shorty finish eating, and toss the final bones in   the box. Cindy closes the box, She notices something strange 
 in the kitchen. 
 NEW ANGLE: 
 All the cabinet doors are open and the chairs are stacked on 
 the table. 
 CINDY 
 (to Shorty) 
 Did you do that? 
 SHORTY 
 Uh, uh. 
 CINDY 
 You better go get Dwight and the   Professor. 
 Shorty exits. 
 CUT TO:  INT. KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER 
 Shorty returns with the Professor and Dwight.  Cindy finishes drawing something on the floor.  PROFESSOR 
 Alright, Cindy, what's so important?  CINDY 
 Professor, you guys gotta see this.   Dwight, come here. 
 Cindy grabs Dwight's chair, places him in a circle on the   floor. In front of the circle are arrows pointing to the   wall. 
 DWIGHT 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 CINDY 
Page 39/108
 Just wait, you'll see. 
 A BEAT 
 Dwight's chair moves by itself, slamming Dwight head first   into the wall. 
 CINDY 
 (excited) 
 Yippie! Wasn't that amazing? 
 PROFESSOR 
 It's some kind of energy field. We   better record this. 
 CINDY 
 Got my camera right here. 
 Professor grabs Dwight's chair. Dwight is still dazed as he   is placed back in the circle. Again, his chair flies forward,  
 slamming him into the wall. 
 CINDY 
 I got it! 
 PROFESSOR 
 That's fantastic. Our first  
 phenomenon. This is going to be a   great weekend. You guys better get   some sleep. Dwight and I will take   over from here. 
 CUT TO:  INT. DARK HALLWAY -- LATER 
 GHOST POV: 
 It moves through the hallway to Theo's room.  INT. THEO'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS 
 Ghost CAM finds Theo sitting at the vanity table removing   her makeup. 
 Theo senses something. She looks around. 
 THEO 
 Hello, hello? 
 She shrugs and continues to remove her make-up.  Theo notices a pimple. 
 THEO 
 Damn. 
 SPLAT!!! Goo hits the mirror as she pops the pimple.  GHOST'S REACTION. 
 Theo reaches for a brush. As she looks down the mirror is   tipped-up by the ghost. She doesn't notice.  Theo looks up and notices something else. There's a booger   in her nose. 
Page 40/108
 THEO 
 Oh, my. How long has that been there?  She picks her nose and flicks the booger. 
 The booger lands on the ghost. We see it shaking wildly as   the ghost tries to get it off. 
 Theo lifts her foot up and cracks her toes. She examines her 
 feet. 
 THEO 
 Oh, I need a pedicure. 
 She looks on the table for something. 
 THEO 
 Shit, forgot my clippers. Aw, fuck   it. 
 She raises her foot to her mouth and bites her toenail.  GHOST (V.O.) 
 Ugh. 
 THEO 
 Huh? Who said that? 
 Theo gets up and locks her door. 
 Not knowing the ghost is behind her, she turns and faces   him. 
 GHOST POV: 
 Theo unhooks her bra. 
 CLOSE ON: 
 The bra. As it hits the floor we see two false breasts fall   out. 
 REVEAL: 
 Theo's real breasts are saggy. 
 Theo scratches her breasts under, on top, and around the   nipples until she's satisfied. 
 THEO 
 Ahhh, that's better. 
 She walks past the ghost still scratching, this time under   her arm. 
 THEO 
 Whew, not fresh are we? 
 By now, the ghost is ready to give up. From his POV we see   he doesn't follow Theo. 
 Theo bends over to get something out of her bag.  GHOST POV: 
 Theo's perfect ass. 
 He makes his move. 
 The Ghost CAMERA moves in on Theo's ass. 
Page 41/108
 Just as he's about to attack, Theo farts, loudly, releasing   a translucent green gas that makes the ghost sickened face   visible for an instant. 
 The Ghost, waving in front of his nose. 
 THEO 
 Whew. I was holding that one in all   day. 
 She stands and turns. We see she's holding a box of tampons.  That's it. The ghost takes off running, slamming the door   behind him. 
 CUT TO:  INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT 
 Cindy is walking to her bedroom. 
 Suddenly, she hears someone whispering her name.  VOICE 
 Cindy... Cindy Cindy. 
 She stops and listens. 
 VOICE 
 Cindy... Cindy... 
 CINDY 
 Who is it? Who are you? 
 VOICE 
 Help us Cindy. Help us. 
 CINDY 
 Help you how? 
 VOICE 
 Check the music room. 
 The voice disappears. 
 CINDY 
 Where are you? 
 NEW ANGLE: 
 Buddy, walking down the hallway, tossing a football in the   air, sees Cindy. 
 BUDDY 
 Hey Cindy. 
 She turns. 
 BUDDY 
 Think fast. 
 Buddy fires the football. 
 BONK!!! The ball beans Cindy right in the head. She goes   down. 
 Buddy approaches. 
 BUDDY 
 Dude, you suck. 
Page 42/108
 Cindy staggers to her feet. 
 CINDY 
 You know, Buddy, about this friendship   thing... 
 BUDDY 
 Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think   it's so cool... have a girl as a   friend. 
 CINDY 
 That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl.   You can't be so rough with me.  BUDDY 
 Then what kinda stuff can we do?  CINDY 
 Gentle stuff like talking, sharing   thoughts and ideas, secrets and past   experiences. Stuff like that, you   know. 
 BUDDY 
 It sounds gay, but guess since you're   a girl it's okay, huh? 
 CINDY 
 Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check   something out. Will you come with   me? 
 BUDDY 
 (sweetly) 
 Sure. We can practice talking.  CINDY 
 (smiling) 
 Okay. 
 INT. MUSIC ROOM -- SHORT TIME LATER 
 Cindy and Buddy enter. Buddy's in the middle of a story.  BUDDY 
 So, this hot Spanish chick is licking   my balls and I'm fingerbanging her,   right, just then... 
 Cindy, annoyed. 
 CINDY 
 Buddy... 
 BUDDY 
 Wait, I'm just about to tell you the   best part. 
 Cindy notices something on the floor. 
Page 43/108
 CINDY 
 Oh my God. Look. 
 Bloodied footprints. 
 BUDDY 
 Dude, somebody's on the rag. 
 CINDY 
 Shhh! 
 Buddy and Cindy follow the footsteps. 
 They lead to a secret passage. 
 Cindy opens it to REVEAL a secret room. 
 CUT TO:  INT. SECRET STUDY -- CONTINUOUS 
 It's an old, dark creepy study. Shelves of dust covered with 
 books, several paintings on the wall, an old wooden desk.  CINDY 
 It must be a private study, or  
 something. 
 Cindy finds an old newspaper. 
 Headline: "Servants Kill Hugh Kane." There's a picture of   HUGH KANE and an article on the killing. 
 CINDY 
 There's more to the story of this   house than the Professor told us. It   says here that Hugh Kane had a wife   who died mysteriously a week before   the servants killed him. 
 Buddy looks at the painting on the wall. He wipes away the   dust exposing the face. 
 The painting is of a woman. It looks like Cindy. She's wearing  
 a pendant around her neck. 
 BUDDY 
 Whoa, check this out. She looks like   you. 
 CINDY 
 Wow, she's beautiful. You really   think she looks like me? 
 BUDDY 
 Her hair doesn't have as many split   ends at yours. Her skin isn't as   oily as yours, either. Also, sometimes   your eyes get kinda squinty and they   look like you might have Down's  
Page 44/108
 Syndrome or something. Otherwise the   resemblance is uncanny. 
 Cindy is feeling terrible about herself now. For a moment we 
 think the criticism is done. 
 BUDDY 
 Oh yeah... another difference is she   looks more sophisticated and classy.   More feminine. And her tits are   perfect. Not pointy and funny looking,   or spaced too far apart... 
 CINDY 
 (annoyed) 
 Alright! 
 Cindy finds a small chest, ornately decorated. The name   "Carolyn" inscribed on it. 
 CINDY 
 Buddy, look at this. I think it   belonged to her. 
 Suddenly, a loud noise. 
 Cindy and Buddy nearly jump out of their skin.  REVEAL: 
 A BLACK CAT. 
 BUDDY 
 Come on, let's get out of here.   This place is giving me the creeps.  Cindy grabs the chest and they exit. 
 INT. BRENDA'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 
 The room is dark. The only light is the moonlight. Brenda   stirs in bed. Ray is next to her. 
 RAY 
 Shhh... It's okay. 
 BRENDA 
 Ray, have you been here all this   time? 
 RAY 
 I just wanted to make sure you were   okay. 
 BRENDA 
 I'm fine. Just a few bruises. 
 RAY 
 So, I guess I can go now. 
 BRENDA 
 No, stay. 
Page 45/108

 RAY 
 You sure? 
 BRENDA 
 Yeah, I think I'll feel better  
 sleeping in the arms of a strong   man. 
 RAY 
 Yeah, me too. 
 Brenda gives a confused look. 
 BRENDA 
 I'm gonna take a shower. I'll be   right back. 
 Brenda exits. 
 Ray sits on the bed for a moment. He notices a clown doll   sitting in a rocking chair across the room. The moonlight   gives the clown face an eerie glow. 
 Ray takes off his shirt and tosses it at the clown, covering 
 its face an causing the chair to rock. 
 Ray gets down and does a few push-ups. 
 CLOSE ON: 
 The door. A fog-like mist comes into the room. Ray feels a   chill and checks the thermostat. 
 RAY 
 Damn, it's cold. 
 Ray goes to retrieve his shirt. He notices the clown is gone. 
 Ray looks around and doesn't see the clown doll anywhere.  Suddenly, a rustling noise comes from under the bed.  Ray's breathing, quickens. He knows where he must now look.  
 Ray slowly lowers himself head first to the floor of the   bed, in preparation to look under it. 
 He very, very carefully lifts the dust ruffle and lets the   top of his head touch the rug. Ray is upside-down as he looks  
 into the darkness under his bed. 
 Under the bed. The clown is there, face to face with him,   smiling sardonically. 
 In the split-second it takes for a child to draw a breath   and let it out through the vocal chords, the clown wraps its 
 five foot extension arms around Ray's neck, cutting off half Page 46/108

 his air. 
 WIDE ANGLE HIGH. 
 Struggling now for his life, Ray is dragged helplessly under 
 the bed and out of sight. Under the bed we hear a struggle,   followed by the evil laugh of the clown. 
 CLOWN DOLL (V.O.) 
 Hee! Hee! Hee! Hee! 
 RAY (V.O.) 
 Oh, you want to play! 
 We hear more struggling. 
 CLOWN DOLL (V.O.) 
 Hey, stop that? Homey don't play   that. 
 The clown attempts to climb from under the bed, only to be   dragged back under by Ray. Now we hear Ray laughing,   maniacally. 
 RAY (V.O.) 
 Hee! Hee! Hee! Hee! 
 CLOWN DOLL (V.O.) 
 No! No! Noooooo!!! 
 INT. BRENDA'S BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 
 Brenda enters to find Ray out of breath, and buckling his   pants. 
 BRENDA 
 Are you okay? I thought I heard   screaming. 
 RAY 
 Oh, I'm fine... just clowning around.  ANGLE ON: 
 The clown doll. His pants are down by his ankles. His head   turns to the camera. His smile is gone, replaced by a frown. 
 A single tear is running down his face. 
 INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 
 The window blows open. Curtains flutter in the wind.  Alex sleeping. Her head back, her mouth open. She snores,   lightly, unaware of the presence in the room. A breeze brushes  
 past her causing her hair to move. Alex remains asleep.  CLOSE ON: 
 ALEX 
 The ghost pulls up her t-shirt to reveal a pair of perfect   breasts. 
Page 47/108

 Her breasts get squeezed at the base, and bulge out like   water balloons, but she still doesn't wake up.  The GHOST continues kissing her neck. 
 Alex moans, still sleeping. 
 CLOSE ON: 
 ALEX'S FACE 
 Her mouth opens wider. We see a growing indentation in her   cheek as if something is going in and out of her mouth.  Suddenly, Alex's eyes open. She sits up and tries to speak.  ALEX 
 Mmph! Mmph! 
 The back of her head stretches to the shape of a penis.  Alex struggles with the force, finally breaking free.  ALEX 
 Somebody help! Help! 
 The ghost pins her to the bed and attacks her. Throwing her   arms over her head, Alex screams. 
 ALEX 
 (startled) 
 Ah! 
 Then throwing her legs behind her head, she screams again.  ALEX 
 Oh! Okay. 
 The ghost starts fucking Alex. He's very rough and dominate.  ALEX 
 (intrigued) 
 Oh, my God. Yes! Yes! 
 The ghost drags her up the wall and over a portrait of a   solemn looking man. 
 Then Alex's butt slides over his face and the man is now   smiling. 
 The ghost drags her across the ceiling and crashes her head   into the light fixture. 
 The sexual Olympics continue as she spider-walks down the   wall and is dragged across the floor, smoke comes up from   beneath her. 
 ALEX 
 Oooh. Oooh. Rug burn. Rug burn. 
 The ghost gets Alex back to the bed and flips her over to   reveal tire skid marks down her back. 
 Still the sexcapades continue. 
 CUT TO:  EXT. HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 
 The bedroom window is totally fogged over when Alex's hand  Page 48/108
 hits it and slides down the glass ala TITANIC.  CUT TO:  INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS 
 Suddenly, it stops as quickly as it begun.  Alex lays disheveled on the bed. 
 ALEX 
 (desperate) 
 Call me. 
 The door slams. 
 Alex lights a cigarette. 
 INT. CINDY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 
 Cindy, sitting in bed, trying to open the chest. She is   startled by the sound of the door creaking open.  CINDY 
 (nervous) 
 Who's there? 
 The black cat enters. Cindy gives a sigh of relief.  CINDY 
 Hey, kitty, kitty. How you doin'   girl? 
 The cat pauses and gives her the finger by flicking his claw 
 out with the gesture. 
 CINDY 
 Huh? 
 Suddenly, the cat attacks grabbing and scratching her throat. 
 Cindy tosses the cat off and jumps to her feet.  The cat lands and pounces right back. 
 Cindy catches it and throws it down harder, sending it   crashing into a table which smashes into pieces.  Cindy and the cat circle each other. 
 The cat grabs a bottle from the table, breaks it, holding   the jagged side out towards Cindy. 
 The cat jumps on Cindy, knocks her to the floor, pinning her 
 down. The cat tries to shove the broken bottle into Cindy's   face. 
 Cindy, desperately, holds back the cat's paw. Her teeth   gritting with effort. 
 Cindy slowly turns the bottle towards the cat, who now looks 
 worried. 
 Cindy makes her move, flipping the cat over. Now, she's on  Page 49/108

 top pushing the bottle close to the cat's throat.  The cat gives a huge effort and shoves Cindy off of itself.  Fighting dirty, the cat reaches into its litter box and throws  
 some of the sand in Cindy's eyes. The cat then picks up a   chair and breaks it over Cindy's head, then jumps on her   back and tries to strangle her with piano wire. But Cindy   manages to flip the cat forward over her shoulder.  Cindy runs into the bathroom and locks herself inside.  CUT TO:  INT. CINDY'S BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS 
 Kitty's paws reach for her from beneath the door.  REVEAL: 
 His eye peeking through the keyhole. 
 Suddenly, an ax chops through the door making a big enough   hole for the kitty to reach in and turn the knob.  CINDY 
 (screaming) 
 Somebody help me! 
 Cindy is desperate. She looks for anything that might save   her. Cindy grabs a ball of yarn. 
 CINDY 
 Here, kitty, kitty. Look... 
 Cindy plays with the yarn. 
 The cat can't resist. He wants the yarn. 
 CINDY 
 Go get it. 
 Cindy tosses the ball of yarn, it flies out the window. The   cat leaps after it, falling to its death. 
 CUT TO:  INT. CINDY'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS 
 Cindy staggers out of the bathroom, bloodied clothes torn.  Theo rushes to her. 
 THEO 
 Are you okay? 
 CINDY 
 I think so. 
 THEO 
 Come on. We better get you cleaned   up. 
 CUT TO:  INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT -- SHORT TIME LATER 
 Theo tends to Cindy's wounds. The professor pours a cup of   tea. 
Page 50/108

 CINDY 
 I'm telling you, it was possessed.  PROFESSOR 
 Theo, did you see the animal? 
 THEO 
 No, I just heard the commotion, and   when I got there I guess it was gone.  CINDY 
 What, you think I did this to myself?  PROFESSOR 
 No, I'm just saying cats are known   to be very territorial animals, and   it is likely it did attack, but it   doesn't mean it was possessed. Maybe   the two of you should sleep together.  CINDY 
 What are you getting at, Professor?  PROFESSOR 
 Only that if this cat did attack,   he's less likely to come back if the   two of you were, let's say, together.   Come on, it's college. Time for you   two to experiment. 
 THEO 
 Cindy, I don't think we're going to   get any help here. 
 PROFESSOR 
 Actually, I'd be more than willing   to walk you through it. 
 THEO 
 Come, Cin, I'll make sure you're   tucked in. 
 Theo and Cindy rise to exit. 
 PROFESSOR 
 Good idea, and don't forget to give   her a good-night kiss. 
 CINDY 
 There's something going on in this   house. I'm not crazy. 
 CUT TO:  INT. CINDY'S BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 
 Cindy enters and says good-night to Theo. 
 THEO 
 Good-night, Cin. I'll be next door  Page 51/108

 if you need me. 
 CINDY 
 Thanks, I'll be fine. 
 Cindy closes the door and walks to her bed. She notices a   picture has fallen off the night stand. 
 Cindy places it back on the nightstand. 
 Cindy turns to climb into bed when she hears the picture   fall again. This time the frame breaks, revealing a key hidden  
 in the frame. 
 Cindy examines the key. She gets an idea. 
 Cindy retrieves the chest she found in the secret study form 
 beneath her bed. She places the key in the hole and turns   it. 
 The chest opens. 
 Cindy finds several items. 
 Pictures of Carolyn. 
 A diary. 
 An old fashioned dildo. 
 The pendant worn by Carolyn in the photos.  Cindy walks to the mirror, slowly placing the pendant around 
 her neck. She looks up into the mirror. Her eyes have a   strange look. She slowly turns and looks at the bedroom door. 
 DISSOLVE TO:  INT. KITCHEN -- LATER THAT NIGHT 
 The refrigerator door opens. We see the Professor looking   for a snack. He grabs an apple. 
 REVEAL: 
 Cindy wearing a sexy red dress ala "Michelle Pfeiffer."  CINDY 
 Hello, Professor. 
 He smiles. 
 PROFESSOR 
 Hello, Cindy... 
 She shakes her head. 
 CINDY 
 Forbidden fruit. 
 She takes the apple. 
 CINDY 
 Got a problem with that? 
 PROFESSOR 
Page 52/108
 Yeah, bitch, give me my apple. What's   gotten into you? 
 He snatches the apple back. 
 Cindy walks over to a basket of fruit on the counter and   picks up a banana. 
 Provocatively, she peels it and, looking deep in his eyes,   she slips the banana into her mouth, sliding it in and out   simulating a blow job. Suddenly, the banana breaks off in   her throat and she starts to choke on it. She turns red,   gagging and coughing. 
 CINDY 
 Gock -- gock -- gock... 
 Finally, realizing that something is wrong, the Professor   runs over to her and does the Heimlich on her. She finally   spits up a big chunk of banana and it plops on the floor.  Recovering, she sits back down on the stairs, continuing her 
 seduction. She picks up a whole pineapple and starts licking  it sexually and finally shoves the whole thing in her mouth, 
 again simulating a blow job. 
 ANGLE ON: 
 THE PROFESSOR 
 He's getting back in the mood, getting turned on again.  PROFESSOR 
 Ooo, yes. 
 ANGLE ON: 
 CINDY 
 She drops the pineapple and picks up a watermelon, shoving   that in her mouth -- stretching out her mouth and face,   insanely. She slides it in and out of her mouth.  ANGLE ON: 
 THE PROFESSOR 
 PROFESSOR 
 Ohh... mmm... 
 Satisfied that the Professor is well turned on, Cindy drops   the watermelon. She then grabs a lit candle and struts to   the kitchen steps where she sits and places the candle between  
 her legs. 
 The Professor watches, seductively. 
 Cindy spreads her legs, lifts the front of her dress. A strong  
Page 53/108

 gust of air comes from between her legs, blowing out the   candle. The wind is so strong, it begins to blow papers and   the Professor back. 
 CINDY 
 There. That's better. 
 Cindy gets up and walks over to the Professor. Only the desk  stands between them. Cindy grabs him by his tie, choking him 
 as she pulls him up onto the table. 
 PROFESSOR 
 I take it you're not mad at me. 
 CINDY 
 I wouldn't go that far. 
 She grabs his belt and pulls him into her, then holds the   apple to his mouth. He takes a bite and she mashes it hard   into his mouth, then pulls it out along with his dentures.  He quickly pops them back into his mouth. 
 Cindy rips open his shirt to reveal unusually large nipples   for a man. 
 Then unbuckling his belt and pants to reveal an adult diaper 
 underneath. 
 She pushes him back onto the desk and straddles him.  PROFESSOR 
 I don't like this, this... 
 CINDY 
 (pinning him down) 
 Why don't you shut up, Professor?   Just relax. 
 Cindy reaches her hand down the Professor's pants. She feels 
 something then stops and stares deeply into the Professor's   eyes. 
 CINDY 
 I think she's starting to suspect   something? 
 PROFESSOR 
 (Confused) 
 Who? 
 Suddenly, Cindy's face turns into RAY'S FACE.  RAY 
 Your wife! 
 The Professor screams, then pushed RAY off him. He gets up  Page 54/108
 from the desk and starts fixing his pants and runs out of   the room. 
 ANGLE ON: 
 Cindy's face as it morphs back. 
 CINDY 
 Oh, my God. It happened right here.   She came home. She saw them. 
 PROFESSOR 
 Saw who?! 
 CINDY 
 Don't touch me!! 
 Cindy passes out. 
 Dwight rushes in, sees the Professor, his pants by his ankles,  
 and Cindy unconscious on the floor. 
 DWIGHT 
 What the hell?! 
 PROFESSOR 
 It's not what is looks like. She's   having a breakdown. Help me get her   to her room. 
 DISSOLVE TO:  EXT. HELL HOUSE -- THE NEXT DAY 
 Clouds and an overcast sky set a dark mood over Hell House.  
 The grey skies tell us a storm is brewing.  CUT TO:  INT. FOYER -- CONTINUOUS 
 Buddy, coming down the main stairs notices the Professor   duck behind a door. 
 Buddy investigates, following the Professor.  CUT TO:  INT. BASEMENT -- CONTINUOUS 
 Buddy slowly creeps down the steps. He peeks around the   corner, keeping the Professor in sight. Buddy sees the   Professor enter the lab. 
 CUT TO:  INT. LAB -- CONTINUOUS 
 DWIGHT 
 Professor, we need to talk. 
 PROFESSOR 
 What is it, Dwight? 
 DWIGHT 
 I think we should consider cutting  Page 55/108

 the experiment short. 
 PROFESSOR 
 What? 
 DWIGHT 
 The force in this house is far greater   than I anticipated. In one night I   recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic   fields, the E.U.P. is picking up   white sounds everywhere. 
 PROFESSOR 
 That's why we came here, remember?  DWIGHT 
 Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This   poltergeist is becoming increasingly   more violent. We all could be in   danger. I say we pull the plug. 
 PROFESSOR 
 Whoa, Dwight, I say when we pull the   plug. Get a hold of yourself. Dwight,   we're on the verge of greatness and   I'm about this close to getting laid.   Now, the bus will be here on Monday.   Until then no one leaves. 
 CLOSE ON: 
 BUDDY 
 He's been listening to everything. 
 PROFESSOR 
 Now, here are the keys to the gate   and the cell phone. No one gets access   to either, understand? 
 Dwight nods yes. 
 CUT TO:  INT. SHORTY'S BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 
 Shorty is watering the seed plant. It is a tremendous size.  
 It's as tall as a tree. 
 Shorty closes a window, and climbs into bed.  He reached over and sets his digital alarm clock to wake him 
 at "C.P. Time." 
 Next, he pulls back the covers on his bed and pops a gold   tooth out of his mouth. He then places it in a little   drawstring bag marked "Tooth Fairy" and puts it under his   pillow. 
Page 56/108
 Finally, he closes his eyes. 
 Suddenly, he's awakened by the sound of rattling chains and   creaking floors. 
 SHORTY 
 I can't sleep like this. 
 He pops a tape marked "Ghetto Lullabies" into his radio and   pushes the play button. 
 The sounds of gun fire, police sirens, and a WOMAN screaming 
 are heard. 
 WOMAN (V.O.) 
 They done killed my baby! Why Lord?!   Why? 
 SHORTY 
 Ah, that's better. 
 Shorty tries to sleep, but just tosses and turns.  SHORTY 
 I know what I need. 
 Shorty finds a joint and lights up. 
 CUT TO:  INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS 
 Alex is now pacing the floor, smoking a cigarette, pissed   off. She goes over to her "Ouija Board" and begins to try   summoning the ghost. 
 ALEX 
 (moving the arrow  
 along the board) 
 Hello?... Ghost?... Baby, are you   there?... I've been waiting on you   for almost ten minutes now! Where   are you? 
 CUT TO:  INT. SHORTY'S BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 
 Shorty, sitting up, totally stoned, talking to a "Wilson"   volleyball. 
 The rest of this scene to come. 
 CUT TO:  INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 
 Alex is now sitting on her knees in the middle of a circle   of candles. She's chanting as she rocks back and forth.  ALEX 
 Oh, ghost of the night, I beseech   thee. Oh fickle fleeting ghost of   the night, I beseech thee. 
Page 57/108

 Still no response. 
 ALEX 
 (pissed) 
 Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! 
 She begins to tear up the room. 
 Smashing lamps and vases against the wall.  Ripping his portrait down and kicking it with her foot.  Tearing the feathers out of her pillows with her bare hands.  CUT TO:  INT. SHORTY'S BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 
 Shorty lies in his bed, totally paranoid. His eyes wide with 
 fear. Every sound makes him jump. 
 Suddenly, there's a bolt of lightning, and it begins to rain. 
 SHORTY 
 Ahhh!!!!!! 
 Shorty jumps out of bed and runs around the room looking for 
 the volleyball. 
 SHORTY 
 Wilson! Wilson! Wilson! 
 CUT TO:  INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 
 Alex is sitting in a corner, her hair a mess, her make-up   running. An empty wine bottle and glass, along with an ashtray  
 filled with half-smoked cigarettes are at her feet.  MUSIC CUE: 
 THE SOUNDTRACK FROM "MADAME BUTTERFLY" PLAYS.  Alex, staring straight ahead, flicking the light on and off. 
 She is Glenn Close in "Fatal Attraction." 
 CUT TO:  INT. SHORTY'S BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 
 Shorty, still counting, is interrupted by another flash of   lightning, and rumbling of thunder. The lightning illuminates  
 the weed plant, giving it an ominous shape.  Shorty, terrified, clutches the volleyball.  SHORTY 
 One one thousand. Two one thousand.   Three one thousand. 
 Suddenly, the weed plant comes to life. Its limbs smash the  Page 58/108

 window as it reaches in and grabs Shorty. 
 Shorty screams. 
 Ray, Buddy, and Brenda enter. 
 They see the plant using the sheet like rolling papers rolling  
 Shorty into a human joint. 
 They all rush to help him. 
 CUT TO:  INT. CINDY'S BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 
 Cindy is reading Carolyn's journal. 
 CAROLYN (V.O.) 
 Tonight, Hugh and I made love for   the first time. Ha, ha, ha, talk   about little. I can't take living   with him any longer. He's becoming a   monster. Darkness is all around us.   Poor Hanson died today; burned alive   in the furnace. They say it was an   accident, but... 
 Cindy closes the journal. 
 CINDY 
 Oh, my God! 
 Suddenly, her door slams. 
 CLOSE ON: 
 Cindy's closet. A bright light begins to glow inside. Cindy   sees the light. She sits up. Suddenly, her bedroom door slams  
 shut. 
 A huge wind starts to suck the items in the room into the   closet. 
 Cindy grabs the headboard at the bed and starts to yell for   help. 
 CINDY 
 Help! somebody help! 
 CUT TO:  INT. SHORTY'S BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 
 A bolt of lightning strikes the tip of the human joint,   lightning the tip on fire. 
 SHORTY 
 Help! Help! He's trying to smoke me,   son! 
 Ray and Buddy grab Shorty and pull him to safety, just as   the plant is sucked out of the window, into the night.  Just when they think it's over, they hear the sound of Cindy 
Page 59/108
 screaming. 
 BRENDA 
 Oh my God, Cindy! 
 CUT TO:  INT. CINDY'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS 
 Cindy clings for dear life to the bed as BAM! Alex kicks in   the door just as Cindy's panties slide down to her ankles.  ALEX 
 You cheating son of a bitch! Touch   her and I'll make sure that's the   last piece of possession you have.  (ALTERNATE) 
 You son of a bitch! Oh, what you   gonna play like this? I know you   didn't do that! 
 The wind stops, dropping an unconscious Cindy to the bed.  ALEX 
 What, one woman isn't enough for   you? Must you channel every girl in   this house? How would you like it if   I fucked another ghost, huh? 
 Heavy invisible footsteps make their way to the door.  ALEX 
 Where do you think you're going?   This isn't finished. That's just   like you, every time things get   serious you disappear. 
 The door opens and slams shut as Alex continues to scream   after him. 
 ALEX 
 Don't forget! I know where you rot!  (then to herself) 
 Selfish bastard. All you entities   are the same. 
 Enter Buddy and Dwight. 
 BUDDY 
 What happened here? 
 ALEX 
 Ask your poltergeist stealing whore!  Alex storms out. 
 DWIGHT 
 She's in shock. We have to get her   in a tub of water. 
Page 60/108
 CUT TO:  INT. BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS 
 Buddy places Cindy in the tub, turns on the water, and   splashes some in her face. 
 Dwight checks her pulse. 
 DWIGHT 
 She's okay. She won't be able to   move for awhile. Her body has to   recover from the trauma. Just leave   her here. 
 Buddy and Dwight exit. 
 CLOSE ON: 
 The tub faucet still running. 
 CLOSE ON: 
 The drain plug. It closes shut. The tub starts to fill with   water. 
 CUT TO:  INT. BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS 
 Cindy is still in the tub. As her eyes open. Terror crosses   her face. 
 The bath water is rising above her chest. 
 CLOSE ON: 
 Cindy's hand. She can barely move a finger.  CLOSE ON: 
 Cindy's foot. she wiggles it over to the chain holding the   plug. 
 The bath water is now at Cindy's mouth. 
 Cindy lifts the chain with her foot, then slams down her   heel up-ending the drain plug. 
 Relief... until she realizes the water is still rising.  Her foot digs down the drain and pulls out a clump of hair.  Water at her eyes and still rising. 
 Her foot hops out of the tub and grabs a plunger.  The foot plunges the drain. Still nothing. Water rising.  Cindy, head tipped back. All we see is nostrils.  Water spills out of the tub and onto the floor.  Cindy's foot grabs a pen and paper, writes a note, stuff it   in a bottle, and then tosses the bottle into the spilled   water. 
 The bottle floats away. 
 CUT TO:  INT. FOYER -- (OR WHATEVER ROOM EASIEST TO DO THIS GAG) --  Water pours in the room around the group's feet.  RAY 
Page 61/108
 I say we leave now. 
 Everyone agrees. 
 BRENDA 
 Wait. I'm sensing someone else in   danger. 
 CRASH!!! A bottle smashes across Brenda's head.  SHORTY 
 (holding a broken  
 bottle) 
 Don't start that shit again! 
 The note falls out of the bottle. 
 ALEX 
 Look, a note. 
 BUDDY 
 (reading note) 
 "Help, I'm drowning -- Cindy." 
 GROUP 
 Cindy!!! 
 They all rush to the bathroom. 
 INT. BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS 
 Cindy, totally submerged, staring fare to face with a whale. 
 Suddenly, she is lifted out of the tub. 
 BUDDY 
 You okay? 
 Cindy nods "yes." 
 BUDDY 
 Now we got everybody. Let's get out   of here. 
 CUT TO:  INT. KITCHEN -- A SHORT TIME LATER 
 ALEX 
 She sings a happy tune as she cooks breakfast.  Cindy, Ray, Theo, and Brenda gather around the island. Shorty  
 enters. 
 SHORTY 
 Damn, it smells good. 
 He reaches for a piece of bacon. Alex slaps his hand.  ALEX 
 That's for someone special. 
 SHORTY 
 I'm glad somebody got laid. 
 Alex smiles. 
Page 62/108

 ALEX 
 I never kiss and tell. 
 ANGLE ON: 
 THE ISLAND 
 Shorty joins the group. 
 (Note: During this scene, no one is paying attention to Alex) 
 SHORTY 
 Yo, there's some freaky shit in this   house. Y'all hear that loud banging   and screaming? 
 ALEX 
 (giggles) 
 Sorry about that. 
 CINDY 
 Brenda was right. There's more to   the story than the Professor told   us. I found a secret room. It had   all these news clippings about Hugh  
 Kane. He was a very evil man. 
 ALEX 
 (talking to the sky) 
 Ah, they just don't know you the way   I do. 
 CINDY 
 I found a picture of his wife. 
 ALEX 
 Wife?! 
 Alex grabs the plates of food and throws them in the trash.  ALEX 
 Let that bitch make you breakfast.  Cindy passes the picture to Theo. 
 THEO 
 Wow! She looks just like you... except   she doesn't have as many split ends   as you and her skin isn't as oily.  Theo passes the picture to Ray. 
 RAY 
 Yeah, and sometimes your eyes get   all squinty and it looks like you   got Down's Syndrome. 
 Brenda takes the picture from Ray. 
 BRENDA 
 Yeah, girl, damn near twins... except  Page 63/108

 she's more sophisticated and classy.   You got that cute, trailer park look.  Brenda shows the picture to Shorty.  SHORTY 
 No doubt... and her tits are perfect,   not at all pointy or funny looking.   You got them National Geographic   orangutan titties. 
 Cindy snatches the picture back. 
 CINDY 
 Okay, I get the point. 
 THEO 
 So, whatever happened to her?  CINDY 
 She killed herself a week before he   died. 
 ALEX 
 Oh, he was a widower. Why didn't you   say that?... 
 (addressing the sky)  Don't worry, sweetie, I can whip up   a new batch in a flash.  CINDY 
 I think he wants me. 
 ALEX 
 Ha! Right bitch! 
 Everyone looks at Alex. 
 THEO 
 Cindy, that does sound a little crazy.  Buddy enters. 
 BUDDY 
 She's not crazy. I saw the picture,   and I'll tell you guys something   else, the Professor is up to   something. Him and Dwight got a whole   lab set up in the basement. We're   here for an experiment, alright, but   it ain't insomnia. I heard Dwight   tell the Professor there's a   poltergeist in this house and we   could be in danger. 
 THEO 
 What? I'm getting outta here.  BUDDY 
Page 64/108
 We can't leave. The gates are locked   and Dwight is the only one with the   keys. 
 THEO 
 Don't worry. Give me five minutes   alone with Dwight. I'll get the keys.  CUT TO:  INT. BASEMENT -- LATER 
 Dwight, working on equipment, is distracted. Theo, standing   in the doorway, dressed very sexy. 
 THEO 
 Hello Dwight. 
 DWIGHT 
 Hi. 
 Theo swaggers over to Dwight. 
 THEO 
 What are you working on? 
 DWIGHT 
 Just a little experiment. 
 Theo rubs his shoulders. 
 THEO 
 Work, work, work. Is that all that   you do? 
 DWIGHT 
 Well, there's a lot riding on this   project. 
 Theo straddles Dwight. 
 THEO 
 The Professor might have everyone   else fooled, but I know who the real   brains of the operation is. 
 DWIGHT 
 You do. 
 THEO 
 That's what turns me on about you,   Dwight. You're so smart. 
 DWIGHT 
 And sexy. 
 THEO 
 Of course. So sexy. 
 She runs her fingers through his hair. 
 THEO 
 Ooh, you hair is so soft and silky.   What do you use on it? 
Page 65/108
 DWIGHT 
 Just a little Rogaine. 
 Theo notices clumps of Dwight's hair has fallen out into her 
 hands. She wipes it on his shirt. 
 THEO 
 And those sexy eyes. 
 She removes Dwight's glasses. 
 CLOSE ON: 
 Dwight's eyes, both looking in different directions. He has   no muscle control. 
 Theo quickly puts on his glasses. 
 THEO 
 What do you say we put on some music?  Theo turns on the radio. 
 She turns to a station. 
 SONG ONE "WALK ON BY..." 
 She quickly changes the station. 
 SONG TWO "WALK THIS WAAAY!..." 
 Again, she changes the station. 
 SONG THREE "THESE BOOTS WERE MADE FOR WALKING..."  Theo turns off the radio. 
 THEO 
 What do you say we make our own music?  She kneels in front of Dwight stroking his thighs.  THEO 
 You know, Dwight, I hear you're the   only one who has the key to the gate.  DWIGHT 
 That's right. 
 THEO 
 What if I wanted to borrow those   keys? 
 DWIGHT 
 Oh, I couldn't do that. 
 Theo unbuttons Dwight's pants. 
 THEO 
 Sure you can, baby. Look, you help   by giving me the keys, and I'll help   by giving you... 
 She pulls his dick out and is about to give him a blow job.  DWIGHT 
 I don't need your help. I can do it   myself. 
Page 66/108

 Dwight starts sucking his own dick. 
 Theo looks on in shock. Dwight is going to town on himself.  
 Theo grabs an object and smashes Dwight in the head, knocking  
 him out cold. She rifles through his pockets and takes the   keys. 
 She exits. 
 CUT TO:  INT. LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 
 The group is gathered in the living room. Shorty watches TV. 
 Theo rushes back to the group. 
 THEO 
 (dangling keys) 
 I got 'em. 
 BUDDY 
 Great! We should leave before it   starts to rain. 
 Suddenly, lightning and thunder. Rain pours against the   window. 
 THEO 
 I say we wait till the rain lets up,   then we make a break for it. 
 ANGLE ON: 
 NEWSCASTER on TV. 
 NEWSCASTER 
 This just in... Heavy rains will   continue to plague the region for   the next two days. 
 BRENDA 
 We'll just call a taxi. 
 NEWSCASTER 
 Now, an update on the recent taxi   strike. No progress in sight. 
 CINDY 
 Hey, we can take my car. 
 NEWSCASTER 
 There's been a major recall on all   Japanese made cars. Auto makers warn   when exposed to rain the cars explode.  LOUD BOOM and FIREBALL out window. 
 RAY 
 Fuck it. We'll hike if we have to. Page 67/108
 NEWSCASTER 
 The bodies of six hikers were found   today torn to shreds by wild animals.  SHORTY 
 I know, we can build a plane and fly   outta here. 
 NEWSCASTER 
 Now, that's just fucking stupid.  Buddy shuts off the TV. 
 BUDDY 
 Alright then, we'll just hunker down   for tonight. Maybe we'll get a break   by morning. 
 CUT TO:  INT. LAB -- CONTINUOUS 
 The Professor enters and finds Dwight with his head in his   lap. 
 PROFESSOR 
 Dwight, what the hell are you doing?   Dwight? 
 No answer. 
 The professor lifts Dwight's head and sees what he was doing. 
 PROFESSOR 
 Now that's a talent. Dwight, wake   up. 
 Dwight slowly comes to. 
 DWIGHT 
 (groggy) 
 I can do it myself. 
 PROFESSOR 
 Yeah, I can see that. Later I want   you to teach me that trick, but right   now we have a job to do. 
 DWIGHT 
 The keys. She took the keys. 
 The Professor notices Buddy on the monitor, unplugging the   cameras. 
 PROFESSOR 
 Shit. They're onto us. Keep an eye   on them. I'll take care of this little   shit. 
 The Professor exits. 
 CUT TO: Page 68/108

 INT. DINING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 
 Buddy climbs down off a chair and joins Ray.  BUDDY 
 I think we got the one's up here.  RAY 
 I think it's time we had a little   talk with the Professor. 
 CUT TO:  INT. BASEMENT -- MOMENTS LATER 
 The Professor exits the lab and heads for the stairs.  Out of the corner of his eye, he catches sight of a beautiful  
 female ghost in flowing white robes. She illuminates a   brilliant white light. 
 PROFESSOR 
 Hello?... Have we met?... Hi... 
 The ghost lures the Professor down the corridor.  NEW ANGLE: 
 We are in a different section of the hallway.  The Professor continues to follow the ghost. He has a bit of 
 trouble keeping up. 
 PROFESSOR 
 (calling after) 
 Ummmm... Hello?... Umm... 
 The Professor follows into yet another area of hallway.  NEW ANGLE: 
 The ghost tempts the Professor into a pitch black corridor.  PROFESSOR 
 Ummm... Are you Mrs. Hanson? 
 (ALTERNATE) 
 Ummm... Who are you, you gorgeous   creature? 
 The Professor disappears into the darkness.  He takes out a lighter to illuminate his way.  PROFESSOR 
 Hello?... Hello? Are you hiding?  (ALTERNATE) 
 Where are you, sexy pants? 
 A horrific look crosses the Professor's face. The beautiful   spirit morphs into Hugh Kane's Ghost. 
 The Professor takes a beat. 
 PROFESSOR 
 (resigned) 
Page 69/108

 What the hell? I've done worse. 
 The Professor walks into the darkness. 
 (REST OF SCENE TO COME) 
 CUT TO:  INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 
 Alex sits in front of her vanity mirror, wearing a sexy robe 
 and nightgown. She brushes her hair, humming to herself   happily, full of anticipation. 
 She takes her perfume -- "Obsession" -- and dabs some on her 
 neck, behind her ears, inside her thighs. Then she puts the   bottle to her mouth and -- glug, glug, glug -- drinks the   whole thing down like Gatorade. 
 Alex applies hot wax to a waxing strip then to her legs,   tearing it off. Satisfied her legs are smooth, she does her   underarm. She then applies a wax-soaked strip between her   legs then tears it off. 
 ALEX 
 Ouch! 
 She checks the strip to reveal her pussy lips stuck to the   strip. 
 ALEX 
 Oops. 
 She puts them back between her legs. 
 She rises and walks over to the old 19th century-style   portrait of the supposed ghost, which once hung prominently   downstairs. It now sits propped up in a corner of her room   with a shrine set up all around it consisting of candles,   little "I love you" hearts, and her vibrator.  Alex walks over to the portrait, regards it lovingly for a   moment, and then kisses the figure sweetly on the lips. Then 
 she works her way down the portrait -- hungrily kissing,   nibbling, and licking. When she pulls back, seductively, the 
 cobwebs, dust and spiders that were clinging to the portrait 
 are now all over her face. She doesn't care, she simply   brushes them aside -- she's in love. 
 CLOSE ON: 
 RADIO 
 D.J. (O.S.) 
 This one goes out to that someone  Page 70/108
 special from Alex over at the Hell   House. She says that even though you   two have only known each other for a   short time now, she feels a certain   connection to you that she's never   felt with any man alive. And even if   it doesn't work out between you two,   she wants you to know that there   will always be a special place for   you in the heart. So, Poltergeist,   this one's for you. 
 Alex climbs into bed and spreads rose petals all around.   Everything's ready. She sits back and waits.  While she waits, she puts the time to good use by doing some 
 sexual calisthenics. She lies flat on her back, sticks her   legs in the air, and stretches them wide apart a few times.  One-two-three-, one-two-three. 
 Then she gets on all fours and does a few stick-your-ass-  high-in-the-air stretches. One-two-three. 
 Then she does the simulated oral sex gesture, first with the  right hand, then with the left, making sure her forearms are 
 nice and loose. One-two-three, one-two-three.  A few facial and mouth exercises and she's done.  ALEX 
 Well, I'm going to sleep now. So, if   there's some ghostly man out there   who wants to take advantage of me,   there's probably nothing that I will   be able to do about it because I'm   really a heavy sleeper! Okay, here I   go. 
 Alex gets under the covers and pretends to fall asleep.  A beat and Alex opens her eyes and looks around.  ALEX 
 I'm asleep now. I really am. 
 She closes her eyes. 
 A count of ten and she sits up. 
 CUT TO:  INT. DOWNSTAIRS FOYER -- MOMENTS LATER 
 Just as the GANG is about to leave the house, a LOUD RUMBLE, Page 71/108

 along with a violent wind, all the doors and windows lock.  Everyone desperately tries to open a door or break a window.  CINDY 
 He won't let us go. He's going to   kill us. 
 DWIGHT 
 Quick, everyone to the lab. 
 CUT TO:  INT. BASEMENT STAIRS -- MOMENTS LATER 
 Dwight leads everyone to the basement door. He opens it. A   long flight of concrete steps. 
 DWIGHT 
 Those steps look kind of hard. I'm   gonna need some help. 
 By now, the group is so used to Dwight going down steps,   they simply give him a push. 
 Dwight goes tumbling down the hard steps. The gang running   behind him. 
 Dwight lands hard at the bottom of the steps. The group   tramples him as they rush by. 
 DWIGHT 
 (heroic) 
 Don't mind me. Save yourselves. 
 CUT TO:  INT. LAB -- CONTINUOUS 
 Everyone assembled inside. Dwight finally catching up, his   wheels slightly bent and his glasses, a mangled mess.  DWIGHT 
 Quick. Lock the door. 
 BUDDY and SHORTY lock the door. 
 CINDY 
 What are we gonna do? 
 DWIGHT 
 We have to destroy him. 
 RAY 
 How we gonna destroy what we can't   see? 
 SHORTY 
 I got it! We shave off our pubic   hairs and use the shampoo for ten   days. What? Ya'll never had crabs?  Dwight rolls over to a complex machine with a circle marked   on the floor in front of it. 
 DWIGHT 
Page 72/108
 Ghosts are just energy fields. We   can capture that energy. We can   dissipate it! But in order to do   that, we've got to get him in here.   On that spot. 
 BUDDY 
 That's great Einstein. How are we   gonna do that? There's a powerful   force out there ready to render us   helpless, tear on our flesh, and   penetrate our bodies. 
 RAY 
 He's right. I should go first. 
 BRENDA 
 He's so brave. 
 Dwight rolls over to a supply cabinet, opens it and starts   to hand out equipment. 
 Dwight is arming the teenagers, giving them each a strange   looking gun. 
 DWIGHT 
 These are highly experimental guns   that emit a bolt of concentrated   energy able to damage ectoplasmic   cells, giving it the ability to injure   or even destroy a ghost. There is no   ammunition. You only get three shots   a piece, so use it very wisely. 
 Goofing with his gun, shorty fires it at Brenda's butt,   burning it. 
 BRENDA 
 Hey! 
 Shorty laughs. 
 DWIGHT 
 Conserve your ammunition! 
 SHORTY 
 Sorry... right, right... 
 Shorty is startled by a cockroach and shoots it.  DWIGHT 
 The only way we're going to track   down these ghosts is if we're all   wearing one of these... 
 Dwight pulls out a DICK PUMP! They all look at him crossed.   Dwight realizes what he's holding in his hand.  BUDDY 
Page 73/108

 A dick pump? 
 DWIGHT 
 I mean these! 
 Dwight holds up a pair of goggles. 
 DWIGHT 
 These are thermo-goggles. 
 The kids are putting on their goggles, trying them out.  DWIGHT 
 These can be used to track the ghosts.   These goggles work on the principle   of body heat. They're so powerful,   they'll even show where body fluids   of any kind have been recently, even   if it been wiped clean. 
 The kids look at each other and notice Dwight has goo in his 
 face. 
 DWIGHT 
 He may be invisible, but we have the   advantage of being armed with the   most innovative and complex high-  tech equipment known to man. 
 BRENDA 
 How are we gonna stay in touch with   one another? Do we have walkie-talkies   or something? 
 DWIGHT 
 No, we have these. 
 Dwight brings out several sets of two paper-cups with a string  
 attaching the two. The string is only about 10-15 feet long.  DWIGHT 
 All the money was spent on the guns   and the goggles. 
 He hands them out. 
 DWIGHT 
 Let's get that bastard! 
 Alex points her gun at the group. 
 ALEX 
 No, I won't let you do it. 
 CINDY 
 Alex, what are you doing? 
 ALEX 
 Shut up, you slut. You think you can  Page 74/108

 take him from me? Well, over my dead   body. 
 Alex runs out of the lab. Cindy tries to stop her. Theo steps  
 in the way. 
 THEO 
 Let her go, Cin. 
 CINDY 
 But he'll kill her! 
 THEO 
 That means more screen time for us.  DWIGHT 
 Alright, let's split up. 
 BRENDA 
 Every time some scary shit goes down   and we need to stick together, you   white folks always say "Let's split   up." 
 THEO 
 She's right. We should stick together.  DWIGHT 
 Alright. Come on, you guys. 
 All four of the white people take off, leaving Ray, Shorty   and Brenda behind. 
 SHORTY 
 Ain't that some shit? 
 Ray, Shorty, and Brenda head off in the other direction.  CUT TO:  INT. SECRET STUDY/FOYER/LIVING ROOM/DINING ROOM --   CONTINUOUS 
 Alex exits the basement, frantically searching for the ghost.  
 She runs into the secret study. 
 ALEX 
 Huey, where are you? 
 GHOST POV: 
 The ghost, in the foyer, catches sight of Alex and tries to   hide. Alex sees him and starts for the foyer.  ALEX 
 Huey, Huey, baby, we have to talk!  To protect himself and do harm to her, the ghost hurls a   chair at Alex in the foyer. 
 ALEX 
 Baby? 
Page 75/108
 He hurls a statue at her. 
 Massive boulders come tumbling down the steps in hope of   crushing her. 
 Alex runs into the music room, smashing through a television. 
 ALEX 
 Come on, baby, we can work this out.  She takes a few steps and trips over the carpet.  ALEX 
 If we just stick together no one can   hurt us, love! 
 The piano flies up, landing on Alex. 
 ALEX 
 (in pain) 
 I think we have to get a little   therapy, Hun. 
 She crawls from under the piano. 
 As Alex heads for the dining room, the door slam shut.   Immediately, several knives come flying at her. The knives   form Alex's outline in the door. 
 Alex swings the doors open and enters the dining room.  Almost immediately, she's pulled (by the ghost) across the   dining room table, eventually landing full force to the floor. 
 As she lies there, the chandelier drops from the ceiling,   pinning her down. 
 Alex is dying. 
 Theo enters. 
 THEO 
 Oh my god! Alex! 
 Theo cradles Alex's head. 
 ALEX 
 I think I'm dying, Theo... I just   want you to know, you're the best   friend I've ever had... 
 (she coughs, pained) 
 Do you remember that time we met?  Theo nods, sadly. 
 ALEX 
 And remember the time in the sixth   grade, at the dance? We wore the   same dresses, but that didn't stop   us from having the best time ever.  Theo looks confused. 
Page 76/108
 THEO 
 Um... we -- 
 Alex coughs some more. 
 ALEX 
 And remember that trip we took to   Africa? That safari was so wonderful.   Me, you... best of friends... forever.  THEO 
 Uh, Alex, we've only know each other   one day. 
 ALEX 
 Oh... I guess I'll die now. 
 THEO 
 Okay... maybe that would be best.  Alex closes her eyes, seemingly dying. Theo starts to get   up. Suddenly, Alex opens her eyes... 
 ALEX 
 Oh, remember that time I got my   training bra and you -- 
 THEO 
 Never happened! 
 Theo looks at her watch, impatiently. 
 ALEX 
 Right... well, bye. 
 Alex lays her head down and seemingly dies again. Theo starts  
 to leave. Alex sits up again. 
 ALEX 
 My favorite memory was when we --  THEO 
 Would you die already?! 
 Theo looks around and grabs a pillow, finally smothering   Alex to death. 
 Theo slowly gets up, surveying the scene. 
 AS SHE EXITS, WE CUT TO: 
 INT. DOWNSTAIRS FOYER -- LATER 
 THEO AND DWIGHT 
 DWIGHT 
 You check down here, I'll check   upstairs. 
 Theo looks confused as Dwight crawls upstairs, dragging his   wheelchair. 
 CUT TO:  INT. BASEMENT AREA -- MOMENTS LATER 
Page 77/108
 Shorty, astray from the rest of the group, tries to find Ray 
 and Brenda. 
 SHORTY 
 (loud whisper) 
 Ray! Brenda! 
 Shorty takes a breather. He takes a seat and enjoys a blunt.  SHORTY 
 Ah! That's what I'm talkin' about.   Fuck this ghost hunting shit. I don't   know where to look for no ghost.  Shorty exhales the smoke, REVEALS the ghost sitting next to   him. 
 GHOST 
 (menacing) 
 Boo! 
 Shorty screams and jumps to his feet. 
 SHORTY 
 Yo, son, why me? What you want with   me? 
 Shorty blows out more smoke in an effort to reveal the ghost 
 as he bucks away. It works. Another puff and the ghost's   face appears again. 
 GHOST 
 Boo! 
 SHORTY 
 Leave me alone. Stay away from me.  Shorty continues the process of toking the blunt and blowing 
 the smoke. 
 Finally, Shorty takes a huge pull, blows the smoke out, and   the menacing Ghost face appears. Shorty curls in fear.  The ghost approaches Shorty. It's apparent that Shorty is a   dead man. The ghost brings his face very close to Shorty's.  GHOST 
 (playfully) 
 Boo. 
 The ghost laughs, hysterically, obviously high.  CUT TO:  INT. BASEMENT AREA -- CONTINUOUS 
 Ray and Brenda. 
 BRENDA 
 You hear that? 
Page 78/108

 She notices Shorty is gone. 
 BRENDA 
 Where's Shorty? 
 RAY 
 I don't know. He was right behind   us. Wait here. I'll be right back.  INT. BASEMENT AREA -- CONTINUOUS 
 Shorty and the ghost are joking it up. 
 SHORTY 
 (singing) 
 THERE'S SOMETHING STRANGE IN YOUR   HOOD... 
 GHOST 
 WHO YOU GONNA CALL? 
 SHORTY/GHOST 
 GHOSTBUSTERS!! 
 SHORTY 
 Hey, shotgun. 
 Shorty blows smoke in the ghost's face. They inhale. It   appears that Shorty has inhaled the ghost.  A count of two. Shorty exhales, blowing the ghost out.  GHOST 
 That was awesome. 
 The ghost runs straight at the wall, and goes through it.   He peeks his head through. 
 GHOST 
 You try. 
 Shorty takes a hit off the blunt then charges at the wall.  SLAM!!! Shorty knocks himself unconscious.  CUT TO:  INT. BASEMENT FURNACE ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER  Cindy and Buddy enter the furnace room. 
 BUDDY 
 Where the hell are we? 
 CINDY 
 It looks like the furnace. 
 BUDDY 
 Let's get outta here. 
 CINDY 
 Wait, I want to check something.   Give me a hand. 
 Buddy helps Cindy open the large furnace door.  CLOSE ON: 
 The inside of the furnace. Black ashes is all that can be  Page 79/108

 seen. 
 Cindy picks up an iron poker and pokes around the ash.  BUDDY 
 What are you doing? 
 Cindy sees something. She stops. 
 CINDY 
 I found Hugh Kane's wife's diary.   It said Hanson the caretaker died in   the furnace. 
 Cindy clears away the ashes to REVEAL a human skeleton.  BUDDY 
 Well, if that's Hanson, then who's   the guy with the hand? 
 CINDY 
 Hugh Kane. 
 Suddenly, the skeleton comes to life. It rises from the ashes. 
 Buddy and Cindy run. The skeleton follows.  CINDY 
 Let's split up and meet at the other   end. 
 CUT TO:  INT. BASEMENT AREA -- CONTINUOUS 
 CLOSE ON: 
 Brenda. She hears someone yelling. 
 Brenda peeks around the corner. She sees Cindy running towards  
 her. Cindy is screaming for help. Brenda ducks behind the   wall. 
 CINDY 
 Help! 
 BRENDA 
 Now, why that bitch gotta bring that   shit this way? I hope she didn't see   me. 
 Brenda peeks around the corner. Cindy trips and falls. The   skeleton gets closer. 
 BRENDA 
 Good! I hope that shit kills her and   just leaves. God is looking out for   me. 
 Cindy is back to her feet and hauling ass. Brenda ducks back  behind the wall. She is now nervous and shaking. The screams
