Some say juvenile.

I say genius!

Lizzie: Leave me alone!

Matt, I'm getting ready for graduation!

Matt!

Say goodbye to your little toy.

And say hello to Matt owning his big sister for eternity!

I mean, yesterday, you were in diapers, and now you're graduating junior high.

You're growing up, and I can't believe you're going to Rome for two weeks all by yourself...

Without me... without me... There... With you... without me with you there... you there without me.

Mom, I think that's about all the combinations of those words you can make.

Lizzie, this is a big day for you, sweetheart.

He's going to quote a dead guy.

As William Shakespeare once wrote, "be not afraid of greatness:

"Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them."

Thanks, dad, but I'm just trying to get through graduation.

Greatness can wait till this nightmare's over.

Hey, gordo.

So, do I look okay?

Lizzie, I'm your guy best friend.

You should really talk to Miranda about this stuff.

But she's in Mexico city.

Yes... your blue robe looks way cooler than all the other girls'.

Thanks.

Oh... My... God.

Only you would think that you could hide that powder-blue, puffy-sleeved, it's-kind-of-a-peasant-dress- but-it-might-just-be- a-baggy-disaster-of- questionable-fiber-content that you wore to the spring dance.

I...

Lizzie McGuire, you are an outfit repeater!

But I...

Maybe I'm an outfit repeater, but you're an outfit rememberer, which is just as pathetic.

Okay, does she not have anything better to do than make my life miserable?

I mean... We used to be best friends.

Yeah, but that was before she became popular.

McGuire!

Go.

Hey, Mr. Escobar.

Nice after-shave.

Oh, thank you.

Margaret Chan either has ebola or a very bad cold.

In any event, you're up.

U-u-u-up where?

At the podium.

You are going to deliver the class president's speech.

B-b-b-but what about the vice president?

Well, he's not graduating.

The secretary treasurer's next in line.

A-all I did was handle petty cash.

Well, I'm sorry, but you're not buying your way out of this.

Now, I want you to deliver your speech with as much pride and commitment as Margaret Chan would...

Even though you're no Margaret Chan.

You're no Margaret Chan.

You're no Margaret Chan.

You're no Margaret Chan.

Run!!

Ladies and gentlemen, uh, Lizzie McGuire.

Um...

U-uh, Margaret Chan couldn't make it tonight, so I'm going... I'm going to be filling in for her.

Not that any of us could really do that, but, um... Anyway...

Honey...

Honey, I'm losing the feeling in my knuckles.

I think that we can all agree that... Okay.

Junior high is filled with... Embarrassing and awkward and sometimes just downright humiliating moments... Right?

Uh...

Oh! Me neither.

It is so sad.

Wow.

It's like watching one of those little furry animals get k*lled on the discovery channel.

Mmm, I-I-I think Margaret Chan would want me to have some water right now.

Uhh! Oh!

Oh!

Play something! Do something!

Yes! Ha ha ha!

Come on! Mom! Dad!

I've got to get out of the country! Hurry!

Oh, honey, I know you're still upset, but it wasn't that bad.

Oh, really, mom?

Was your junior-high graduation on "good morning America"?

What kind of creep would send Diane Sawyer a video to embarrass you like that?

Oh.

Ugh!

What is that?

That is miss ungermeyer.

Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey!

She's gonna be our high-school principal for the next four years.

If you stay on her good side, it's a one-way ticket to an Ivy league school.

And what if you're on her bad side?

Excuse me! I need to mop up some puke.

Well, you...

You wind up as that guy?

No. You end up working for that guy.

Miss ungermeyer... Miss ungermeyer... Miss ungermeyer...

Can you make sure that there are no garlic or soy products in anything my Brittany puts near her mouth?

Miss ungermeyer, Luke has tennis elbow.

Could somebody please carry his luggage?

Miss ungermeyer, my son has asthma, and he must have his puffer.

Now, Brittany, she's got allergies... Miss ungermeyer...

Attention, parents...

Shut your pie holes.

I'm on a mission here...

To drag your progeny to 31 historically significant Roman landmarks in two weeks.

Now, when these back-talking miscreants return to you, they will have dipped their toes in a lake of culture, before assuming their destiny folding shirts at the outlet mall.

Now, many... actually, most of your classmates opted for the 36-hour bus ride to the water-slide wonderland.

Whoo!

But you...

You, who are not mouth-breathing trailer trash, you will get to experience the delights of LA città eterna.

Hmm-hmm.

Rome. The eternal city.

Did no one read the info packets?

Watch and learn.

Um, miss ungermeyer...

I just wanted to let you know that I'm...

I'm really looking forward to this exciting and academically enriching trip.

What's your name?

David Gordon.

David Gordon. Mm-hmm.

Now, I think in Italian, that means a sneaky brownnoser with a hidden agenda.

Huh?

What? Uh, uh...

Yeah! Come on, check those bags!

I want to see that junk in the trunk and a seat looking neat.

Okay.

Mom...

Okay, it's only two weeks, mom.

Honey, she... she's got to go. Two weeks.

Bye, sweetie. Bye.

Safe trip, huh? Okay.

Sweetheart...

Okay? Mm-hmm.

Flight 72 to Rome.

Final boarding, flight 72 to Rome.

Hey!

We're going to the land where they invented spaghetti!

Ah heh.

All passengers now...

Yeah, and the best part is Kate and all of the little blow-drying, teeth-whitening friends who'd be ragging on me right now for messing up graduation all went to water-slide wonderland.

How many lizzies does it take to screw in a lightbulb?

I don't know, but it only takes one to screw up a graduation.

Hey. Zip it.

Here we are. Step right up.

Number one... Number two...

Welcome to the hotel cambini.

Now, lest you think that there are many of you and less of me and it will therefore be easy to pull anything over on me, think again.

In addition to my being smarter, faster, and better-looking than most of you... heh heh...

I've also enlisted a little help.

The assistant manager of the hotel, giorgio averni, was a commander in the Italian Navy and is therefore as up on his game as I am mine.

Giorgio, would you like to brief my students on the security procedures of the hotel?

We serve... At 5:00...

The cookies.

Yeah.

You heard the man.

Room assignments.

David Gordon...

You will be rooming with Ethan craft.

You'll be in room 103.

Are those English or Italian numbers?

You got a problem with that, Gordon?

Um... No, ma'am.

Um, any... any room is just... just fine for me.

You know, being a spineless little jellyfish is almost as unattractive as being a little brownnoser.

McGuire!

Seeing as how Margaret Chan was unable to make the trip, you will be rooming with...

Okay, I am not, under any circumstances, sharing a room with...

I'll be taking the bed by the window.

You don't mind, do you?

Uh...

Ye-e-e-e-s!!

No.

I sleep much better with the Swiss eiderdown.

Lizzie, seeing as we're roomies and we're gonna be spending all this time together, I just wanted to let you know I understand that you want to put all that really embarrassing stuff behind you and just move on and have a fresh start.

You do?

Yes. I understand your dream.

It's a big dream.

It's a huge dream, and you can't do it alone.

In fact, I don't think you can do it at all.

Let it go.

Lizzie, come on.

Whoa!

Gordo, what?

Don't... don't worry. Don't worry.

Where are we going?

Look.

Wow!

Pretty cool, huh?

You know what, gordo?

I'm not gonna let Kate Sanders get to me.

Promise me something.

Anything.

Promise me that when we're here, we'll find adventures.

All right? This is our chance to start over...

I mean, do anything that we want to do.

Yeah. I-I know. You're right.

Hmm. You and me... adventures. Deal.

Deal.

The trevi fountain was designed by gian lorenza bernini and peitro da cortona in the 17th century.

And I'll tell you, it took about 100 years to finish this bad boy.

Now, throughout history, people have come from all over the world to make a wish and toss their coin in the trevi fountain.

I'll tell you something... those people are suckers, all right?

You got to make your own luck in this world.

All right, moving on, people. Let's go.

Scusi.

Grazie.

Scusi. Grazie.

You know what? Forget what she says.

Make a wish.

I'm in Rome with my best friend.

I'm good. You make one.

Okay.

Hmm.

Okay.

Isabella?

Huh?

Okay, I was wishing for smooth sailing through high school, but this will work.

Uh, I'm sorry.

It's just...

You look an awful lot like a friend of mine.

Paolo...

You have to get to your photo shoot.

We got to go.

All right, what you little halflings are feeling right about now is your energy flagging.

We got four more stops today.

I want you people to at least be able to shuffle from monument to monument.

We got one word for that, and it's gelato.

Look... it's him. Now, keep in mind that Italian ice cream has about twice the sugar of American ice cream.

Means you're gonna want about two scoops, huh?

I know i do. All right.

I-I don't mean to bother you.

I'm Paolo... Paolo valisari.

Oh, um, I'm Lizzie McGuire, and this is my friend gordo. Hey.

This is my friend Sergei.

Sergei, doesn't she look exactly like Isabella?

Isabella! Paolo!

Um...

Paolo!

Woman: Isabella! Isabella!

Paolo! Paolo!

Ciao, Paolo!

Uh, hmm...

Wow!

That really does look like me.

Paolo: Except for the hair, you could be her twin.

Isabella is my singing partner, and you're like her sister... like, uh... Two pods in a pea.

Lizzie... Can I see you again?

Maybe tomorrow?

Please?

What's the word for "yes" in Italian?

Si.

Uh...

No, I'm...

I-it's okay. I-I-I can cover for you.

Miss ungermeyer: Head check!

I'm sorry. I'm here with my school, so I can't. 1...2...3... forgive me if I embarrassed you. All right, stop moving around.

It is just that some people, when they come to Rome, they want to find adventure. 1...2...

Oh, it's okay. ...3...4...

I got some cool cheese. ...5...6...

Did you just say "cool cheese"?

Wah!

8...9... Paolo...

We must go. ...10...

Uh, Lizzie...

If you change your mind, I will meet you tomorrow morning at the trevi fountain at 9:00.

Hey, Gordon... McGuire...

Did you not hear me say "head check"?

15...16...

Who are you?

Paolo valisari.

Put your money in your front pockets.

She makes me very scared.

Join the club.

Lizzie...

Ci vediamo.

What does that mean?

We will see each other.

Hey.

You know, this Paolo and Isabella cd isn't so bad.

I mean, if you're into the alanis morissette-y, alternative, dark, like, brooding, I-never-go-out- into-the-sunshine- and-my-life's-a-miserable- black-hole-of-depression kind of thing, then you'd think they stink.

But, I mean, for a, like, driving-around-in-the-car- with-the-top-down, putting-on-your-lip-gloss, loving-life kind of thing, they're good.

Here. Listen.

♪ You don't have to sail the ocean ♪ yeah, not bad.

You use scented soap, huh?

What?

Um, it... n-never... never mind.

So, Paolo wants me to meet him at the trevi fountain tomorrow.

So go.

But that would mean I would have to sneak away from the group.

So?

So I'm, like, physically incapable of sneaking.

Lizzie, weren't you the one that said that we were gonna have adventures on this trip?

Yeah... we. We were going to have adventures.

And we will.

It just so happens that you have dibs on the first one.

Okay.

Just as long as we don't do anything that would get us tossed on a plane home by miss ungermeyer.

Uh... Unh.

Lizzie, are... are you feeling okay?

Uh...

Is this girl sick, or isn't she?

She doesn't have a fever, and yet she's in bed.

Ask yourself why a beautiful young girl on her first visit to Rome, probably seeking adventure, wants to lie in bed all day.

She's ill.

You know, I heard she fell down at graduation, made a complete fool out of herself.

And you think that could have something to do with this? I saw that on CNN.

CNN?

Often, the nervous system collapses after that type of utter humiliation.

Hmm.

Do you have any recommendations?

Oh, yeah, yeah. Um...

This young woman should stay in bed.

Uh, she... she should also eat two apricots.

Oh, for digestion or...

Uh, no, they're in season... very delicious.

Feel better, signorina McGuire.

You rest up, McGuire.

Don't want you to miss out on all the adventures of Rome.

Uh, doctor, I have a boil...

Sorry.

Uno, due, tre.

Tre. Tre. Tre.

Bene.

I...I just...

I had them all wish for you to come.

Hmm...

I don't have much time.

You know my chaperon, miss ungermeyer...

Wait, wait, wait.

I have to show you something.

And what precisely are you going to do with that information... just give it away, like you did with the graduation video?

Hey! She was really freaked out by that.

And you have what to show for it?

The pride of a job well done?

Try buying a ps2 with the pride of a job well done.

Oh!

Matt, Matt, Matt...

We've been over this before... cash up front.

Melina...

Are you staying for dinner?

I'd love to, Mrs. McGuire. Great.

We'll need extra energy to work on our summer reading list.

Well, in that case, I'll make some brownies.

Oh.

I've said it before... you're weak! Weak!

Don't do anything without consulting me first.

You rock.

Hey, Paolo...

Can I ask you something?

Si, carina.

Um... I know that our lives are a little different... actually, like several universes different.

But doesn't your friend Sergei ever get tired of following us around everywhere?

Actually, Sergei's my bodyguard.

So, you see, between me and Sergei, you'll always be safe.

Whoa!

How famous do you have to be before you need a bodyguard?

Paolo, go! Go!

I-it's miss ungermeyer! It's our bus!

Go, go, go! I cannot.

Excuse me, miss... miss ungermeyer...

Didn't we just pass the castel sant'angelo?

Yep. What about it?

Oh, I just noticed that it's not on our itinerary.

That is correct.

Well, s-shouldn't it be?

I-I mean, it... it w-was a papal residence, and it does contain frescoes from artists influenced by the school of Raphael.

What are you up to, Gordon?

N-n-nothing.

I-I just figure that, While in Rome, we should be exposed to as much renaissance, raphaelite work typified by chiaroscuro and hellenic mythical imagery as humanly possible.

Whew.

Ah, Gordon... You are on the list.

And the list is not a place you want to be.

What is this? Only in Rome, huh?

You know how to move that thing, or you want me to do it for ya?!

What are you looking at?

Want a piece of that... a piece of the ungermeyer?

And over there by that statue... you see it?

Yeah.

That's where the artist caravaggio had his opponent burned at the stake.

Oh, wait... or was it the pope who had caravaggio burned at the stake?

Either way, this neighborhood was tough.

Paolo...

Si, carina?

Do... You still love her?

Who? Isabella?

Si.

Of course I still love her.

But like a sister.

So why did you break up?

It's, um... It's complicated.

What?

I mean, yes, we've been voted "best pop duo of the year" again.

Uh, but I want to do more serious music.

And when I told this to Isabella, she said flat-out "no."

So I was forced to tell her, "this is it.

This will be our last cd together."

What did she do? Did she totally freak out?

She totally freak out.

And, yes, I feel awful about that, but what about me?

I need to grow as an artist, you know?

Yeah.

So, the other day when I saw you, I just... I don't know, I had this crazy...

I just... I don't know.

W-what?

I had this crazy idea that maybe you could help me.

Come on. How crazy could it be? Just tell me.

No, I can't. It's too... it's too...

Please. Okay.

Isabella and I are supposed to present an award together at the international music video awards.

Cool!

I-I mean, cool for regular people like me, but for you, I guess it's just like work.

Oh, no, no, no, no. I-it's cool for me, too.

You get all kinds of free gift baskets and stuff.

But now because Isabella's so mad at me, she's refusing to appear.

The record company's threatening to sue her if she doesn't show up.

And what about you?

For me is no problem. I write the music.

I don't know where it comes from.

It just comes from me.

♪ LA LA LA LA see? So I can go solo.

But Isabella...

She needs the help to sing.

You mean Isabella lip-synchs?!

Please, please, please, please, please!

You must promise me you will speak of this to no one.

Imagine what would happen to Isabella's career.

Oh, that's so sweet. You still care about her.

You're definitely broken up, right?

Si.

So, when I saw you yesterday and I saw how all those people thought you were Isabella, I got my crazy idea that maybe you could...

Pretend to be Isabella for one night and present the award with me onstage.

Present an award? O-onstage?

In front of an audience?

I-I-I'm really not good in front of crowds.

I could never do that.

Of course you can do it.

You are magnifico.

I don't know Italian... But I know what that means.

I don't know, Paolo. I...

Don't worry, carina.

I could never ask you to do this crazy thing.

No. You know what? You don't have to ask.

If this is gonna help you and Isabella, then...

I'll do it.

Grazie!

Prego!

Head check!

Gordo. Gordo.

You, Lizzie McGuire, are actually presenting an award at the imvas with Paolo?

No... me Isabella with Paolo.

What? It's a long story, but I'm doing it because the real Isabella won't.

You're actually gonna get up onstage in front of all these people?

Well, that's the great thing about it, gordo, is it's not gonna be me.

It's Paolo's idea to help Isabella because he still loves her.

But not romantically... like a sister.

He is so amazing.

And he's 17!

I mean, for being so famous and so used to getting everything that you want, he's just...

He's just so kind.

For real?

Look, that's a lot to say about someone just knowing them a day.

I-I know that.

But I feel like I've known him my whole life, you know?

A-anyway, um...

I just wanted to come by today and thank you.

I mean, I had the most magical day of my life, and it wouldn't have happened if it weren't for you.

It was that good, huh?

You're such a good friend.

The sting.

What sting?

You want a little mano a mano?

See, this is one of the reasons that me and you aren't friends...

'cause I-I never have any idea what you're talking about.

You see, some dudes get the approach.

Others, the sting.

That Italian dude... he's big-time approach.

I actually feel my brain turning into goo.

Embrace the sting.

That's what you're vibin' here from Lizzie.

Wait a minute.

Now, you actually think that I'm jealous of Paolo?

Word.

Oh, no.

No, see, that would mean that I like Lizzie as more than a friend.

See? What do you mean you and I have trouble communicating, bro?

You're wrong, man.

Whoa!

This girl looks freakishly like my sister!

Ow. Zoom! Zoom!

Another freakish coincidence.

I mean, she has the same necklace as my sister's.

Huh.

Why do we even pretend you're in charge?

Okay, let's see what this says.

Ow.

"Isabella goes blond.

"Italian pop duo Paolo and Isabella

"wowed the crowd outside a gelato shop

"near the trevi fountain, showing off Isabella's new blond hair."

They must think that Lizzie is this famous singer!

And if I show this to my mom, Lizzie will be so busted!

If you show this to your mom, it's worth nothing.

But if you show this to the Italian tabloids... we will be rolling in cash, my friend.

Interesting!

"We"?

Not up to toughing it out on the streets with us, miss McGuire?

I could try, miss ungermeyer...

No, I just hate seeing you being denied the cultural experience of being in a foreign country.

I mean, you missed seven points of historical significance yesterday.

I know. It's really k*lling me too, miss ungermeyer.

Which is why I thought I'd bring you a little something to help ease the pain, hmm?

Mmh, well, that's really thoughtful of you.

Well, seeing as how your teeny-tiny little body just doesn't have the strength, we're gonna have to let your mind do the wandering.

Ah!

The rise and decline of the Roman empire, hmm.

I'd like one report on the rise and one on the decline.

Ouch!

If I didn't have a headache a minute ago, I do now.

You don't have a problem with that, do you, McGuire?

Um... No.

I mean, what else do I have to do?

You're doing a very kind thing for Isabella.

Uh, Paolo, where are we?

Via condotti.

It is one of the most expensive shopping districts in the whole world.

We must find you the perfect outfit for the awards.

Woman: Ah!

Oh, hey, Isabella, Paolo!

Ciao!

Your hair is so blond and, uh, innocent.

Who did it? Um...

Th... the island that we were on was really, really sunny, so it was j-just the sun.

Sun? We must get sun, too, no?

Ciao, Bella!

Ciao, ciao, ciao.

They are so tall!

You see, they all want to be you.

No, they want to be Isabella.

Here, sit and I'll get franca.

I will just be a moment.

Whoa! Take your time.

I'll just be sitting here in heaven.

Hard as it is to imagine, as we look at the crumbling ruins of the forum, that this was once the center of commerce, religion, and politics in ancient Rome.

All right, now, the forum came into being in the sixth century b.C., and with it, a new urban culture was born.

Uh, um... Di... yeah, craft?

Is it time for the spaghetti?

It's, like, 9:00 in the morning.

Yeah, so? You never had leftover spaghetti for breakfast?

I don't eat carbs.

Oh, and I suppose you never had a spaghetti sandwich, either?

This cultural experience is, like, so wasted on you.

Excuse me, where did you buy that Prada bag?

Craft! Sanders! Separate.

Oh, we did, miss ungermeyer. And thank God.

Why don't you people, uh, do something at your, uh, skill level here?

Take a ten-minute shopping break while I choke down an espresso.

Whoa, this dude definitely spent way too much time on his biceps and not enough on his abs... totally old school.

Si, si, si. Uh... Wha... nice spy, bro.

Yeah, watch and learn.

The slow curve. Works every time.

I've got to go talk to them.

Hey, bro, that's not how the slow curve works.

They come to us.

Um, eh, ciao.

Ciao. Ciao.

Do you guys speak English?

Yes.

It is your friend we like.

Word.

Word? Um, is that his name?

Yeah, sure.

Hey, listen, do you guys know who that is on the cover?

Oh, Isabella.

Certo. Certo.

Do you think you guys could translate it for me?

Um... Only if you introduce us to word.

Well, can I keep the magazine, then?

Deal!

All right. Let's go.

Ciao, word.

Word?

Mmh?

Franca: English?

Paolo: Yes, she's speaking only English.

Our new single is in English and Isabella needs to practice.

What have you done?

Uh... Uh, uh...

You look... well, you look like a schoolgirl.

Maximus, what is wrong?

You love Isabella.

Nice Maximus.

Very odd.

There is something...

Something very different about you.

Um...

Rest.

The rest on the island did Isabella a world of good.

She is transformed.

Yeah.

Well, I cannot put clothes on this.

You... fix the hair.

Fix the eyebrows.

Fix the lips.

Oh! And fix the ears!

Fix the ears?

Jewelry.

Jewelry.

Now, that's a language every girl understands.

Okay. Diva... good.

Tacky... bad.

We'll have to fix that.

Okay, none of these are me.

Why are you laughing at me?

Because you're not supposed to be you.

Okay, well, if I have to go onstage in front of an audience as Isabella, then I-I'm gonna have to be confident, and that's, like, the thing I'm worst at.

We are all the same that way.

Not you.

Yes, me. And Isabella, too.

But it's how she works through her fears that makes her strong.

For instance, Isabella doesn't let franca di montecatini tell her what to wear.

Isabella tells franca.

Okay, so you're telling me to tell franca di monteca-teca-tecatini how... how I should dress?

Si.

Test your strength, Isabella.

Vai! Vai, vai.

You don't like my clothes?

No. No. I-I love your clothes.

But I don't want you to dress me.

What?!

See, I'm not your Barbie doll.

I am Isabella parigi, and I dress myself.

So, choices.

I-I need choices.

Whoa.

I really like these two. You pick.

Both.

Both.

Wow.

This is the exact same color that I wore to my spring formal, and Danny Kessler thought that I looked...

Unh-unh.

Look at all of you. You'd think that I'm American.

I am, how you say, um...

Awesome?

The island. You should go more often.

Mmh.

Kate: I cannot believe that not one Roman guy has asked me out yet.

Ugh.

Look.

Paolo...

We gotta go!

Where's the zoom on this thing?

Uh, uh...

Hello? Excuse me.

Oh!

I'm sorry. I was just...

Hup! Head check!

Let's go! On the bus, then back to the hotel!

Come on! Come on! Go!

Andiamo! Andiamo!

Giorgio: Si, hold on one second!

Okay! Hello.

Hotel cambini. This is giorgio.

Go! Huh? What?

Wait.

Si. Excuse me, can you fix this?

It will not close. Ah, but, uh...

Why is it open when there is no rain?

This umbrella is very stubborn.

Please, it's bad luck to have an open umbrella inside. Go! Go!

No, in the hotel cambini, there is no bad luck. Hey, thanks.

Ah!

Ungermeyer: All right, people, one at a time. No running.

Ha ha ha!

Ha! Ha ha! Age before beauty, huh?

Oh. You look strangely large and familiar.

Which floor?

Oh. Thank you. First.

Okay.

Little hint for you... you want to push the button, elevator moves.

Elevator is not safe.

You an employee here?

No. No.

Well, then, who are you to tell me whether or not the elevator's safe?

I am Sergei.

Sergei.

Well, Sergei, you're gonna have to stand down immediately.

Just because you are one hunk of slavic muscle does not mean you're not gonna make it on my list!

Elevator is safe now.

Hey! Your umbrella!

Feeling any better?

Mom?

Still a little warm.

Miss Sanders, would you be so kind as to look after her for me?

"Look after her" as in do stuff for her?

Miss ungermeyer, why should I be punished?

I'm not the one who's sick.

Next year, I'm joining the mouth breathers at water-slide wonderland.

You are so busted. You've been out of this hotel room.

What?

How do you know?

Please...

Your eyebrows finally match, your hair has highlights...

Fresh manicure.

I smelled acetone the second I walked in the lobby.

Okay, but you didn't rat me out to miss ungermeyer.

Yet.

Not until I figure out what's in it for me.

Now spill, dorkerella.

You'll never make me talk!

I-I know that this sounds insane, but...

I think Paolo really does like me.

How could this happen? How did you get my trip?

How is Lizzie McGuire living this fantasy and I can't even get an Italian boy to buy me a plate of spaghetti?

Um, Kate, you don't eat spaghetti.

I'd eat carbs if an Italian boy bought them for me.

So...

I suppose you want me to keep quiet about this?

Yeah. I'd appreciate that.

Well, I'll keep it quiet if you keep it quiet about me keeping it quiet.

And...

When we get back home, I'm the cool one again, and you turn back into a pumpkin.

Oh, my God. It's her.

What are you doing?

Uh, it's a long story.

What do you want? We're closed.

Uh, I-I just wanted to talk to Lizzie.

So talk.

I was kind of thinking maybe, you know, outside in the courtyard.

If this is about that whole bizarre, parallel-universe, Italian-rock-star, Lizzie's-suddenly-a-diva thing, I know all about it.

She figured it out.

Evil and smart.

Embrace it. Fear it.

I thought you might want to take a look at this.

I'm on the front cover of a tabloid!

Ha!

I wish to thank everyone who's always believed in me for this great honor.

Do you know what that says?

It says that Paolo and Isabella are supposed to be singing at the music awards.

Well, it's got to be a mistake.

Oh, I had some Italian girls translate it.

Paolo didn't tell you?

Mmh, no.

Don't you think it's kind of weird that he tried to hide this from you?

Oh, my... can you believe it?

Maybe it's just a last-minute thing, gordo.

Aren't these things planned for, like, months in advance?

Gordo, when did you become an expert on Italian award show thingies?

It's called common sense, Lizzie, which I happen to have a lot of to make up for my lack of the slow curve.

Slow curve?

Forget it. Look...

If you want to believe some Italian kid that you think you know after two days because he's an international superstar, is really rich, and has nice hair...

Be my guest.

Gordo...

Oh, my God! He's early!

Lizzie...

Oh, my God, I gotta go get dressed.

Oh, don't worry.

I'll cover for you in case miss ungermeyer does one of her psycho, middle-of-the-night, head-check things.

Thanks. I owe you.

Duh!

Mom, dad, I found something on the Internet I think you both should see.

What is it?

Well, since Lizzie's in Europe, I thought I'd do a little e-search on Italy.

That's nice, son.

But what I found out... it's not so e-assuring.

In fact...

It may shock you.

What are we looking at?

Maybe nothing, and, uh...

Maybe something.

You see, when polled, 74% of Italian teenage boys said they would most like to date American girls.

Where'd you get these numbers?

They're available for anyone who has a computer.

You don't have to worry about your sister, son.

She's very well-chaperoned. Miss ungermeyer's there.

Yeah, what is she... 5'1 ", 5'2" Max?

Oh, please.

Matt, as interesting as this is, where are you taking it?

All right, you caught me.

I always do.

I don't know why I even try.

I'll deny I ever said this, but...

I miss my sister.

There. I said it.

Now you know.

I know I rag on her all the time, but now that she's gone, I... I...

Oh, honey...

We miss her, too.

So, so much.

I feel so alone!

Oh! Li... listen to me.

You don't have to make fake pie charts.

You just come to us with the truth, okay?

I know that now, mom.

It's just so hard.

I miss her so much!

Oh!

I can't believe I let you talk me into Letting her go on that trip!

I'll go get the passports.

Oh, honey.

Shh.

Hmm, hmm, hmm.

Ah, hmm, ah.

Hmm...

Uh...

Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmmmm.

Hmm?

Hmm.

Hmm!

Paolo.

Si.

What is this?

Uh... A car.

Look...

Are we supposed to sing?

Scusa?

Don't speak to me in Italian.

It's too adorable.

Are Paolo and Isabella supposed to sing at the awards?

Si.

Si?! Well, why didn't you tell me?

I wanted to tell you, but you told me not to telephone the hotel.

Come on, come on, get in.

I'll explain everything on the way.

I want to show you the tivoli gardens before sunset.

Come on.

We have to get you back by 10:00.

Okay.

So, where is Sergei?

You're not the only one who sneaks off at night.

Paolo: Isabella and I were going to sing, but after Isabella would not speak to me, I told the producers we refuse to perform.

I said Isabella had throat problems.

So, what happened?

I mean, what changed?

Isabella did.

The real Isabella or me Isabella?

You... a reporter heard her speaking in front of the gelato shop, and he reported Isabella's voice was fine.

And he said her English was very good, by the way.

But then the record company called, and now they're going to sue if we don't sing.

What?

So, they're gonna make you sing?

I... I mean, us sing?

Don't worry, carina. I'll make this work.

Look.

Ah!

Look, Paolo, I-I don't think this is going to work.

I mean, I cannot sing in front of an audience.

I won't even let my mom hear me sing in the shower.

Lizzie, I will teach you all you need to know.

Okay.

So, what is Isabella gonna do when she sees me being her?

Ah, but she won't... she's off on some island trying to get over all of this.

Come on.

Here's my vow to you.

I, Paolo valisari, will never let you, Lizzie McGuire, be embarrassed.

If I fail...

I have to spend seven days with that scary head-check woman.

Her name's miss ungermeyer.

Carina...

Hasn't everything I've promised you come to be?

Everyone believes you are Isabella, you are having the time of your life being someone else.

You even told franca di montecatini to buzz off!

Don't you trust that we can do the singing together?

I guess.



Well, you shouldn't.

What do you got there, little man?

Uh, nothing. What's this?

Uh, that's not Lizzie! No!

Yes, it is. No, it isn't.

I know my daughter. I gave her that necklace.

All right... tell me what you know that I don't.

It's only a 14-hour flight, dad.

All right, people, swallow those biscotti.

We got a big day... the pantheon, the colosseum.

Oh.

Uh, halt!

Got to get these apricots to McGuire.

She looked sick as a dog this morning.

Mr. Gordon, you having a problem?

N-no, I just...

I-I'm starting to agree with Ethan.

I-I think we need to eat more spaghetti.

You da man!

Sorry.

Mr. Gordon, is there a reason you don't want me to go upstairs?

No, I-I just really think we should get going.

Uh, so much roma, so little time-a.

Well, you know, when I get upstairs... and I will get upstairs...

I expect to find miss McGuire in her bed.

Well, you... she may be in the bathroom or... or something.

You know, I'm beginning to get the feeling she was never sick to begin with.

No, no, no! She... she was!

You know, I bet this whole thing was just a clever ruse to sneak out of this hotel, wasn't it?

Yeah, it... it was.

It was?

Well, Lizzie and I were talking about adventures, and, uh, I don't know.

Ah, spit it out, Gordon.

Lizzie's upstairs. It... it's me.

I'm the one who's been sneaking out.

You?

But... but... feels good to get it off my chest.

You realize what this means?

I...Shouldn't look to you for a college recommendation?

You should look for your suitcase, Gordon.

You're goin' home.

Oh, I pegged you right from the start.

David Gordon... sneaky little brownnoser with a hidden agenda.

Well, you're busted.

Love lifts us up where we belong.

Wow. This place is so cool.

Si.

Are you sure it's okay that we're here?

Si.

And here is where, exactly?

It's the rehearsal hall.

But the colosseum will look more like this.

Sergei!

If you want to convince the world you're Isabella, you must take the stage.

You must dance...

and sing.

♪ Have you ever seen such a beautiful night? ♪ just move your mouth with the words.

Oh. So you want me to lip-synch.

Lizzie, no one's going to hear you.

I'm gonna go grab gordo so I can tell you guys together, okay?

You won't find him.

What?

Why? Where'd he go?

Probably getting on a plane right now.

Why?

He totally covered for you and got himself kicked off the trip.

I-I don't believe it.

W-why would he do that?

You're seriously asking that question?

Giorgio, you've got to call the airline and see if gordo's plane has left yet!

D-do you know what flight he's on?

Si, si.

I will call.

I cannot believe that gordo would do this for me.

M-maybe he's not on the plane yet!

Maybe I could go to the airport and I could...

And... What?

I don't know.

I am now on hold.

Woman on p.A. System: This is the final boarding call for lufthansa flight 6240 grazie.

Departing for Los Angeles.

Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

Mm-hmm.

Mm-hmm.

Mm-hmm.

Mm-hmm.

Mm-hmm.

Mm-hmm.

Thank you very nice.

The plane is gone.

Who is this girl?

I have been relaxing on the island, trying to forget about this whole situation. Excu... Isabella!

Can somebody please tell me what is going on?

I can. That's my friend Lizzie McGuire.

Hey!

Hey!

Let him go. Let him go.

I demand for you to tell me everything you know about this Lizzie McGuire.

I demand for you to tell me everything there is to know about this... this Paolo valisari.

I left him and all of my thoughts about him on the island.

Well, you may have left him on the island, but my friend Lizzie is out there pretending to be you so that you don't get sued.

We need to talk in private.

Gordo's life is ruined because of me... selfish me!

So what are you gonna do now?

It's over.

I'm going to turn myself in to miss ungermeyer.

Lizzie, you'll get sent home, and then you won't be able to help Paolo.

Okay, well, I'm never going to be able to get through this the way I feel now.

Okay. Fine. Quit.

But then everything gordo did will be for nothing.

Now, you know things are bad when Kate starts making sense.

I know one thing's for sure.

What?

I'm not gonna have to act sick today.

Mr. craft, you are in the most historic and beautiful city in the world.

Has that had no effect on you?

Well, actually, it has.

The cobblestones are shredding my wheels.

Switched to a pair of birdhouse pterodactyls.

Have you even made a dent in your reading list?

I finished it.

You read 11 books?

I mean I read the list.

Shh.

Shh.

McGuire.

Lizzie McGuire.

Si, si, we are in the travel guides.

No. No.

No.

We're the parents of Lizzie.

Ah! Si!

Uh, I'll call a cab. It's very far.

Anybody else want to step up to the plate?

Who's asking for McGuire?

I've left you four messages already, but she's been under my watchful eye all the while.

Where'd Sanders go? Hmm.

Lizzie? Sweetheart?

Honey?

Cool!

Where is Lizzie?

And do you have any embarrassing photos or videos of her while she's been here?

Ow.

Uh...

You better tell us where Lizzie is, or this deck's gonna catch some serious air.

Well, it's possible that she's at the international music video awards doubling for an Italian pop star named Isabella, who's, like, totally her twin.

I-I still have to get dressed and everything.

Si. Franca delivered it. It's waiting in your dressing room.

Lizzie, you have time.

Calm down. You can do it.

Of course i can do it.

This is moi we're talking about.

I don't think I can do it.

Lizzie, you must.

We've rehearsed this.

You know all the steps. You know all the words.

You will be great... I know.

How do you know?

Because...

Because you shine like the light from the sun.

Paolo... Paolo.

Man: 31 minutes till showtime.

Lizzie.

Gordo!

Oh, my God! What are you doing here?

Lizzie, Lizzie, that's... that's not important right now.

Y-you need to listen to me.

Of course it's important! I feel so bad.

I cannot believe that you would do that for me.

Wait a minute. Why aren't you gone? It's a long story, but... okay, well, I want to hear all about it, but I've got to go get my dress on, okay?

Lizzie, listen to me.

Paolo is setting you up.

What are you talking about?

Actually...

He is setting me up.

Freaky, huh?

Way freaky.

Way, way freaky.

That whole story about Paolo doing his own music and going solo... that's Isabella.

She's the one that sings live.

Si. Paolo is the one that lip-synchs, not me.

Isabella is the one that wants to quit the act.

Paolo I-is just a liar.

This has all been some crazy scheme to set you up and embarrass you onstage so it looks like Isabella can't sing.

Si, si. It's true.

Paolo wants to destroy Isabella's career.

But Paolo would never do that to me.

I don't believe you.

Isabella...

Lizzie, who are you going to believe, this boy you are knowing your whole life or... This boy you are just meeting who says...

"You shine with the light from the sun"?

Okay. Well, then, you're here now, so go and sing.

But I am not blond.

Paolo will know that it's me, and he'll make an excuse to leave.

But if we want to get back at him in front of the whole world on live TV, we must make him sing... and really sing, not lip-synch.

But how? What am I supposed to do?

I can't sing live!

Change! Change!

Change your clothes and go up there and do what you rehearsed, okay?

Everything will be fine. I-I promise.

I have a plan. What plan?

Man: 28 minutes till showtime.

So, what's the plan?

I don't know.

Okay.

No, see, it doesn't matter about the tickets, because my daughter is back there impersonating a famous pop star, so... I got to get in!

That's what everyone says.

All right. Enough of this!

Uhh! Uhh!

Ha! Let's go!

Sandro, did Paolo bring the voice track for me tonight?

No. No, he did not. There is no track.

Paolo, he says you're gonna sing live, like you always do.

Paolo and Isabella!

Sandro, turn down Isabella's mic.

What's that? Turn down the mic!

Not anymore, Paolo. I quit.

Lizzie got everything you're supposed to get when you go to Europe... adventure, romance, total confidence.

Yeah?

Well... If all that can happen to Lizzie McGuire, the only thing i know now is...

I don't know anything.

That's hot.

What?

Girls who think they know everything are just a turnoff.

Really?

Oh, totally.

Like, what about you not ratting out Lizzie?

I mean, that was just so...

Not you.

That's good.

Si.

Aaaaaaah!

Mom, dad, I'm so glad that you guys made it.

You would have never believed me.

That is for sure. I thought after you found out all the things that I did, I would be grounded.

You're grounded for the rest of the summer, sweetheart.

But we're really proud of you.

You know, lying, even for a good reason, is beneath you, Gordon.

Yeah. I know. I know.

I'm a lying, spineless, brownnosing jellyfish with a hidden agenda... I got it.

Well, that may be true, but I'll tell you something.

Little miss diva over there told me everything.

The way I see it, you're a pretty loyal friend, Gordon.

And loyalty goes a long way with the ungermeyer.

Hmm? Thanks.

Hey, just think about it... we got four years of high school to look forward to together, huh?

Ooh. Sammies.

Sergei is hungry.

So is miss ungermeyer.

You are strong woman.

You protect cubs like lioness.

Sergei is impressed.

Hmm. You're still on my list.

As long as I am at the top.

Hey, there!

I bet you're wondering... who is this Lizzie McGuire and where did she come from and what are her most embarrassing moments?

Well, I can give you total access to all of that for a very competitive price.

Hmm. When in Rome...

Yeah, yeah. Do as the romans do, right?

No.

We do not blackmail our sisters.

As a former commander in the Italian Navy, I am ordering you to leave the country.

No!

Hey.

So...

One last sneak-away for old times' sake?

Yeah. Sounds good.

Okay.

Aha.

No!

So, are you gonna miss it here?

I don't know.

Kate says that I should just stay and have my stuff shipped over from home, because when I leave here, it'll never be the same.

Well, she's wrong, as usual.

You didn't have to be in Rome for all this to happen.

You think?

Trust me.

You had it in you the whole time.

Gordo?

What?

Thanks.

You're welcome.

Yeah.

So, um... Want to get back to that party so we don't get in any more trouble?

Yeah. I can't afford any more... more trouble.

Yeah.
