MIKE: 
Abby… 
MIKE: 
Come on. I know you’re in there. Let’s go. 
Abby, come on. 
Okay, okay. 
You’re being a jerk. 
You know I have somewhere I have to be. 
Come on, let’s go. Five minutes. 
I need you dressed. 
(toy squeaks) 
Five minutes. 
(crowd chatter) 
JEREMIAH: 
memory as if experiencing it for the first time anew, no longer a passenger but an active participant.” 
(chuckles) 
This stuff for real? 
Some people think so. 
Guess it depends on what you believe. 
Summer of ’82, I traded a mint condition Cal Ripken Jr. rookie for a used copy of “Missile Command.” 
That card’s probably worth 800 bucks now. 
I wish I could participate in that memory and actively kick my own ass. Can I keep it? 
No. 
WOMAN: 
side because I don’t want it to melt the ice cream. 
And can I get some whipped cream on top and three cherries? 
CINDY: 
Hey. 
You want your usual, right? 
Uh, yeah. 
So, when are you gonna bring your sister by? 
We got this new flavor, Rainbow Explosion. 
I bet she’ll go crazy for it. 
Page 3/43
Mike? 
Hey! 
Hey! 
Hey! 
(grunts) 
(crowd gasping, murmuring) 
(grunting) 
WOMAN (distantly): Number 27? 
(echoing): 
(normal): 
Follow me. 
(humming a tune quietly) 
Mm. 
What is your deal, Mike? 
What are you, some kind of… head case? 
You beat up a man in broad daylight. 
In front of his child. 
Daddy! 
(people screaming) 
(panting) 
That was a mistake. Um… 
It was a misunderstanding. I-I thought… 
Just look at your employment record. 
Tire Zone, sales associate, two months, terminated. 
Insubordination. 
Media World, custodial staff, one week. 
It’s like you’re not even trying here, yet you sit before me asking for help. 
I am just trying to figure out who you are, Mr. Michael Sh… Hmm. 
Coffee? 
Sorry? 
Uh, would you, would you like some… some coffee? I made some coffee. No. 
I’m-I’m gonna be brutally honest with you here, Mike. 
Given your track record, your options… are gonna be extremely limited. I’ll take anything, okay? Any-any job you got. 
No. No. 
Look, I-I-I get that part. Um, it’s just… 
You know, it’s not that easy. 
Yeah. Thank you. 
I have a job for you. 
Page 4/43
Come on, sit down. 
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit. 
Okay, uh, well, what is it? 
It’s a security gig. 
Full disclosure: 
Right? High turnover. 
That’s what we call it in the business, but you get to be your own boss. Sort of. 
And you only have to worry about one thing. 
Keeping people out. 
And-and, you know, and keep the place tidy. 
That’s two things. 
You want the job or not? 
How’s the pay? 
Not great. 
But the hours are worse. 
(quietly): 
Excuse me? 
I can’t do nights. 
(chuckles) 
That’s such a shame. 
Yeah. 
Thank you. 
Wait, uh… 
In case you have a change of heart. 
(TV playing quietly) 
MIKE: 
Thanks for babysitting. 
There’s Stouffer’s. 
Should still be warm if you’re hungry. 
WOMAN (on TV): 
these rings, and you can have it within… 
I wish someone would buy me a ring. 
Did Abby eat? 
What do you think? 
(humming a tune) 
MAX: 
Page 5/43
MIKE: 
(continues humming) 
What do we got? 
Okay. 
Well, that good-looking guy I recognize. 
Who are all these other punks? 
My friends. It’s not done yet. 
Well, look, you can finish up after we eat, all right? Come get some food. 
I’m not hungry. 
Abby, please, come eat. 
Come on. Here. Please come. 
No! 
Come and… 
Abs, with the day that I’m having, can you just eat some food? You’re sitting on my friend. 
You know what? I don’t care. 
Do whatever you want. 
But you should know what happens to little kids who don’t eat their dinners. 
Their bodies stay the same size forever. 
And they never get to ride the adult rides at the amusement park. My friend says you’re an idiot. 
Mm. 
At least I’m real. 
(sighs) 
(tape whirring) 
(birds chirping on tape) 
(sighs) 
(imitating airplane) 
MAN: 
(woman laughs) 
Everything’s better swimming in ketchup. 
Right, Mike? Whoop. 
I’m gonna go grab a towel. 
Go watch your brother, okay? 
Okay. 
MIKE: 
(car engine starts) 
(engine revving) 
Garrett? 
Page 6/43
(heart beating rapidly) 
(panting) 
Garrett! Garrett! 
(shouting echoes, fades) 
(tape rewinding) 
(playful chatter) 
JANE: 
It’s not even 10:00 
and he-he can barely keep his eyes open. 
And this degenerate is who they entrust with the well-being of a mentally ill child. 
Jane, like I’ve said before, Abby is not mentally ill. 
Oh, right. 
Perfectly normal to sit around drawing pictures all day and-and talking to magical creatures who do not exist. 
Listen, I think we all just need to calm… 
Don’t tell me to calm down. 
You’re the doctor, and you’re making me feel like I’m the crazy one? And after… after what he did to that poor man… 
(crying): 
(Jane sobbing) 
I have really tried to play nice. I have. 
But I have to think about Abby now. 
Enough is enough. Doug? 
Doug. 
(gasps) Oh. 
JANE: 
I hope that you will sign. 
And if I don’t? 
Well, then, my lawyer and I will have to take you to court, where any judge with an ounce of sanity will see to it that you never see your sister again. 
That what you want? 
She-she doesn’t even care about Abby. 
All she wants is the monthly check from the state. 
(breathes deeply) 
But, I mean, she-she has some good points, though. 
I’m hardly fit to be raising a kid. 
Page 7/43
LILLIAN: 
MIKE: 
She talks to air more than she talks to me. 
I could drop dead tomorrow, and she’d be too busy drawing to even notice. You know, pictures hold tremendous power for children. 
Before we learn to speak, images are the most important tool we have for understanding the world around us. 
What’s real, what matters to us most. 
These are things children learn to communicate almost exclusively through pictures. 
Yeah, her pictures mean something. 
And who is at the center of nine out of ten of them? 
Me. 
Mm-hmm. 
Like it or not, you’re her world. 
MIKE: 
My aunt, she’s an idiot, but she’s right. 
No judge in their right mind is ever gonna side with me. Did you find a job yet? 
Okay. 
That would be a good place to start. 
(whimsical music playing over TV) 
(Mike sighs) 
(pressing phone keys) 
(line ringing) 
STEVE (over phone): Hello. 
Uh, hi. 
Mr. Raglan, this is Mike. 
Mr. “I can’t work nights.” 
Right. 
Uh, yeah, I was just calling to see if that job that you offered was, uh, was still available. 
Oh, it absolutely is. 
Why? Have you had a change of heart? 
(TV continues playing quietly) 
MIKE: 
STEVE: 
This place was huge in the ’80s with the kids. 
It’s been shut down for years. 
Page 8/43
The only reason they haven’t given it the old wrecking ball treatment is the owner’s a bit of a… 
Well, he’s kind of a sentimental guy, I guess. 
Just can’t bring himself to let it go yet. 
(laughs) 
Yeah. 
Had some trouble with break-ins over the years. 
Drunks and vagrants, mostly. Not ideal. 
Security system’s dated but fully functional. 
Floodlights on the outside, cameras inside and outside. 
Fair warning: 
(glass crunching) 
Anything happens, there is a breaker in the main office. Just flip it. 
(machines powering up) 
(lights clinking, buzzing) 
Uh, I guess that’s about it. 
You know… the rest is pretty easy. 
Just keep your eyes on the monitors and… and keep people out. Piece of cake. 
(sighs) 
STEVE: 
Hopefully. 
The hell? 
(upbeat music playing over TV) 
Welcome to Freddy Fazbear’s Pizzeria, a magical place for kids and grown-ups alike, where fantasy and fun come to life. 
If you’re watching this video, it means you’ve been selected as Freddy’s newest security guard. 
Congratulations. 
We’re going to have so much fun together. 
The genius who created Fazbear Entertainment opened Freddy Fazbear’s Pizzeria to indulge in his two greatest passions: family-friendly fun and cutting-edge animatronic technology. 
(scoffs) -State-of-the-art robotic engineering enables our characters to interact with guests in truly lifelike fashion, while cleverly concealed rechargeable lithium cells give them limited range to roam free. Let’s introduce you to the stars of the show. 
(static crackling) 
Page 9/43
(laughs) Adorable, aren’t they? 
Protecting these cuddly critters, and the proprietary technology that brings them to life, is now your sacred duty. 
Keep them safe, and help ensure that Freddy Fazbear’s Pizzeria is here to delight, dazzle and entertain 
(distorted): 
(static crackling) 
All right. 
(sighs) 
(gasps) 
(object thuds, clatters) 
Hello?

(quiet electronic warbling) 
(clock ticking) 
(static crackling softly over speaker) 
(static continues) 
(imitating airplane) 
MOTHER: 
Right, Mike? 
(chuckles) 
Go watch your brother, okay? 
Garrett? 
Garrett! 
(footstep crunches softly) 
What is this? 
Who are you? 
That car. 
Did you see that car? You see what happened? 
(static continues) 
Did you see who took my brother? 
Wait! No. 
(grunts) 
(watch alarm beeping) 
(panting, groans) 
Page 10/43
(beeping stops) 
(panting) 
(TV playing quietly) 
Hey. 
Hey, Max. 
(exhales) 
So? How’d it go? 
Uh… it was interesting. 
I should probably get out of here. 
Hey, by the way, I-I do intend on-on paying you, eventually. It’s okay. 
I know where you live. 
(chuckles softly) 
(vehicle approaching) 
(truck horn honking) 
(entry bell jingles) 
WAITER: 
Could I set you folks up with some appetizers? 
JEFF: 
JANE: 
We are not eating. 
WAITER: 
You do realize that lunch is the most important meal of the day? 
JEFF: 
Some people say that, but, you know, it’s just a theory. -Are you being paid by the word, or could we have a minute? 
All right. 
Thank you. 
JANE: 
Oh, you were about to tell me what a miserable failure you are. 
JEFF: 
My sister went over every inch of that dump a thousand times. If there was something to find, she would have found it. Now pay up. 
Uh, I’m sorry? (laughing) 
JEFF: 
Page 11/43
We had a deal. 
Yeah, that you were gonna find me hard proof of criminal endangerment. Instead, you’ve told me what a nice kid my niece is and that my nephew sleeps a lot. 
He really does, though. 
Sleeping is not a crime. 
Is that guy okay? 
I just realized I shouldn’t be hearing any of this. 
As a matter of fact, I shouldn’t be here at all. 
Sit down, Doug. 
So, I guess we’re finished here, unless either one of you has a brilliant idea, which I realize is highly unlikely. 
Why don’t we just kill him? 
(Doug sighs) 
Tempting. But no. 
What else? 
Mike was saying that… he really needs this new job to, like, look good on paper for the judge or something. 
Well, that’s all very fascinating, honey, but I am not hearing a plan. We toss the place. 
Go on. -Well, he’s a security guard, right? 
His job is to make sure nobody gets in. 
So, we get in, and we mess up the place good. 
We help ourselves to whatever we find along the way. 
Your nephew gets canned. 
Judge gives you the kid, and you give us… 
$2,000. 
One thousand. 
But do it fast, and don’t mess it up. 
I mean, you know, mess it up, but don’t… don’t mess this up. (thunder crashing) 
(grunting) 
Come on. (grunting) 
ABBY: 
(grunts) 
Abby, do you need something? 
No. -All right, quit playing and take that off. 
I have to go to work. 
I know. I’m coming with you. 
No, you’re not. 
Give me the vest. 
No. 
Give me the vest now. 
Page 12/43
I’m coming with you. 
ABBY: 
MIKE: 
I don’t want to stay here with Max. -Abby, stop. Hello? -Abby, stop. 
No! You can’t make me. 
MIKE: 
No, it’s mine. 
MAX: 
(Abby screams) 
Let go! (screams) 
Let go. No, no. 
MIKE: 
He’s taking my vest! 
Abby. 
ABBY: 
No. 
(door closes) 
(exhales) 
She’s all yours. 
(thunder rumbling)

MIKE: 
(footstep crunches softly) 
Wait, please. 
Please don’t-don’t… don’t run. 
Okay? I-I just want to know what you saw. Please. I’m begging you. 
Help me. 
Who took Garrett?!

(buzzer sounding) 
(thunder rumbling) 
(buzzer continues) 
(thunder rumbling) 
About time. 
Starting to think maybe you fell asleep on the job. Um… 
Can I, uh, help you, Officer? 
Please, my name’s Vanessa. 
And you must be? 
Um… 
The new security guard. 
Yeah. 
You’re bleeding, by the way. 
Looks nasty. 
Come on. I know where they keep the first aid kit. (thunder rumbling) 
(chuckles): 
Why Nebraska? 
Oh, you need a hand? 
I’m fine. 
You sure? 
Here. 
I’m a certified EMT. 
So if your heart ever goes out, I’m the one you want to call. You seem to really know your way around the place. Well, Freddy’s is on my beat. 
I like to stay well-informed. 
Also, I really loved this place as a kid. 
There. 
Page 14/43
That should do it. (sighs) 
Vanessa Shelly. 
Mike. 
Pleasure to meet you, Mike. 
(drawer closes) 
You doing all right this evening, Mike? 
What? 
Are you good? Are you okay? 
Is everything copacetic? 
Yeah, I know what “all right” means. 
Do you also know that your eyes are bloodshot and your heart rate’s through the roof? 
And aside from that gash on your arm, which… (chuckles) let’s be honest, is pretty frickin’ bizarre, you’ve been acting suspicious since the moment you opened the door. 
Yeah, look, it’s been a weird night. 
Sounds like Freddy’s. 
This place, it gets to people. 
It’s one of the reasons why you’re gonna quit. 
I’m sorry? 
Oh, yeah. 
You security hires, you never last. 
Have you met them yet? 
Met who? 
(lights buzzing) 
(games beeping, whirring) 
So, what are the other reasons? 
Huh? 
Why you think I’m gonna quit my job. 
Well, you tell me. 
Is this somewhere you see yourself ten, 20 years from now? I mean, what do I know? Maybe the benefits are great. 
(scoffs) 
I didn’t think so. 
Add to that the thing with those kids going missing. 
Wh-What did you just say? 
Prepare to have your mind blown. 
(chimes) 
(whirring) 
(“Talking in Your Sleep” by The Romantics playing)

This… this is… 
The best thing you’ve seen in your entire life? 
Want to dance? 
(electrical crackling) 
(music distorts, stops) 
(mechanical whirring) 
Maybe some other time. 
Wait, y-you said some kids went missing? 
Sure. Back in the ’80s. 
What happened to them? 
It was big news. 
That’s why the place shut down. 
Wow. 
You really didn’t do your homework, did you? 
And you’re not even wearing your badge. 
Got it. 
There. 
Now you’re official. 
(gate rattling) 
VANESSA: 
Some friendly advice? 
Don’t let this place get to you. 
Just do your job, and you’ll be fine. 
(indistinct police radio chatter) 
Yeah, sounds good. 
(cell phone keys beeping) 
(car engine starts) 
(phone line ringing) 
(phone vibrating) 
(beeps) 
JEFF (over phone): It’s showtime. 
As soon as he gets back, get the guys and meet me here. I think I see a way in. 
(soft electronic whirring) 
All right. 
Now, be quick but thorough. 
Maximum damage, minimum time. 
You see anything valuable, grab it, and we’ll, uh, settle up after. Page 16/43

Good? 
Yeah. Golden. 
Whoo! 
Yeah! (laughs)

NARRATOR (on TV): It’s feeding time for the giraffe. (whimsical music playing on TV) 
(TV continues playing quietly) 
Hey, Abs, what you working on? 
All right. 
I guess you don’t want this, then. 
It’s cool, huh? 
(softly): 
I’m trying my best, Abby, okay? 
(objects clatter) 
(on TV): 
You okay? 
I made a mess. 
I’m sorry. 
They’re just… they’re just papers, all right? They don’t… they don’t mean anything. 
Then why do you have them? 
Well, that’s complicated. Aunt Jane… 
I hate her. 
She’s mean and she smells like cigarettes. (chuckles) 
It’s not funny. 
You’re right, it’s not. It’s just, uh… 
Page 19/43
I don’t know, it’s nice that we can finally agree about something. 
(softly): 
Abs, no, I… 
(knocking at door) 
Hey. Vanessa. 
Hey, Mike. 
And hello. 
Vanessa, this is Abby. Abby, Vanessa. 
Hi, Abby. 
Mike didn’t tell me he had a daughter. 
Gross. 
No, uh, Abby’s my sister. 
Ah. Well, he didn’t tell me he had a sister either. 
Are you here to arrest Mike? 
MIKE: 
talk? 
It’s nice to meet you. 
What, um… what are you doing here? 
Somebody broke into Freddy’s. 
What? 
Wh-What-what happened? 
Recognize these? 
Look, it’s not what you think, okay? 
Th-Those are… They’re sleeping pills. 
They help me sleep. 
I know what they are, Mike. 
It’s written on the bottle. 
News flash: 
door, accident or not, you’re liable. 
It’s called criminal negligence. 
(scoffs) You wouldn’t understand. 
Well, then help me. 
‘Cause the moment I file that report, it’s out of my hands. You want to take a walk? 
So I used to have a brother. 
His name was Garrett. 
(sighs) And when I was… about 12, he was, uh, he was taken. And I was there when it happened. 
They never found the guy who did it, and they never found my brother. So there’s this theory that, uh, we can’t forget things. Basically, it says that every single thing that you see in your entire 
Page 20/43
life, down to the tiniest of details, gets stored inside of you. You just have to know how to look. 
Your brother… 
You think you saw who took him? 
I know I did. 
And I know that he’s in here, but he’s just… he’s… 
It’s buried. 
So every night, I dream, and I go back to that same memory, and I-I search for details. 
For any little thing that got overlooked. 
Yeah. 
And that’s usually the part where people tell me I’m crazy. I know what crazy looks like, Mike. 
This isn’t it. 
Not even close. 
And these? 
I mean, going back to the same dream, the same place night after night, it’s not easy, so the-the pills help. 
Some other things, like familiar sights, familiar sounds. “Pining for fun?” 
(chuckles) 
“Visit Nebraska.” 
(laughs) 
Your sister seems cool. 
So it’s just the two of you? 
Yeah. 
Yeah, it’s just us. 
Our mom died a little while back. 
And Dad, he couldn’t handle it, so… 
You know what’s crazy is, uh, when… when Garrett and I were kids, they were like those perfect parents you’d see on old TV shows. 
Yeah, ev-every night, we would sit down together, we’d have family dinner, and we’d hold hands and say grace, and… 
That actually sounds really nice. 
Yeah, at the time, I thought it was really cheesy. 
But then it’s gone. 
You and Abby, you still have each other. 
From where I sit, I’d say you’re lucky. 
(indistinct police radio chatter) 
(sighs) I should go. 
No more sleeping on the job. 
When you’re at Freddy’s, you stay alert. 
MAX (recorded): 
Page 21/43
(chuckles) Leave a message. Or don’t. 
(touch tones sounding) 
(line ringing) 
Come on, Max. Come on. 
MAX (recorded): 
(sighs) 
MIKE: 
are you gonna come out of my office. 
Do you understand? 
I understand. 
This is not a vacation, okay? You’re not here to have fun. Okay. 
Whoa, slow down, slow down, slow down. 
No, no, no. 
Abby? 
(soft creaking) 
Whoa. 
What happened? 
Give me your hand. 
Watch out. 
(glass crunching) 
Do you want me to turn the light off? 
(softly): 
Good night. 
It’s like camping.

(metallic clattering) 
Hello? 
I know you’re back there. 
Might as well come out. 
(low growling) 
(heavy mechanical footsteps) 
(car driving off in distance) 
You’re those kids, right? 
The ones who disappeared? 
Look. 
I don’t know how it’s possible that you’re here like this in my dream, but… I need your help. 
Please. 
Help me remember the man who took my brother. 
If we show you, what will you give us? 
Anything. 
I’ll give you anything you want. 
(girl screams in distance) 
(girl screams) 
(sniffs) 
Abby? 
(Abby screaming) 
ABBY: 
Abby? 
(mechanical clicking) 
(heavy footsteps approaching) 
(low growling) 
ABBY: 
(laughing) 
They wouldn’t stop tickling me. 
I thought I was gonna die. 
Freddy, this is my brother, Mike. 
(mechanical whirring and clicking) 
Abby, what is this? 
ABBY: 
I want you to meet the others. 
(electronic warbling) 
Mike, this is Bonnie, Foxy and Chica. 
Everyone, 
Page 23/43
this is Mike. 
(mechanical whirring and clicking) 
This-this is a joke, right? 
I mean, th-there’s someone here. 
There’s probably somebody controlling them, right? I mean… 
Okay, good joke! 
Congratulations! You got me! 
You can come out now! 
Hello? 
It’s okay, Mike. 
They just want to play. 
(laughs softly) 
We have to go home now. Come on. 
Hold on. 
They really like pictures. 
(drawing on paper) 
(mechanical whirring) 
I had a lot of fun tonight. 
Thank you for playing with me. 
Okay, okay, Abby, come on. 
Okay. 
Bye! 
(engine shuts off) 
(quietly): 
(sighs) 
(metal scrapes) 
It’s them. 
Hey, Abby, um, we need to talk about last night, okay? Um… 
So those, uh, those… machines… 
My friends? 
Your friends? 
Um… 
are they…? 
Ghosts? 
Yeah. 
Of course. 
How else could they make the robots move? Right. 
Can I have some more soup? 
Page 24/43
Yeah, sure. 
Hey, Abs. 
You know we used to have a brother, right? 
Garrett. 
I don’t… I don’t really talk about him very much. 
Neither did Mom or Dad. 
Yeah, it was hard for them. 
It’s hard for me, too. 
C-Can you explain this to me? 
You-you drew that, right? 
Okay, and… and-and you know what that is? 
Hey, hey, it’s okay. 
Okay, I’m not, I’m not mad. 
I won’t get angry at you. 
But I really need you to help me understand, please. That’s when Garrett got taken. 
Abby, who told you about that? 
W-Was it a-a boy with blonde hair? 
Did that boy ever tell you anything about the man driving that car? Anything at all? 
Okay, just think, think really hard, okay? 
No. 
All they talk about is a yellow rabbit. 
Okay. 
But… 
I can ask. 
I would really appreciate that. 
(kids’ laughter echoing) 
(girl screaming) 
(kids’ screams echoing) 
(car doors closing) 
ABBY: 
Yeah. 
My friends talk about her sometimes. 
What do they say? 
That she’s nice. 
Abby, if I asked you to wait in the car, would you? No. 
Abby, wait. 
Page 25/43
ABBY: 
Abby. 
Hey, Vanessa. 
MIKE: 
(Abby giggling) 
Mike. 
Vanessa. 
(chuckles) I missed you guys. 
MIKE: 
Guess you figured it out. 
Ghost children possessing giant robots? 
Thanks for the heads-up. 
Guys, we need help. 
It needs to be big so we can all fit inside. 
Abby, look. 
Now, this is all really fun and exciting, but these things are big, and they could be dangerous, so I think we need to lay some ground rules, all right? 
Vanessa, what do you think? 
I think we could use the tables for the fort. 
ABBY: 
(giggles): 
(“Connection” by Elastica playing) 
It needs to be higher. 
You did it! 
(song stops) 
(heavy thump) 
Are you okay? 
(song resumes) 
Page 26/43
VANESSA: 
ABBY: 
But I think it’s gonna rain soon. 
Sounds like we need a roof. 
I’ll go see what I can find. 
I’ll, uh… I’ll-I’ll come with you. 
(whispering): 
Okay. 
Yeah. 
(song ends) 
What are you looking for exactly? 
Tablecloths. 
They used to keep ’em back here for big events. 
Right. And remind me how you know that. 
Found ’em. 
(soft mechanical rattling) 
VANESSA: 
I wouldn’t do that. 
They’re spring locks. 
They’re on all the older models. 
They were designed to keep the animatronic parts in place so that, uh, a person could safely wear the suit. 
They tend to be pretty unstable. 
Let’s see. 
Ooh. 
Like I said, unstable. 
Is there anything else that you want to tell me about, Vanessa? ‘Cause you seem to know everything about this place. 
And what if Abby’d come in here? 
What if she’d found that thing? 
You’re the one who brought her, Mike, not me. 
What I can’t wrap my head around is why. 
All right, look. 
I think that they know who took my little brother. 
I can’t explain it, but when I’m here, I feel closer to Garrett. My dreams are more vivid, and it… it’s like I can almost… Change what happened? 
Did you ask them about this? 
Yeah, I tried. 
I don’t think they like me very much. 
Page 27/43
But… they do like Abby. 
Mike, you need to drop this. 
I don’t really see how that’s any of your business. 
I’m telling you, you need to let it go. 
Who the hell are you? 
Just someone who’s trying to help. 
Vanessa, wait. 
Talk to me. 
I’m trying. 
You’re not listening. 
Please. Finding the guy that did this is the only thing that matters to me. (song continues) 
(electronic humming) 
Abby? 
Wait. Abby, don’t! 
(loud, discordant note plays) 
(song stops) 
(ears ringing) 
MIKE (muffled): 
Abby? Abby! 
(coughing) 
(Vanessa sighs) 
(Abby whimpers) 
What happened? 
VANESSA: 
You just had an accident. 
You’re okay. 
I’m so sorry. 
(mechanical clicking) 
I don’t know what to say. 
Just go home, Mike. 
Take care of your sister. 
What are you so afraid of? 
In the storage room… 
I saw your eyes. You were terrified. 
Page 28/43
You can do whatever you want with your own life, but if you ever bring Abby back here again, I will shoot you. 
(engine starts in distance) 
(car door opens) 
ABBY: 
Why does everyone always look at you that way? 
(clears throat) 
(sniffs) 
(line ringing) 
(sighs) 
(line clicks) 
Hey, it’s Mike. 
I need your help. 
(dog barking in distance) 
(sizzling) 
Abby. 
Is that bacon? 
Hey, why don’t you, uh, get dressed and then come to the kitchen, okay? I want to talk to you about something. 
Okay. 
Wow, there’s my favorite little girl. 
MIKE: 
What did you do? 
Abby, look, I think if you just sit down, we can explain it to you, okay? No. 
I promise you, this is not what you think it is. 
I hate you. 
I hate you, Mike! 
(door slams) 
Well, I-I think that went well. 
(breathing heavily) 
She reminds me of you, you know. 
Always with the temper. 
Well, look, when she calms down, can you, um, tell her that I’m sorry and that I’ll-I’ll be back soon? 
Well, Mike, there’s a larger conversation that needs to happen here. So when you do get back, you and me are gonna have a little chat. Okay. 
(papers rustling) 
Page 29/43
You know what works for me? 
A warm glass of milk with chamomile and honey. I tell you… 
What an asshole.

MOTHER: 
(straining): 
GARRETT: 
(Mother chuckles) 
Hey, buddy. 
Well, don’t just stand there. Dig in. 
Sweetheart, what’s wrong? 
This… this isn’t… 
this isn’t how it happened. 
This isn’t real. 
BOY: 
What is this? 
This isn’t what I asked for. 
But it’s what you want. 
No. I just, I just want to find the man that… You’re lying. 
You want to save Garrett. 
That’s why you’re really here. 
To change what happened. 
To go back. 
But I can’t. 
He’s gone. They’re all gone. 
Really? 
You can have this dream every night. You can be together with him again. Like before. 
How? 
Page 30/43
BOY: 
We want Abby. 
Abby? 
They love her, Mike, and she loves them. You’ve seen her with them. 
You’ve seen how happy she is. 
It’s time to let her go, sweetheart. 
You were never the right person to take care of her. (breathing shakily) 
Okay. (sniffles) 
(voice breaking): Yes. 
You’re home. 
No. 
No, this is wrong. 
I don’t, I don’t want this. Listen… 
(heavy mechanical footsteps) 
I made a mistake! 
Please, I don’t want this! 
Do you hear me?! 
(breathing heavily) 
You leave Abby alone!

Not Freddy. 
They’re all waiting for you.

It’s time to go play. 
Silly Aunt Jane. (chuckles softly) 
She fell asleep. 
How do we get there? 
(“I Wanna Be Down” by Brandy playing in taxi) 
Where to, little lady? 
(taxi door opens, closes) 
(taxi rattling) 
What the…? 
Oh, my goodness! 
(giggling) 
Not cool. (sighs) 
Why do I always get the weirdos? 
(groaning, panting) 
Careful. 
I managed to stop the bleeding, but you’re probably gonna need stitches. Where are we? 
Police supply outpost. 
I found you, and, uh, you were… you were badly hurt. 
They tried to kill me, Vanessa. 
But I’m guessing you already knew that. 
Max. 
Her brother. 
You knew about them, too, right? 
It’s complicated. 
Yeah. 
(scoffs) Yeah. 
More complicated than possessed robots murdering innocent people? They weren’t innocent. 
Yeah, Abby is! 
Mike… -You saw Abby playing with them. 
And you knew what they were capable of, and you didn’t say anything! Mike, please just… 
Abby is in danger! 
Tell me what happened. 
In my dream… they asked me for Abby. 
And I said yes. 
It was a mistake, and I-I tried to fix it, but… 
What do they want with my sister? 
They want to make her like them. 
Page 33/43
Come on, let’s go. 
Where’d you go? 
(lights buzzing softly) 
VANESSA: 
searched Freddy’s from top to bottom. 
Every inch was accounted for. 
But they never found them. 
Hello? 
VANESSA: 
He was a very bad man. 
A very cruel man. 
Also a very clever man. 
He knew that parents would cry, and the police would come looking. And he knew there’s one place they’d never think to check because… (lights clanking) 
…why would they? 
I mean, why would anyone? 
It’s not just their ghosts that are inside of those machines. It’s their bodies. 
You have to understand, the… the kids, they don’t want to hurt anyone. It’s-it’s him. 
He influences them somehow. 
He took everything from them, but they don’t remember. Who, Vanessa? 
I tried to warn you. 
I really did try in my own way. 
But it’s too late now. 
He knows that you’re looking for him. 
He’ll be coming. 
You need to tell me who he is. 
VANESSA: 
He’s my father. 
(Garrett imitating airplane) 
You knew? 
(crying): 
This whole time. 
My brother, you knew. 
Not about Garrett, no. 
Page 34/43
A-At least… not when we met. 
I’m so, so sorry. 
Tell me how to stop them. 
Tell me how to save my sister! 
(electronic whirring) 
(“Talking in Your Sleep” by The Romantics playing loudly) 
VANESSA: 
We use these for animal control. 
(crackles) 
There’s a Taser on your belt. 
It won’t do permanent damage, but it’ll mess with the animatronic circuitry. 
Hopefully buy you some time. 
Come with me. 
No. 
Vanessa, you owe it to me, and you owe it to them. No, I can’t. 
If he’s there, I… 
I won’t be any use to you, believe me. 
He really messed you up, didn’t he? 
(girl screaming faintly) 
Take these.

Hey. 
Are you okay? Are you hurt? 
I don’t know what’s wrong with her. 
I don’t know why she was trying to hurt me. 
I know. I know. 
Hey, Abby, listen to me. 
I’ve been an idiot about so many things. 
I’ve been stuck trying to fix the past, but you are the most important thing in the world to me, and I promise you I’m gonna do better. I love you, too, Mike. 
But we should probably go now. 
Right, okay. Come on.

Both. 
(chuckles)

But you were there for me and Abby when it mattered the most. And I don’t think that either of us would be here today if it weren’t for you. 
So… So get better. 
And we’ll be here when you wake up. 
ABBY: 
I did. 
All right, let’s get out of here. 
MIKE: 
ABBY: 
MIKE: 
They’re all alone. 
Right. 
No one takes care of them anymore. 
Can we visit them sometime? 
Um… 
You know what? 
You never know what can happen. 
Do you think if you drink enough milk, you just turn into a cow?
