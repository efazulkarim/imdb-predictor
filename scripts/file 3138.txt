(ominous music)

The truth will be free

Through the mountains I'll

be guided until I do see

I am safe in the arms

of my master, my king

On the last day,

I will follow

My soul I will bring

Whoo!

Temple of the Low God.

(women screaming)

(violent noises)

(Indistinct mumbling)

- You okay, Cap?

- Yeah.

Yeah, I just dozed off.

- Jesus, Hudson,

are you serious?

Nobody wants to see that

sh*t, put on a towel.

- [Hudson] What?

They need to breathe.

- [Officer] You got a Tic Tac

sitting on two acorns, man.

- [Hudson] f*ck you,

are you feeling a little

jealous right now?

- [Officer] You know what?

I'll get you a

pump for Christmas.

(group applauds)

- [Price] Give it up for Cap!

(ominous music)

- [Group] Speech,

speech, speech, speech.

- I don't give speeches

in my underwear.

- Oh, that's never

stopped you before.

You know, three young women

are at home with their family

because of the Cap today.

- It could have been four if

I had called it in sooner,

if I had stopped him before...

- You did stop him, all right?

Come on, Cap.

- Yeah. Take the win.

- Look, you gotta

take them somewhere

'cause you are dog sh*t

at basketball, all right?

- I'll see you tomorrow.

- I'll see you tomorrow, Cap.

- Get dressed pumpkin.

(ominous music)

(Creepy whistling to

the Song of the Low God)

(g*ns firing)

- O'Brien!

- What the f*ck do you want?

- You still mad at me?

- Yeah, I'm f*cking mad at you.

- Come on.

Look, that's never happened

to me before, I swear.

Look, I drank too much.

- I've got one rule,

I don't f*ck dudes that

can't drink as much as me.

And you f*cking snore.

(g*n firing)

- f*ck.

(shotgun cocks)

No, no, wait, wait, wait,

wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

(g*n firing)

(ominous music)

- [Officer] Captain!

(officers yelling)

Officer down!

(officers yelling indistinctly)

- Look at me.

Put the shotgun down

and walk to me, now!

- Tell Jessica and

Diane that I'm sorry.

Tell them I love them.

Tell them I'm safe in the

arms of my master, my...

(g*nsh*t blasts)

- Cap!

Follow me to his kingdom

For my time, it

seems, has come

- As a law enforcement officer,

my duty is to safeguard

the lives and property,

to protect the innocent...

In his grace

I've come to be saved

Wash me clean of

all these wounds

In his arms, I am reborn

Greet me

At the pearly gates

- Tonight's my first shift.

I never thought I'd be

wearing this uniform,

but now it looks

good, don't you think?

Okay, see you later.

(ominous music)

Jesus, Diane, what do you want?

- How about you

answer your phone?

- (sighs) Why?

Nothing's changed, you're drunk,

and I'm still gonna be a

cop, am I missing something?

- I'm not drunk. (laughs)

- Okay.

- Your father used to spend so

much damn time on these toys.

I used to f*cking hate them,

but now I can't seem

to throw them away.

This was his favorite.

- Diane...

Okay, this was nice,

I'll see you later.

- Oh, I'm sorry, baby.

Baby, I'm sorry, I'm

sorry! I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

- Diane, stop, stop, okay?

- Look, you don't

have to do this.

- Why can't you just

be happy for me?

- This isn't you,

you're acting crazy.

- Oh, this is from the woman

who broke my guidance

counselor's arm?

- You don't know what happened.

- [Jessica] That's

what you always say.

- Well, you don't.

- Well, then tell me.

No? Nothing?

Because my father's

in the ground

and I can't seem to

make sense of it.

You may not care, but I

need to know what happened.

- I care, but your

father was no saint.

- No, he wasn't.

He's everything you weren't.

- That's right, I'm no k*ller.

- Bye, Diane.

- Jessica. Please!

(ominous music)

(sirens blaring in distance)

(chattering on radio)

I am safe in the arms

of my master, my king

On the last day,

I will follow

My soul I will bring

(sirens blare)

From the kingdom

of our father

The truth will be freed

Through the mountain, I'll

be guided until I do...

(brakes screech)

- Watch it, piggy.

(flock members laughing)

(ominous music)

(a*t*matic doors open)

(Eerie silence)

- Hello?

Hello?

(clattering)

(ball bouncing)

(man shouting indistinctly)

- f*ck you!

f*ck you!

- Hello?

- How long have you been here?

- I just walked in.

I'm... I'm Officer...

- Turn around!

- I requested this shift.

- [Officer] I said turn around.

Stop!

I said turn around,

not walk away.

- Sir.

I went by the new station,

it looks like they

got their hands full.

- You talking about those

assholes singing on the steps?

Yeah, it's been a year

since we took out that

farm cult pig fucker,

and his loons have managed

to escape jail time

showing their disappointment

with a glorified temper tantrum,

bussing in from all over.

This way, rookie.

You get any curb

creatures doing walk ups,

send them to the new station.

The calls have been rerouted

so it should be quiet

but there's the emergency and

station's numbers on the desk.

My cell, Officer Grip Cohen,

but do not mistake

my willingness

to leave my personal number

as an open invitation

for some girl talk.

You understand?

- Yes, sir. I'm

sure I'll be fine.

- You say you volunteered

for this shift?

- Yes, sir.

- So what is this? You mental?

- No, sir.

I just wanna work

where my father worked

even if it's for one night.

- What'd you say your name was?

- Officer Jessica Loren.

- You're Will Loren's kid?

- Yes, sir.

- You ever see a man die?

- Excuse me, sir.

- You know, stare into his

eyes as the light fades.

That get you off?

- Do you have a problem with me?

- That depends.

- On what?

- It depends on whether or not

you're as f*cked in the

head as your father.

- My father was the best

person I've ever known.

- Your father was a m*rder*r.

He k*lled my friends

then ate his shotgun.

So again, why are you here?

Because I can't come up

with a logical reason

why you would

request this shift.

- I'm not here to excuse

it, I'm just here to work.

So, can I please work?

- If I cared anymore,

I'd call the chief and have

you booted, but I don't.

Stay out of holding.

- as*h*le.

(door creaking)

(ominous music)

(water splashing)

Hello?

(water dripping)

(ball bouncing)

Officer Cohen?

(ball bouncing)

Officer Cohen?

(suspenseful music)

(dramatic music)

(bell ringing)

Sir, are you okay?

- No, I can't. Don't

you think I've looked?

- Sir, do you need

me to help you?

- No!

Where's my baby?

Where's my girl?

Where did you go?

Why did you leave?

- Let me help you, okay?

Let me call a shelter.

Oh, f*ck.

Seriously?

(phone ringing)

Lanford Police Department.

(pig squealing)

Hello.

- [Woman On Phone]

Hello, little piggy.

(phone ringing)

- Lanford Police Department.

- [Woman] Did you know

that the little piggy

that went to the market didn't

go there to buy groceries?

She went there to be groceries.

She was slaughtered.

- Look, I don't have

time for this sh*t.

Prank calling a police

station is illegal

and I can have you arrested,

consider this your warning.

- [Woman] Slaughtered

in cold blood

like the piggies at

your station. (imitates

pig squealing)

- Who is this?

(ominous music)

- [Officer] Lanford

Police Department.

- This is Officer Loren

at the old station.

I'm calling because I

received a prank call

that needs to be traced.

- [Officer] I'm

sorry, who's this?

- Officer Loren.

- [Officer] Any

relation to Will Loren?

- Yes, he was my father.

- [Officer] I'm

sorry to hear that.

- Excuse me?

- [Officer] We got a

lot going on over here

and tracing prank calls

is not at the top

of our priorities.

- Hello?

(g*n firing)

(ominous music)

(ominous music)

- [Cap] Come on,

you're safe now.

We're here to help, come on,

we'll get you home, girls.

Don't worry.

(siren blaring)

(eerie music)

- [Man] Get down

m*therf*cker, don't you move.

You are f*cking dead!

- [Man] We pray in the

Temple of the Low God.

- Please, if anyone's

got any information,

I just want my daughter

back home safe.

(pig snorting)

- [Officer] Lanford

Police Department.

- This is Officer Loren

at the old station.

- [Officer] Officer

Loren, more prank calls?

- No, there's a huge

pig tied up outside.

- [Officer] (laughs) Well,

you don't hear that every day.

- Well, what should

I do with it?

- [Officer] Nothing.

- Just leave it there?

- [Officer] It's probably

safer if you stay inside.

- Mm, yeah, why?

'Cause I'm a woman?

- [Officer] No officer,

I don't know if you

noticed on your way in,

but we had some assholes

causing bullshit on our steps,

well, now they're

doing it all over town

and we're spread a little thin.

So, if they left that

future bacon on your lawn

and something were to

happen, I can't send back up.

Whether or not you have tits

got nothing to do with it.

- Fine.

- [Officer] Look, I'm sorry.

There's a lot going on here

and you're the

closest punching bag.

Leave the pig, we'll

get to it later.

(pig snorting)

(siren wailing in distance)

But I can't remember.

I can't remember.

Where is she?

(taser buzzing)

- Roll over on your stomach.

Roll over.

(man panting)

(pig snorting)

Hands behind your back.

(man grunting)

(eerie music)

Step inside.

- She's here.

- Move.

- My baby.

- I said move.

- No!

She's here.

She's here.

She's here. She's here!

No, no... (sobs)

She's here. She's here.

- All right, well, let's go.

- Shut up! No, no!

No!

- f*ck. Come on.

- No! She's here.

- sh*t, hey, no, no, no.

(banging)

f*ck! Okay...

Dispatch, this is Officer

Loren at the old station.

Officer Loren at the old

station in need of assistance.

- Still here.

No, you tell her.

You tell her.

Daddy didn't do it,

(Jessica gasps)

Let me out, let me out.

(man wailing) She's

someone on my first day.

(Jessica shouting)

- Still here, still here.

- Let me out!

(screaming)

- I will maintain courageous

calm in the face of danger,

scorn, or ridicule,

develop self restraint,

and be constantly mindful of

the wellbeing of others...

The welfare of others.

I will be exemplary

in obeying the laws

and the regulations

of my department.

- [Cohen] Hello?

Hello!

- This is Officer Loren,

sorry to call you so late.

- [Cohen] What is it?

Your "um" better be followed

by the building is on fire

or worse to be

calling at this hour.

- When I first arrived

at the station,

you were yelling at something,

I was curious what it was.

- [Cohen] You were curious

and saw fit to wake me up

in the middle of the night?

- Yes, did did

you see something?

- [Cohen] Right now, I see you

can't handle a simple shift.

You're gonna have to be more-

- Did you see something

that wasn't really there?

- [Cohen] Damn it, did

you go into holding?

- Well, I didn't have a choice.

A homeless man broke

into the station, I...

- [Cohen] Holding is covered

in black mold little girl,

the sh*t is toxic,

makes you hallucinate.

- But I was seeing

things before...

- [Cohen] I told

you stay out of it.

- But sir, I-

- [Cohen] You don't

care to follow orders-

- Yes I do, sir, I do.

- [Cohen] I'll call the station,

have them send over a unit

to pick up that

bum piece of sh*t.

- No sir, You don't

understand, I was-

- [Cohen] You need

me to come over there

and hold your hand

like a little baby

or you gonna shut the

f*ck up and do your job?

- I will do my job.

- [Cohen] And?

- And I will shut the f*ck up.

- [Cohen] Good,

don't call me again.

(pig screeching)

(ominous music)

(siren wailing in distance)

(tires screeching)

- Get out of...

(woman screaming)

- m*therf*cker, f*ck you.

- Hey!

(car engine roaring)

- f*ck you, f*cking as*h*le!

- You all right?

- What?

- This your first day?

- Yeah.

- (chuckles) I figured.

No seasoned cop would

clean me up like this.

My daddy was a cop.

- Really?

Now you?

- I trick to pay the

bills, it's not my job.

- What's your job?

- I work in sanitation.

Some of these f*ckers,

they like to go after kids.

Especially at the truck stops.

Happens more than you

think, a lot more.

So when I see it happen,

I take out the trash.

- So, you do what to them?

Hey.

Hey. (snaps fingers) You there?

- Just drifted

there for a moment.

You here alone.

- Why?

- I wouldn't wanna be here

alone, not after what happened.

- With the officers?

- Well, I don't know

nothing about that.

I mean, what happened

with the mountain flock.

I was there that

night in the next cell

and they were bragging

about what they'd done.

k*lled that girl, and it

wasn't the first time either.

- What night?

- The night they

hung themselves.

- They died in an officer

involved sh**ting.

- Did you see it happen?

- No.

- I bet my tits and a pack

of cigarettes it's the truth.

I saw it when they

were moving me,

had pillowcases over their

heads, blood all over the walls,

blood all over the...

(ominous music)

- What is it?

What's wrong?

- Not gonna say...

anything else...

- What are you looking at?

- Say... anything more...

- Hey!

- From the kingdom of our

father, faithful and true,

our flock we will

follow devoted in you,

on this day in his arms...

...my soul, I will

bring. For the king...

He rejoices, when the dead sing!

- Okay, I'm... I'm gonna

call you an ambulance, okay?

Okay?

(woman screaming)

- Sorry, I just drifted

there for a moment.

- I think it's

time for you to go.

- Okay, okay, okay.

I just, sh*t.

You have a tampon

I could borrow?

Can't earn worth a damn

with my guts spilling out.

- Get out.

- Okay, okay.

(chair clattering)

(phone ringing)

- Lanford Police Department.

- [Woman] Hello, little piggy.

(phone ringing)

- Lanford Police Department.

- [Woman] Hang up again and I

will f*cking k*ll this girl.

You understand?

- What girl?

- [Woman] Oh, I don't know.

It's Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Moe,

catch a hostage by her toe.

Monica Matthews, do

you know that name?

- What kind of game

are you playing?

- Give it a nibble-

(screeching)

- Stop!

- [Woman] Do you know that name?

- Yes, she was one of the

girls my father rescued.

- [Woman] There you

go, that's right.

- What do you want?

- [Woman] It's

not me, it's John.

Trust in his-

- John Malum is dead.

- [Woman] Is he? Did you

ever see a tarantula molt?

Shed the dead baby.

Shed the dead.

- Let me talk to her.

- [Woman] Your daddy started

something very important,

tonight, we're gonna finish it.

(screeching)

- Hello?

- [Officer] Lanford

Police Department.

- They kidnapped

Monica Matthews again.

- [Officer] Who did what?

- The flock, they...

- Hold the line.

Officer, did they

mention anyone else?

- No, well, she

mentioned my father.

- [Officer] So, she

knows who you are?

- She said he started something

that they would finish tonight.

- [Officer] Listen, I

shouldn't tell you this,

but Monica Matthews disappeared

from a party tonight.

Two other girls also

gone missing, Julie

Sims and Anna Cole.

All three girls your

father rescued a year ago.

Look, I'll reach out

to the phone company

and find out where the

call's coming from.

You stay by the line.

(ominous music)

- What did you start, Dad?

(computer chiming)

(women screaming)

- Oh, don't cry little lamb,

your body will rot

like so many before,

but your spirit

will feed the demon.

You'll make it strong

for its long journey.

Oh, I hear can whispers,

they're saying I'm

gonna be the queen.

- Oh, you can't hear sh*t.

- Ow!

- Please, please don't do this.

I can hear them too,

is that what you want?

I can hear the whispers.

(bloody impacts)

- She don't even look

like people anymore.

(eerie music)

Hello?

- [Diane] I know you

think I let you down,

but I was a good mother

when it mattered most.

- I can't do this right now.

- [Diane] Your father

didn't want this for you.

- Seriously, I can't.

- I'm f*cking weak!

- Jesus...

- Okay, eat something,

go to bed, sober up.

(singing from video)

Diane.

Diane!

- [Diane] What are

you listening to?

- It's nothing.

- [Diane] Where the

f*ck are you right now?

- I have to go.

- Turn that sh*t off.

Turn that sh*t off, off.

Turn that sh*t off.

- Stop.

- [Diane] Turn them

off, turn it off.

- Stop.

- Off!

- Jessica.

(eerie music)

(machine whirring)

(machine kicks on)

(Suspenseful music)

(Jessica screaming)

(Jessica screaming)

- Don't go, still here!

- He burns with us, pig!

(eerie music)

- Oh, come on. Pick up.

- [Officer] Lanford

Police Department.

- They chained the doors.

- [Officer] They chained what?

- I'm locked in, I'm

f*cking trapped in here.

- [Officer] You're

gonna be okay,

I'll get a unit over there

ASAP with some bolt cutters.

- Oh, they better come quick

or I'm gonna sh**t a

f*cking window out.

- [Officer] They'll

be there, I promise.

But right now, I need

you to calm down.

- Did John Malum die in here?

- [Officer] Look,

I wasn't there.

I've heard rumors, but

what's the difference?

He's dead.

- I can't, I can't do this.

I can't do this, I thought

I could, but I can't.

I can't breathe,

I can't breathe.

I can't do this

any more, please...

Please, can't you

just get me out?

- [Officer] Officer,

listen, look,

I need you there right now

because there are three girls

missing and you can help.

- I just wanna get out.

- [Officer] This psycho

is only calling you

because she knows

you're Will Loren's kid,

that everybody thinks your

father's a piece of sh*t,

except for those three

girls and their families.

Don't let that be undone.

The calls are coming

from a burner,

we're gonna try

to get a location,

but if she calls you again,

get whatever you can

out of her, okay?

Things are escalating,

they're starting fires.

So, if you smell smoke,

then you can use your firearm

to sh**t out a window.

But right now, I need you there.

- Okay.

- [Officer] sh*t, I

gotta go, sit tight,

help will be there soon.

You picked one hell

of a first shift.

- I will maintain courageous

calm in the face of danger.

To have self restraint,

be constantly mindful

of the welfare of others.

(ominous music)

(feedback screeching)

(phone ringing)

Hello?

(people singing indistinctly)

(static hissing)

And he will come home

(elevator dinging,

starting to move)

Carved of its skin,

and devoured to bone

Call him from the depths

and he will come home

(elevator dings)

(ball bouncing)

(Jessica screaming)

(Jessica panting)

(ominous music)

- It's good to see

you again, Will.

- Shut the f*ck up.

- I'm gonna come back

for you and all you love.

Mark my words.

- We pray in the

Temple of the Low God.

John is... John is its vessel.

Trust in his plan for

you have purpose too.

- You've seen things you

can't begin to explain.

- We pray in the temple

of the low God...

- And now my words have

threatened your family.

- Trust in his plan.

- You must know

if you should pull out your

g*n, blow my brains out...

(g*n cocking)

- For you have purpose too.

- Satan and Christ.

- My father was a minister.

My father was a minister.

My mother a mortuary beautician.

- Just fictions of the church.

- She painted

cadavers like clowns.

When she died, we

had a closed casket.

- Did you know that, Will,

you are important in all this?

In your own little way.

- You smell like egg

covered cat piss.

See, my paw was drenched in

it, and it don't go away.

Gotta cut it out.

- I was never abused

or mistreated.

My childhood was pleasant.

- So, I chopped off his b*lls

and shoved 'em right

down his throat. (laughs)

- Trust in his plan.

- Wibble-wobble,

wibble-wobble, squish, squish.

- You have a purpose too.

You have purpose too.

- Squish, squish.

- We pray in the

Temple of the Low God.

- The devil on my shoulder

just isn't what you think it is.

- My mother wrote me a lullaby,

words were pure and true.

The song of the Low God,

now it's here for you.

My mother wrote me a lullaby,

her words were pure and true,

the song of the Low God,

and now it's here for you.

- The devil on my shoulder just

isn't what you think it is.

- What are you looking at?

- I'm gonna come back

for you and all you love.

The devil on my shoulder just

isn't what you think it is.

(eerie music)

Lullaby, her words

were pure and true.

The song of the Low God!

And now it's here for you!

(wheels rattling)

(ominous music)

(whistling the Song

of the Low God)

(distorted evil sounds)

(Jessica screaming)

Help, help!

- No! Oh!

(violent sounds)

(Jessica panting)

(Jessica screaming)

- Hello? Anybody here?

Whoa, easy rookie.

I called out but I

didn't hear an answer.

There you go.

- Sorry.

- You okay?

- Do I look okay?

- You look stressed.

- Yeah, I guess.

- I'm Price.

- I clipped the last one.

- This fat, pathetic

f*ck is Hudson.

Unfortunately, he's my partner.

- I asked you not

to call me that. Hi.

- Look, we're here for

the guy in holding.

- Great.

- You got the keys?

- Yeah, yeah.

- Whoa, whoa, why

am I grabbing him?

- Because you need

to exercise, as*h*le.

- [Hudson] f*ck you,

I'm going in there.

- You're going in there.

- You're going in there.

- Okay, just give us a sec.

(officers whispering

indistinctly)

- Fine.

Rock, paper, scissor, sh**t.

f*ck! I'll be back.

- Unfortunately, he's

not much to look at,

but he's phenomenal in

bed, so I'll give him that.

They told us Captain

Loren's daughter

would be joining the department.

It's kind of... It's

kind of f*cked up.

Put you in here, it's

kind of funny though.

- I wanted to be here.

- Okay. Well he was a hero

till he wasn't, you know,

kind of fell off the old rocker.

- What happened that day?

- Look, I should probably

go check on Hudson.

- I have a right to know.

- Okay.

If you must know,

it was my fault.

Yeah, he wasn't acting right,

I should have told the

chief, but I didn't.

He kept watching

this interrogation

video over and over

and over, he said

he saw something.

The day before your

father did what he did,

he told me, he said,

"Don't go into holding."

John Malum is still here.

Which reminds me, I

got something to show

you. Come with me.

(eerie music)

- (sighs) Yeah.

We wanted it destroyed with

the rest of the building.

- Is that...

- Yeah.

Don't touch it, okay?

It stays here.

(eerie music)

(g*n firing)

- We devote ourselves to you

as you shall be to us,

faithfully, with great

purpose and ritual.

The Temple Baron will

bring forth the Low God

and I will be redeemer,

king of torment and starless

nights, Infinum Malum.

I baptize thee in my blood,

bound no more to this

flesh, but to another.

(child crying)

You are one of us.

You are one of us, Jessica.

(child crying)

She is one of us!

(Jessica gasping)

- She's one of us, let me out!

Please, she's one of us!

Let me out! Let me out!

You have to let me out!

You have to let me out!

Can you hear them?

- She must be present on

the night of his arrival.

She must summon power.

She must devote herself.

She must participate for

great purpose and ritual.

(pig snorting)

- [Woman] Daddy,

(sobs) I wanna go home.

I just wanna go home.

I'm in here.

- Betty?

- Help me, I wanna go home.

(ghostly moaning)

- [Diane] You've reached Diane,

if I don't care

about you, f*ck off.

- I'm at the old station

where dad worked,

call me as soon as you get this.

(baby cooing)

- Shh. It's okay.

That's my little Jessica.

(pig snorting)

It's gonna be okay.

Daddy's gonna find us.

You don't know your daddy yet,

but he just became

a police officer.

(pig snorting)

He's got a glove on

his belt and a g*n.

And when he gets here,

he'll beat John until

he stops moving.

He'll wanna k*ll him, but he

won't because he's a good man.

But John never forgets,

and he'll find us.

(creature shrieking)

(Jessica screaming)

(screeching)

(tense music)

(screeching)

(screeching)

(screeching)

(screeching)

(g*n firing)

(ominous music)

(bell ringing)

- (banging) Open

the f*cking door.

I thought you were working

at the new station.

Why would you be here?

- You lied to me.

- I lied about a lot of sh*t.

- You wanna narrow that down?

You were one of them.

- How do you know that?

- Oh sh*t,

it's true, isn't it?

- I left your father

after we were pregnant

because John found me.

He just came knocking

on the door and he said,

your baby was gonna be

part of something so big.

I believed him.

After you were

born, I saw things

and I needed to get you as far

away from them as possible.

Your daddy saved us.

We ran, we left

our lives behind,

but a year ago, he found us.

(John laughing)

John hadn't aged a day,

it was like staring

at a bad memory.

He wanted us back, baby.

Will stopped him,

but John had plans.

He always does.

- What was I meant

to be part of?

- [Voice] Diane.

- Answer me, where

are you going? Diane?

- [Voice] Diane. Diane.

- Diane, what are you doing?

Mom.

(woman shouting in distance)

Lock the door, stay here.

(woman screaming)

This is Officer Loren, I

need f*cking backup now.

- Please, help me.

- Holster, your p*stol.

- Put the g*n down.

- Holster,

your f*cking p*stol.

- Put the g*n down.

- Do it or I'll k*ll her.

- Put it down!

- Holster your p*stol now!

- Okay, okay.

Where are the other girls?

- It's your night and

that's all you have to ask?

You're crazy, just

like your mother.

- Let her go, I already

requested backup.

- Nobody's coming,

you're on your own.

- What do you want?

It's not what I want,

it's what he wants.

And he wants you.

- Well, I'm right here

c**t, come and get me.

- Patience piggy,

your time will come.

The Low God's been

whispering in John's ear

ever since you were

in your mama's belly.

And he knew you would

come back to him.

You know, I'd hoped I'd

be the one by his side.

But I know what I'm here for,

I have a message for you.

You see, you need

power for this ritual

and there there is

power in spilling blood.

- Please.

- An animal will give you some.

- Don't you f*cking touch her.

- But a human will

give you more.

(g*nshots firing)

- I'm gonna get you little

piggy! I'm coming to get you!

(people shouting)

- Mom?

Mom?

Mom!

(phone ringing)

Hello?

- Good, good, you're okay.

Listen, we think the

flock is planning a raid

on the old station.

- They're here.

- [Officer] f*ck,

f*ck, all right,

we'll get you out of there.

Is your mother safe?

- I can't find her.

I can't, I can't...

How do you know

my mother's here?

- Oh, well, I always

keep tabs on her.

She was one of my

favorite jewels,

as devoted as they come.

Pure fire.

- Who is this?

- [Man On Phone] I told your

daddy that I'd come back

for all he loved.

- Where the f*ck is my mother?

- [Man On Phone] A vessel must

be chosen by its passenger.

I was chosen when I was a boy

and tonight, the Low

God finally comes.

(tense music)

(Jessica shrieks)

What are you doing back

here? Where's my mother?

(distorted shouting)

(Jessica screaming)

(g*ns firing)

(Jessica panting)

(banging)

(people shouting)

This is officer Loren

at the old station

in need of assistance.

(people shouting)

I repeat, officer in need

of f*cking assistance.

(static hissing)

Dedicated towards...

I will constantly strive

to achieve... Oh...

- [Male Voice] We're gonna

find you, pretty little pig.

- [Female Voice]

Come out and find us.

(Footsteps approaching)

(ominous music)

- I hear you.

(banging)

(screeching)

(g*n firing)

Kingdom of our father,

faithful and true

Our flock, we will follow

Devoted in you

On this day, in his arms,

my soul I will bring

For the king, he rejoices

when the dead sing

(ominous music)

- Super cops saves the day.

(both laughing)

Rock, paper, scissors. sh**t.

(laughs) No, just kidding.

Come in here, come on.

We wanna show you something.

- Yeah, we want to

show you something.

(both laughing)

(woman wailing)

- Stop, stop!

(g*n firing)

(g*n firing, violent sounds)

I'm here, hold on,

you're okay. It's okay.

(woman gagging)

Please, please stay with me.

Please.

Please.

(door clicking)

(ominous music)

Dad?

- [Will] You don't

belong in that uniform.

- I needed to know, why?

How could you hurt

all those people?

- [Will] I didn't hurt

anybody, baby. I k*lled them.

- You hurt mom, you hurt me.

- I'm a cop, Jessica,

that's what cops do.

We hurt people, k*ll

them when we have to.

And that day...

- (demonic) I had to.

(g*nshots firing)

(screeching)

(g*n firing)

Rise, rise,

inhuman dark king

In your forgotten tongue,

we'll learn to sing

To live immortal

forever and true

My spirit, my body,

I give it to you

(woman gasping)

I got you.

- Thank you.

(woman gasping)

bones breaking)

(ominous music)

Strive to achieve...

To achieve, strive to achieve

those ideals before God.

(Jessica shouting)

- [Diane] Jessica! Jessica help!

- [Woman] The Temple

Baron approaches.

He is the harbinger!

(man screaming)

(woman laughing)

Hi, pretty little pig.

Come out and find us.

(ominous music)

He burns with us!

They burn with us!

- The Low God.

(woman laughing)

- [Woman] He burns with us, pig!

- Put her in the chair.

Feed her to the f*cking pig!

We pray to the Low God.

Tonight he finally comes!

Daddy plays the bathtub game

Pulls the soap from the dish

Wibble-wobble, wibble-wobble

Squish, squish

Mommy cries in the hall

And I wiggle like a fish

- She must be present on

the night of his arrival.

Squish, squish

- She must summon power.

Spit on his lips

- We feast on angel's wings.

- She must devote herself...

- And drink from devil's horns.

- She must participate for

great purpose and ritual.

- They cower like

dull, mindless beasts.

Rise. Rise, inhuman dark king.

In your forgotten tongue,

we'll learn to sing,

to live immortal

forever and true.

My spirit, my body,

I give it to you.

She is one of us.

feed the demon.

Your spirit will feed the demon.

Your spirit will feed the demon.

- The Temple Baron

brought forth the Low God

(distorted shouting)

(g*n firing)

King of torment and

starless nights.

But he chose you too,

Jessica, for great purpose

and ritual

(distorted shouting)

(g*n firing)

He sent me to find you

before you even existed.

(demon screeching)

Queen of sunless dawns.

(tense music)

- Jessica.

- Oh my God!

Mom! Mom!

No...

Oh my God. Mom, I'm

As a law enforcement officer,

my duty is to safeguard

lives and property,

to protect my master.

My...

(g*n firing)

(people applauding)

(people cheering)

- The world is such

a game, so small,

but there must be

gains on this board.

They must bear fruit.

You have your pawns,

and I have mine.

But I know your every

move, all your fears,

all your escapes,

all for nothing.

'Cause in the end,

I'll capture my queen,

and our union will strip the

veil and call upon the others.

Mark my words.

(crickets chirping)

(fire crackling)

(Jessica screaming)

(ominous music)

From the kingdom

of our father

The truth will be free

Through the mountain,

I'll be guided

Until I do see

I am safe in the arms

of my master, my king

On the last day,

I will follow

My soul, I will bring

Rise, rise,

inhuman dark king

In your forgotten tongue,

we'll learn to sing

To live immortal

forever and true

My life, my body,

I give it to you
