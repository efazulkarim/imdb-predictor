[PHONE RINGING] 
Devin. 
DEVIN: 
Is this fucking Tracy? 
No, it's Jill. 
Well... [SCOFFS] 
...is Heather there? 
No, I'm not with her 
right now. 
Why do you have her phone 
if you're not with her? 
What are you calling about, 
Devin? 
Just tell her 
I know what's up. 
- You know what's up? 
- That's right. 
And tell her to fuck off, 
and I'm going to 
fucking murder her. 
Okay, Devin. 
Good bye. 
HEATHER: 
Who was that? 
- Did you go in already? 
- I didn't go in yet. 
- Who was that? 
- Uh, Devin. 
He says 
he knows what's up, 
and he's gonna 
fucking murder you. 
Why haven't you 
gone in yet? 
[SIGHS] 
I want you 
to come in with me. 
JILL: 
Okay, 
you're gonna kill me. 
Page 2/44
No, I'm not. 
Wait, 
what are you gonna do 
that's gonna make me 
wanna kill you? 
I'm not gonna do 
the movie. 
What do you mean, 
you're not gonna do the movie? 
I'm gonna go in there and I'm gonna tell him I don't wanna do it... 
and I think 
it'd be really nice 
if you came in with me 
for support. 
- Okay. You know he's gonna freak out, right? - Yeah, I know that. 
And Jamie is similarly 
going to freak out. 
Fuck Jamie. 
I don't care about Jamie. 
Okay. I-I... Why? 
Why aren't you 
doing the movie? 
I don't wanna do anything 
for a while. 
I think that you should 
think about this. 
Jill, 
I've thought about this. 
Okay. This is 
a really big decision. 
And, you know, 
there's no movie without you. 
- Right? 
- Of course I know that. 
I know 
this is a big deal. 
Okay. 
Okay. 
- Mm. 
- Okay. 
[EXHALES SHARPLY] 
Jill.

What? 
[SOFT MUSIC PLAYS] 
[INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] 
Good evening. 
Are you looking for someone? 
Uh, I am, 
but I just found him. 
- Thank you. 
- Okay, great. 
[INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] 
- Hi, Jill. 
- Hey, Greg. 
Where the fuck 
is Heather? 
- Uh, she's not coming. 
- [CHUCKLES] Okay. 
I know you just didn't tell me 
that she's not coming, 
- because we have a ton of shit to talk about. - I know. 
And I've been here 
for like, half an hour, 
so I know you didn't just tell me 
that she's not fucking coming. 
And for that matter, what are 
you doing here in person 
if she's not even coming? 
Can I get you guys started 
with some apps? 
- Apps? 
- Apps. Appetizers. 
Have you looked them over? 
If not, I can recommend 
something or give you more time. 
Whatever you'd like. 
Yeah, I think 
we're just drinking. 
ANDREA: 
Okay. That sounds great. 
What would you 
like to drink? 
Uh, well, actually, 
he's just drinking. 
Page 4/44
If it's okay for now, 
I'm just here. 
- Great. That's no problem. 
- Okay. 
You know what? 
I am... I'm gonna have apps. 
I'm gonna have 
one of everything. 
ANDREA: 
One of everything? 
That's actually 
a lot of food. 
- I will have one of every single app, yeah. - Okay. 
Well our bruschetta 
usually comes in pairs, 
but do you just want one? 
- No, I'll have the pair. 
- Okay. That's perfect. 
I'll get your order in 
right away. 
Thank you. 
GREG: 
Greg. 
You wanna tell me 
what you're doing here? 
She's not doing the movie. 
Okay. 
Greg! 
[GROANS] 
How'd it go? 
Oh, um, I dunno. 
I think it went bad. 
- It went bad? 
- Mm-hmm. I think so. 
What is this? 
That is an old-fashioned 
that Greg was drinking. 
[CELLPHONE BUZZING] 
Should I answer? 
[EXHALES DEEPLY] 
- That was fast. 
Page 5/44
- Should I answer? 
- Yeah, answer. 
- Are you here? 
Jamie. 
JAMIE: 
Are you kidding me? 
- I don't know what you're talking about. - You know exactly what. 
Is she with you? 
Jamie, it's okay. 
What... What do you mean, 
"It's okay"? 
You know what? 
We're in a restaurant 
right now. 
I'll come in tomorrow 
and we'll talk about it, okay? 
Heather, 
I wanna kill you right now. 
Don't be so harsh. 
I'm not being harsh. 
You are being crazy. 
Do you know 
how much this fucks me, 
how much it fucks 
all of us? 
Jamie, 
I'm gonna go now, okay? 
Put Jill back on! 
N... Okay. 
You know what? 
I'll step outside, 
and we'll talk. 
Well? 
Hey. 
Uh, sorry to bother you. 
I'm Sierra. 
I'm a big fan of Heather's. 
Oh. 
You're her assistant, 
right? 
Uh... 
Eh... Yes. 
Page 6/44
You don't have to worry. 
I'm... I'm not gonna 
bother you guys. 
I just... 
I had to come up and say hello. Okay, I'm really sorry, 
but, uh, 
you really shouldn't be here 
- when she gets back. 
- No-no-no, I totally understand, but it would be really cool 
if I could just hang out here 
for a minute. 
Hello. 
Hi. 
SIERRA: 
tried to save you, 
but I've just wanted 
to meet you for so long 
that I wouldn't take no 
for an answer. 
I have to tell, 
you... you're even 
more beautiful in person. 
Thank you. 
I'm sure the two of you 
just wanna hang out on your own. Um, just seriously, 
it would mean so much to me 
if I could just 
hang out here for a minute. 
Okay. 
Oh. 
Oh, thank you. 
Actually, 
could we take a picture? 
I would love it 
if we could take 
a picture together. 
Uh, no. 
Now is not a good time 
for photos. 
I'm sorry. 
Page 7/44
It's fine. 
We can take a photo. 
Okay. 
Would you mind? 
Uh, okay. 
[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] 
All right. 
Can you do one 
without the flash, actually? 
We got the photo. 
No, it's okay. 
Let's do it again. 
Do you know 
how to turn the flash off? 
Yes, I know 
how to turn the flash off. 
- Oh. 
- Okay. 
- [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] 
- Great. 
- Did it turn out okay? 
- Yeah, they're both great. 
I feel like the first one 
was better. 
No. 
They're really both good. 
- Can I ask you a question? 
- Mm-hmm. 
Sorry, I'm just... 
[CHUCKLES] Aah! 
...really nervous. 
- It's totally fine. 
- Um... [CLEARS THROAT] Okay. 
So, um, 
as you probably know... 
most of information 
about you 
- is on the Internet, or whatever. - Mm-hmm. 
Um, it's just that there's 
this theory going around 
that the two of you 
are together, 
and that's why you're 
Page 8/44
breaking up with Devin. 
And, I just wanted to know 
if it was true. 
I'm sorry, 
that's just... 
that's incredibly 
inappropriate. 
Oh, I... 
I didn't mean to be rude. 
ANDREA: 
Okay, here we go. 
What is this? 
It's apps. 
Apps? 
Appetizers. 
They're super-good. 
- MAN #1: 
- MAN #2: 
- Hey, Heather. 
- Heather, here we go! 
- Oh! 
- Here we go, here we go. 
STAN: 
how ya doin' tonight? 
- You're looking beautiful. 
- Okay, Stan, give us some space. 
STAN: 
now that Devin's out of it? 
Hey, Heather, come on, 
we know you like to dish. 
- Tell us, what's going on? 
- HEATHER: 
So you're a single lady, 
then? 
Yup, I'm a single lady. 
MAN #1: 
Come on, Heather! 
Page 9/44
STAN: 
Wait up, come on. 
Hey, Heather, why don't you 
let me take you out some time? I'll take ya any place 
you wanna go. 
- No thanks, Stan. 
- No thanks, really? 
Well, what is it? What does 
Tracy have that I don't have? 
Oh! Look at that? I think 
I'm onto something, there. 
Well, Tracy Kim is 
a very beautiful woman. 
- JILL: 
- What do you think? 
I don't know 
what you're talking about. 
Okay, remember, 
I can either work with you 
- or I can work... 
- What is that supposed to mean? - Are you threatening us? 
- No, I'm not threatening you. Okay, are you gonna print 
a bunch of bullshit rumors? 
No, I'm not gonna print 
a bunch of bullshit rumors. 
What is your problem? 
Get a fucking life. 
- What's my problem? 
- Get in the car. Come on. 
I just feel that Heather's 
fans have a right to know. 
HEATHER: 
A vulture. 
No. Listen. 
I'm not a fucking vulture. 
- Move your coat. 
- I'm not the bad guy here. 
Page 10/44
STAN: 
Remember that. 
Who's the boss? 
Who's running this show? 
There ya go. 
Bye-bye. 
Have a good night. 
[SCOFFS] 
JILL: 
- I'm looking at Instagram. 
- No! 
- I know, but I... 
- Stop! Don't do that! 
I just wanna see the photo 
that that girl took of me. 
I found it. 
You already found it? 
Okay. 
I do not look good. 
Don't show me 
while I'm driving. 
- I would say I look bad to quite bad. - Okay. 
Heather, 
where are we going? 
"O.M.G., it happened. 
Heather Anderson, 
heart-eye emoticon." 
"Hashtag Heather Anderson. 
Hashtag Heather Anderson OMG." "Hashtag heart Heather." 
That is so many hashtags. 
All right, Heather, 
stop looking at things 
on Instagram, 
put your phone away, 
and tell me where we're going. - Just keep on going west. 
- Okay. 
Actually, can we just stop 
by your place for a minute? 
My place? Why? 
'Cause there's just something 
Page 11/44
there I wanna pick up. 
What? 
Look, if I tell you what it is, 
you won't let us stop. 
- What are you talking about? 
- I just wanna stop at your place for a minute. Can we stop at your place 
for a minute, please? 
Do you have alcohol 
at your place? 
I have St-Germain. 
- From that party? 
- Yeah. 
- That's all you have? 
- That's all I have. 
- [LAUGHS] - Why can't you 
be normal and have vodka? 
[EXHALES DEEPLY] 
[GROANS] 
- Comfy? 
- This couch is really fucking comfortable. I know. It should be. 
- You gave it to me. 
- I did? 
- Mm-hmm. 
- When? 
What do you need 
in this apartment? 
A drink. Please? 
Okay, drinks first. 
Drinks, drinks, drinks! 
[REFRIGERATOR DOOR OPENS] 
- Ah, the only mixer I have is pineapple juice. - Ew. 
Ooh, I actually have 
a Mello Yello. 
Ooh! 
Why do you have a copy 
of Seventeen Magazine? 
I don't know. 
It just started coming. 
That's weird. 
I know, 
it's really, really weird. 
Page 12/44
- It's actually really cool. 
- Really? 
Yeah. It looks exactly 
like it did in the '90s. 
I don't think 
I really read it in the '90s. 
Oh, my God, I was obsessed 
with these things. 
The quizzes, 
do you remember the quizzes? 
I guess maybe I did 
a quiz or two in my day. 
Remember 
Jonathan Taylor Thomas? 
Yeah. 
I definitely had my first orgasm thinking about him. 
- What? 
- What? 
[BOTH LAUGH] 
HEATHER: 
I'm into this. 
Here. 
Thank you. 
- This is delicious. 
- It's delightful. 
I love it. 
We can't forget 
this combination. 
Okay, well there's two of us 
to remember, so... 
Yeah, but you're the one 
who remembers things. 
Why are we here? 
Right. [CLEARS THROAT] 
Okay. 
A question for the lady. 
All right, milady. 
[LAUGHS] What? 
Um... 
You have a gun, right? 
No. 
Okay, 
Page 13/44
I've seen your gun. 
I stole a hair tie from you once and I saw it. 
It's in your bathroom. 
- Okay, yes, I have a gun. 
- Okay. 
Why do you have a gun? 
I don't keep it loaded 
or anything. 
- I just... 
- Where'd you get the gun? 
I got it when we were 
shooting in Utah. 
What? 
I know it's stupid, 
but I felt really not safe 
where we were, 
and, um, 
the props guy, Dave... 
- The one who had a crush on you? - Yeah. 
He gave it to me. 
Wait, so is it a real gun 
or a prop gun? 
No, it's a real gun. 
- It's a real gun. 
- Yeah. 
Can I borrow it? 
- What are you gonna do? 
- I... I'm... Nothing. 
I just... I feel like 
there's so many crazy people 
who are mad at me right now, 
you know? 
- Yeah... 
- And... Okay. 
You know how you were just 
saying you don't feel safe? 
Yeah... 
I feel like that 
all the time. 
[GUN CLICKS] 
You know 
how to shoot a gun? 
Page 14/44
- Jill, how many movies have I shot guns in? - Two. 
Well, yeah, 
I know how they work. 
Okay, more importantly, 
do you know 
how to not shoot a gun? 
Like, how to not shoot yourself 
or anyone else 
- when you don't mean to? 
- Yes. 
- I do. 
- [SIGHS] 
I'm not gonna use it. 
I'm 99.99% 
not gonna use it. 
Okay. Good. 
Thank you. 
I wanna do karaoke. 
Now? 
Yeah, like fucking 
real, hardcore 
K-town karaoke. 
I'll call Tracy, 
and we'll do 
a three-person party. 
[ENGINE REVS IN DISTANCE] 
You guys are okay, right? 
Yeah, we're good. 
We're good, right? 
Yeah. 
Yeah, we're good. 
[CHUCKLES] 
Hi. 
I'm going to the cabin 
tomorrow. 
I'll miss you. 
- I'll see you this weekend, right? - Yeah. 
Mm. 
[KNOCKS ON GLASS] 
Yes? 
Someone just took a photo 
of me and Tracy. 
Page 15/44
What? 
I saw a flash. 
Uh... 
did you see who took it? 
No, I saw a flash. 
[SIGHS] 
Well, um... 
I guess 
there's nothing more 
we can really do 
about that now. 
It's probably fucking Stan. 
Oh, Stan. 
Starfish-man. 
Stanny the manny. 
Are you okay to drive? 
When a problem comes along, 
you must whip it 
What? 
Hey, sleepyhead, 
no sleeping! 
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry! I'm sorry. - Wake up, wake up, wake up! 
- You like Tracy, right? 
- Yeah. 
Are you kidding? 
I love Tracy. 
- She let me ride her bike. 
- Her motorcycle? 
- Yeah. 
- Are you serious? 
Yeah, well, 
when I had to pick up 
all that stuff last week, 
she let me ride it. 
She never lets me ride it. 
Well, I used to have one 
in boarding school. 
- Really? 
- Mm-hmm. 
Got it from a local kid 
and I hid it in the woods. 
What a delinquent. 
- Hey, but, I mean... 
Page 16/44
- What? What? 
Well, I told you 
what I think of Tracy, 
but what about you? 
Do you love Tracy? 
[CLEARS THROAT] 
I like Tracy. 
- I like her a lot. 
- [LAUGHS] 
That's good. 
- That's really good. 
- Yeah. 
I'm going to her cabin 
this weekend. 
- Oo-la-la. 
- Oo-la-la! 
Okay, eyes on the road. 
No crashes. 
I'm... Okay, I looked at you 
for like two seconds. 
Yeah, whatever. 
You are not the best driver. 
[LAUGHS] No, I'm not. 
I'm terrible. 
Yeah, you are terrible. 
[DOOR CLOSES] 
Do you want a drink? 
JILL: 
[NORMAL VOICE] 
You wanna stay here tonight? 
[NORMAL VOICE] If that's 
all right with you. 
- Yeah. I'll make up the guest room. - No, no, no. 
I have to get up early 
and go home and change 
before the thing. 
And if I sleep 
in a real bed, 
I won't be able to do it. 
But the sleep 
will be so much better. 
Doesn't matter. 
Page 17/44
Won't be able to get up. 
[WATCH BEEPING] 
What are you doing? 
I'm setting an alarm. 
Wait. 
Why do you have to get up? 
Because I set up the meeting 
about that other thing. 
What other thing? 
The reshoots 
that you're not doing. 
I totally forgot 
about that. 
I know. 
[LIGHT CLICKS] 
Jill. 
What? 
The light came on outside. 
Hmm? 
The light... 
motion sensor light... 
came on outside. 
Oh. 
It's probably just 
a coyote or something. 
We'll be fine. 
[EXHALES DEEPLY] 
[TAPPING FEET ON FLOOR] 
- What is that? 
- I don't know. 
[LAUGHS] 
You have to protect me. 
I can protect you 
in my sleep. 
No. You have to protect me 
in real life. 
I can protect you 
with my eyes closed. 
[BOTH LAUGH] 
Have you seen "Scream" 
anytime lately? 
Go to sleep. 
You know, I haven't forgotten 
what we talked about. 
Page 18/44
When? 
Of doing something together, 
on our own. 
Developing projects 
or something like that. 
I didn't forget. 
I know. 
[INHALES DEEPLY] 
I love you. 
I love you, too. 
[WATCH ALARM BEEPING] 
JILL: 
[GUNSHOT, GLASS SHATTERS] 
Shit. 
[BREATHING SHALLOWLY] 
Oh... 
What happened? 
I'm sorry. 
- I'm so fuckin' sorry. 
- Christ, are you okay? 
Yeah, yeah, no, I'm fine. 
I just... I... 
- The gun went off. 
- The gun went off? 
I was... 
I was thinking about taking it. 
- Why? You were gonna take it? 
- I was gonna take it, 
and then I decided not to... 
and I was putting it back, 
- and then I really don't know what happened. - It's okay. It's okay. 
You're okay. It's okay. 
- I'm really sorry. 
- It's okay. 
I broke Devin's coin case. 
It's okay. 
I hate that stupid 
fucking coin case. 
[SIGHS] 
[SIGHS] Okay. 
Now go tell them I don't wanna 
do their shitty reshoots. 
Page 19/44
[SNIFFS] 
HEATHER: 
Hi. It's Heather. 
I'll call you back. 
Bye. 
JILL: 
to sort this shit out with you. And you better have 
fucking coffee. 
Bye. 
Hello? 
Heather? 
Heather. 
Heather. 
[SCREAMS] 
[BREATHING SHALLOWLY] 
AHN: 
I'm Edward Ahn. 
I'm the detective 
in charge of the case. 
Mind if I sit down? 
Okay. 
Look, I... 
I know this isn't easy. 
You won't believe me, 
but I've felt like 
you're feeling right now. 
I've felt it and... 
I know there isn't much 
a stranger like me can say 
in a situation like this. 
Which is why it's so tough 
for me to ask you 
what I've gotta ask you. 
What do you have to ask me? 
[TEA KETTLE WHISTLES] 
I can tell you're smart. 
You remember things. 
Am I right? 
I don't know. 
I think you might 
Page 20/44
remember things 
more than most people. 
It's just a gut feeling 
I have. 
I already gave a statement. 
You did. 
Um, but not to a detective. 
Um, that was more of 
a paperwork statement, 
basic facts. 
See, what I'm looking for 
is a little different. 
I want you to think back 
to early this morning. 
And what I wanna know about 
is what is the last thing 
you saw in this house. 
In other words, 
what was Heather doing 
when you walked out the door 
the last time you saw her? 
She was just looking, 
at me. 
That's it? 
Just looking? 
Yeah, 
just normal looking. 
Mm. 
Except she was holding 
your .22 snubnose. 
Is that right? 
Yeah. 
So, we could say 
it was a little 
not quite normal, right? 
Well, 
the looking was normal. 
It's just that she was... 
she was holding the gun. 
Okay. 
She was holding the gun 
and looking normal. 
Is that right? 
Yeah. 
Page 21/44
Did she ever 
threaten you or...? 
No, 
she didn't threaten me. 
'Cause I've heard stories 
about movie stars that... 
Just trying to construct 
a little history. 
That's all. 
You might not think 
something's important, 
and then bingo, 
it's the key 
to the whole thing.

BREATHES SHALLOWLY] 
[PHONE RINGING] 
[EXHALES SHARPLY, 
BREATHES SHALLOWLY] 
[PHONE RINGING] 
Hi. It's Tracy. 
I can't pick up the phone 
right now. 
Leave a message 
and I'll call you back. 
Hey, Tracy. 
Um... 
Just call me back 
when you can, okay? 
Okay? 
[WAVES CRASHING] 
[PHONE RINGING] 
RECEPTIONIST: 
Finnegan, Harper and Murphy. 
It's Jill. 
Put me through to Jamie. 
Did she kill herself? 
No. 
She didn't kill herself. 
How do you know? 
Because, Jamie, 
Page 22/44
she was shot five times. 
Have you been 
to the police yet? 
Yeah. 
I think they think 
I did it. 
You... you didn't? 
Of course I didn't! 
And I'm pretty sure 
you didn't. 
[CELLPHONE RINGS] 
Hello. 
Hello. 
Do you have a charger? 
No. 
You have to put out 
a press release 
before the police do it. 
We have to stay 
on top of this. 
I can't. 
Jamie, come on. 
I know you don't wanna 
think about this right now 
but you have to think about this right now. 
Because what we say 
and do right now, 
that's what people are gonna 
remember about this. 
Jamie, I can't do it. 
I literally can't do it. 
Okay, fine. 
I'll take care of it. 
Jill, 
if she didn't kill herself, 
who killed her? 
I don't know. 
I really can't think 
about this right now. 
Honestly, 
my money's on Greg. 
You should've heard 
what he said to me 
Page 23/44
last night. 
What did he say to you 
last night? 
Something to the effect of, 
"Jamie, this is killing me." 
"I'm going to fucking 
kill Heather. 
I am going to fucking 
kill her." 
I'm sure 
he was exaggerating. 
Well, I don't know, 
but I wouldn't be so quick 
to cross people off the list. 
I didn't kill her, 
but you don't know that. 
You see what I mean? 
I guess. 
Look. 
I know you and I 
kind of hate each other, 
but I actually 
quite like you. 
So I'm asking you 
to be careful, okay? 
[POLICE RADIO CHATTER] 
- Goin' somewhere? 
- Aah! 
Uh, me? 
No. 
AHN: 
[SOFT MUSIC PLAYS] 
Have a seat 
at the counter. 
JILL: 
THIRI: 
What can I get you? 
- You want a coffee? 
- No, thanks. 
Two coffees, 
regular coffees. 
Page 24/44
Okay. 
You didn't answer my call. 
My phone died. 
Where are you from, 
originally? 
I don't think 
that that's important. 
I'm not asking 
'cause it's important. 
I just wanna know. 
Portland. 
I'm from Portland. 
- Oregon or Maine? 
- Oregon. 
I haven't lived there 
since I was 14, though. 
Why not? 
Because I went 
to boarding school. 
Which one? 
Um, Exeter. 
You always want to be 
somebody's assistant? 
I mean, back then, 
you know, back at Exeter, 
what did you wanna be? 
I don't see what this all 
has to do with Heather. 
I'm gonna tell you 
three things. 
Okay? 
All right. 
Drink your coffee. 
I don't want it. 
I said I didn't want it. 
Okay, look, 
do whatever makes you happy, 
but just listen 
for a couple of minutes. 
Can you do that? 
Yes. 
All right. 
Look, I already know how 
you're gonna say 
Page 25/44
these things 
fit with your story, 
but here we go anyway. 
Number one, your prints 
and your prints alone 
were on the shell casings. 
The .22 had 
one other set of prints. 
Heather's. 
That's it. 
No other prints. 
You with me so far? 
- I think so. 
- Good. 
Number two, 
your hand tested positive 
for gunshot residue 
underneath the right index 
and middle fingernails. 
I told you. 
I accidentally let off 
a shot this morning. 
Okay, number three, 
by your own admission, 
you were there at approximately the time of death. 
'Course there's 
a couple of things 
I still can't figure. 
Like what? 
Like the coins. 
The coins? 
What about them? 
They're gone. 
I can't figure it. 
Unless it's somebody's 
clumsy attempt 
to make the whole thing 
look like 
a burglary gone wrong. 
Am I under arrest? 
Not yet. 
Warrant's coming, though. 
What? What are you... 
Page 26/44
What are you looking at? 
Stan. 
You know this guy? 
Hey, Jill. 
Yeah, he's paparazzi. 
You can't do that. 
In the State of California, 
you cannot record 
a private conversation 
without the consent 
of all parties 
in that conversation. 
I'm sure you know that. 
[LAUGHS] 
Hey, Detective. 
Yes? 
What happened 
to your friend? 
Yeah, can I help you? 
Oh, my God, it's you. 
- Yeah. 
- What, uh... 
What is this? 
What are you supposed to be? 
- Nothing. 
- Okay. 
I do think the police 
are looking for you. 
So you've heard? 
Oh, yeah, I heard. 
Can I come in? 
Why? 
Because I wanna 
talk to you. 
Okay, fine. 
[DOOR CLOSES] 
You're gonna have to talk 
while I pack. 
Pack? 
Where are you going? 
Goin' to Edinborough. 
What's in Edinborough? 
Well, for me, nothing. 
That's the point. 
Page 27/44
I don't get it. 
Look, 'cause of 
your snake of a boss, 
there's no more movie. 
I gotta get outta 
this poisonous town 
before I murder someone. 
You didn't already, 
did you? 
You're being glib. 
It's not attractive, 
and frankly, I'm offended 
by the question. 
- Well, somebody killed her. 
- Yeah, you know what? 
I really 
don't give a shit. 
- Greg, she's dead! 
- Yeah. 
She's still a fuckin' snake, 
and I still 
don't give a shit. 
You used to like her. 
Yeah, well, that's before 
she snaked me. 
You know how long I've been 
working on this movie? 
5 years. 
You've told me 100 times. 
Anyway, she was going 
through a hard time. 
It had nothing to 
do with you. 
And who cares, 
'cause she's dead! 
Okay. 
Jesus Christ, I get it. 
You made your point. 
Don't you think it looks 
a little weird 
that you're 
leaving town? 
No. Why? 
I mean, I think the police 
Page 28/44
think you did it, so... 
Have they been here? 
Yeah, 'bout an hour ago. 
I answered 
all their questions. 
They didn't tell you 
to stay around 
- or anything like that? 
- Nope. 
GREG: 
I should bring to read? 
I don't know 
what books you own. 
Well, 
clearly something escapist. 
Do you know anything about, uh, nautical fiction? 
No. 
You don't think I killed her, 
do you? 
You two were like freaky, 
fucked up best friends. 
People like that 
kill each other all the time. 
Where were you 
at 6: 
I was probably crying 
or jerkin' off. 
Can you be serious 
for five seconds? 
I didn't kill her. 
Okay? 
She's still a fuckin' snake, 
but I didn't kill her. 
And I would never kill her, 
no matter how angry 
I was at her. 
Okay? 
Who killed her, Greg? 
Isn't it obvious? 
Is it? 
Okay, look. 
Page 29/44
I don't wanna speculate, 
but if I'm writing 
the screenplay, 
I'm looking 
for three things... 
motive, opportunity, 
capacity, okay? 
The cops think you did it 
because of opportunity 
and physical evidence, 
but forget about that 
for a second. 
If I'm writing it, 
it's obviously Devin. 
Right? I mean, motive... 
he hates her. 
Opportunity... 
she lives in a house 
that he basically owns. 
And capacity... 
this is Devin 
we're talking about. 
The guy's a fuckin' maniac. 
Which is exactly why 
it's not Devin. 
Because it's too obvious. 
You know, 
all signs point to Devin, 
so it can't be him. 
You know, maybe it's... 
maybe it's Jamie, 
or maybe it's me. 
But it's not Devin. 
- You know this is real life, right? - [SCOFFS] 
Yeah, look, uh, I'm just 
trying to help ya, here. 
Okay? 
I mean, I'll tell ya 
what the real twist would be, 
is if it was you. 
But, could also just be 
some random lunatic, you know, like a fuckin' crazy superfan 
Page 30/44
or something. 
You know, 
I heard that one time. 
There was a guy living 
in Katy Perry's garage 
for like a week. 
Can you imagine that? 
- What? 
- The fucking superfan. 
What? 
This crazy 
fucking superfan... 
she came up to us last night 
after you stormed out. 
Stop. Stop, stop, stop. 
You say that Heather 
was at the restaurant 
last night? 
Well, 
she was just outside. 
Greg. 
Of course she was watching. 
She's such a fucking pussy. 
It's like 
she was actually there, 
and she still sent you in 
to do the dirty work. 
Can I please tell you 
about the superfan? 
- All right. Fine. 
- Okay. 
After you left Casa Bianca, 
she came up to us, 
and she was acting all crazy, 
like obsessive. 
Obsessive how? 
Well, she was asking 
all these personal questions, 
and she wanted to take 
a bunch of pictures. 
- That's it? 
- [SIGHS] 
- Yeah, that's it. 
- Wait. Just... 
Page 31/44
Just forget the whole crazy 
superfan thing. 
I'm sorry I brought it up. 
All right? 
Could've been Stan. 
Who's Stan? 
This terrible 
paparazzi guy. 
Yeah. 
What? 
Okay, look, um, 
just 'cause I gotta leave 
in like five minutes, 
and for some fuckin' reason 
you're standing 
in the middle of my bedroom, 
you're gonna... 
you're gonna see me 
get my octopus. 
Your octopus? 
That's the octopus. 
Excuse me. 
- [KNOCK ON DOOR] 
- Who is it? 
Okay, 
it's the cops again. 
Look, 
just go out the back, okay? 
There's a gate 
in the backyard. 
And for the record, 
the next time 
you're gonna put on, 
like, a little disguise 
or whatever the hell that is, 
it would be a lot more effective if you put it on 
after you come around 
visiting people like me, okay? I'm coming! 
TRACY: 
I was up at the cabin, 
and I just got your message. 
Page 32/44
Um, I'm driving back now. 
Call me when you can. 
HEATHER: 
it's Heather Anderson. 
And I just wanted 
to call and say 
you seemed really cool, 
and I liked you. 
So, um, you've got the job 
if you want it. 
Okay, call back. Bye. 
[CELLPHONE DIALING] 
[PHONE RINGING] 
Hello? 
Nick? 
NICK: 
Yeah, this is Nick. 
Good, well, then, 
maybe you can tell me 
what's going on. 
Uh, what d'ya mean? 
Well, we're here, 
and we don't see Devin 
anywhere. 
Is this 
Cassandra's assistant? 
Yes. 
We've been waiting 
for 20 minutes. 
He's not already there? 
No, Nick. 
We're at Bar Marmont, 
and I've looked 
everywhere. 
Bar Marmont? 
Yes, I mean, 
I just stepped outside, 
but I'm telling you, 
he's not here. 
Well, that's wrong. 
Wrong? 
Well, then, where is he?

[INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] 
[SOFT MUSIC PLAYS] 
KEITH: 
Yeah. 
Well, one drink, 
and all will be groovy. 
I guarantee it. 
[CHUCKLES] 
You know what you want? 
Um... 
If you don't know 
what you want, 
it means that you want 
the voodoo juice. 
- Okay. 
- Great. 
[MUSIC CONTINUES] 
[INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] 
So, wanna talk about it? 
Um... 
Your bad day? 
No. I don't think so. 
All right. 
Suit yourself. 
I'll be right back. 
Okay. 
I'll be right here. 
[MUSIC CONTINUES] 
- Jill. 
- [GASPS] 
Hey, Devin. 
What are you 
doing here? 
Nothing. 
- Are you following me? 
- No. 
Did you call Nick? 
Your assistant? 
All right, 
cut the bullshit. 
I have literally no idea 
what you're talking about. 
- Really? 
Page 34/44
- I'm here for a meeting. 
With who? 
As you know, 
this is one of my spots. 
In fact, I'm pretty sure 
that you started coming here 
because I told you this was 
a great spot for meetings. 
What'd you do 
to your hair? 
Nothing. 
You think I killed her, 
don't you? 
I don't know 
what I think. 
Why are you 
following me? 
I already told you, 
I'm not following you. 
You think 
you understood Heather. 
I do understand Heather. 
No, you don't. 
- Where were you last night? 
- [SCOFFS] 
I don't have to answer 
your questions. 
- Why can't you tell me where you were? - You know what? 
Tell me if Heather 
was really with Tracy. 
- Why does that matter? 
- I wanna know. 
Why? 
Fuck you, Jill.

- I don't have the key, so... 
- Well, maybe you left on the table. - Fuckin' left it at the fuckin' bar. We can get one at the damn desk,

What the fuck? 
What? 
- Why are the lights on? 
- [SCOFFS] 
How should I know? 
Sorry. 
You're freakin' me out. 
Okay, we need to talk about 
last night. 
CASSANDRA: 
Were you at home? 
Yeah. 
All night? 
Yeah. 
Why are you asking? 
Probably won't even 
come up, 
but if the police 
talk to you 
I need you to tell them 
that we were together. 
CASSANDRA: 
Last night, 
up until this morning. 
[SIGHS] 
When I talked to the police, 
I said I spent the night 
at your house. 
Why did you 
tell them that? 
I went up to my place in 
Joshua Tree last night, alone, which means 
I don't have an alibi. 
Page 36/44
So, you want me 
to lie to the police? 
You trust me, right? 
Look, 
if it was gonna be a big deal, I wouldn't ask you 
to do it. 
It's just... [SIGHS] 
It's gonna make it easier, 
okay? 
I have to pee. 
DEVIN: 
[GRUNTS, CLEARS THROAT] 
- [KNOCK ON DOOR] 
- I wanna take a shower. 
If I can take a shower, 
I think I'll feel better.

[TIRES SQUEAL, ENGINE REVS] 
- [SIGHS] 
- You okay? 
I dunno. 
I want you 
to look at something. 
- What's this? 
- I found it in Devin's hotel room. They... they were missing 
from Heather's house, 
and the detective 
that I was talking to, 
what he thinks is 
that someone took them 
to make it look like 
a burglary gone wrong. 
Devin's obsessed 
with these things. 
How do you know this isn't 
another one that he owns? 
Oh, I dunno. 
Page 37/44
I guess I don't. 
TRACY: 
Everything okay? 
Yeah. Fine. 
I brought you these. 
What are they? 
They'll calm you down 
and help you sleep. 
Don't worry, 
I take them all the time. 
Oh, God. 
I do wanna sleep. 
It's okay. 
It'll be good to sleep.

the whole truth. 
Um, 
I hope you'll call me back.

[THUDS] 
- HEATHER: 
- Jesus, fuck! 
Hello to you, too. 
Oh, my God, I knew it. 
I knew you weren't dead. 
Of course 
you're not fucking dead! 
I'm really happy 
Page 39/44
you're here. 
You killed her, 
didn't you? 
You must've shot her 
in self defense. 
What are you doing here? 
I was so scared. 
I was... 
so fucking scared. 
And I don't know, maybe I 
wanted to disappear anyway. 
You know the police 
think that I did it? 
My prints are on the gun, 
and I'm the only one 
who they're sure 
was at the house. 
Okay, but now you can help me, though. 
- I'll go back to sort it out. - Help you?! 
Heather, 
I'm the one that needs help. 
Okay, yeah, we can do that, too. Don't worry about it. 
Oh, you're always telling me 
not to worry about it. 
Yeah, because you worry 
too much. 
I thought that you were dead! 
I thought that you were gone! 
- The police think that I killed you! - Okay. I'm sorry. 
I know I fucked up. 
I'm sorry. 
I did a bad thing. 
I just... 
I knew they'd figure out 
it wasn't me who was dead, 
eventually. 
Yeah, 
that's not the fucking point. 
Me and Tracy 
thought you'd be okay. 
Page 40/44
Look, we'll stay here tonight, we'll hang out, 
and in the morning 
we'll go. 
No. It's not fun. 
It's not 
a fucking sleepover. 
Of course it's not fun. 
I know it's not fun. 
Jill... 
Look, I know 
it's not a sleepover. 
I... I'm sorry. 
Look, I know it seems like 
I don't get it. 
But I do. I get it. 
Jill, I'm sorry, 
but I need you. 
Not as my assistant, 
but as my friend. 
You're like... you're like 
my only fucking friend! 
Jill, don't go. 
I'll do whatever it takes 
to make it up to you, okay? 
Just, um... 
Just try not to fuck up my face permanently. 
Okay, sorry. 
No, no. 
Just... just do it. 
[CLEARS THROAT] 
Do it how you want. 
Okay. 
[DOOR OPENS] 
Hey. 
They're ready for you. 
Whenever you are. 
I'm not ready. 
Yes, you are. 
- [KNOCK ON DOOR] 
- Come in. 
Hey, um, 
so we're pretty much set, 
Page 41/44
but Vanessa wanted 
to come and talk to Heather 
for a moment 
before we get started? 
Okay. Just a minute. 
Thanks. 
[DOOR CLOSES] 
[KNOCK ON DOOR] 
Come in. 
Expecting someone else? 
Yeah. 
Listen, don't blame 
the guys upstairs. 
I had to work my badge 
pretty hard to get past them. 
What are you 
doing here? 
Can't I stop by 
to say hello? 
Is everything 
all right? 
Yes. Yeah. Fine. 
There's no problem. 
So anyway, I-I... 
I heard about this interview, 
and I gotta admit, 
I was pretty curious 
about it. 
Curious how? 
I know 
I could watch on TV, 
but, um, listen, 
would you mind 
if I stuck around 
to see it live? 
The way I understand it, 
a lot of these interviews 
wind up 
on the cutting room floor, 
and I'd like to see 
the whole thing. 
You know? 
I'm sorry. 
- Is... is the case closed? 
Page 42/44
- Yes. 
No, the case is closed. 
This is entirely 
unofficial. 
In fact, 
it's really up to you. 
I'll go if you want, 
but I would like to stay. 
- [KNOCK ON DOOR] 
- Uh, just a minute. 
So what d'ya say? 
You can stay. 
Thank you. 
I wanna start by saying, 
it's good to see you. 
I mean it. 
It's good to see you, 
too. 
I remember 
when I first met you, 
what impressed me so much was 
how self-assured you were. 
- I think you were 17? 
- I was 18. 
Well, I can honestly say 
that you have not lost 
an ounce of grace 
over the years. 
Thank you. 
But now you find yourself 
in the aftermath of 
a very difficult situation, 
one that goes way beyond movies, well beyond celebrity. 
You're right, 
this is, um... 
- It's real life. 
- Yes. 
I want you to tell me... 
tell me something 
you told me 
right before 
we started today. 
I... 
Page 43/44
I said that nothing 
was off-limits. 
That's right. 
And what about 
the legal consequences 
of you 
speaking with me today? 
I care about the truth. 
That's why I'm here. 
And what is the truth? 
This... this girl was... 
was in my house. 
I was afraid. 
Help me understand 
what you were thinking 
when that girl and you 
made eye contact.
