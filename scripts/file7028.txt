FROM A BLACK SCREEN - 
WHAT SOUNDS LIKE A ROARING STORM... SURROUNDING US... ALMOST 
DEAFENING.  
SUPER: March 24th, 2034.  Four Days After The Event.  
FADE IN:
 EXT. ARCTIC CIRCLE - DUSK
 ANGLE ON AUGUSTINE, (70), heavy winter coat, weathered face 
covered in gray stubble, standing at the center of a violent 
blizzard, peering upward.  The deep lines on his face are 
from squinting, not smiling.  Augustine doesn’t smile.  
Snow swirls all around him... that storm THUNDERING.    
Then we see what’s causing this storm... a large, MILITARY
STYLE HELICOPTER is rising into the dim dusk-blue arctic sky.  
We can make out the SILHOUETTES OF FIGURES in the windows.  
Augustine watches it ascend.  The snowstorm around him 
settles... the THUNDER OF THE HELICOPTER FADES.  The 
helicopter continues rising... JOINING SEVERAL OTHER COPTERS 
further above... already bending into formation.  
This is a LARGE EVACUATION.  
MOSELY (O.S.)
 Still time to change your mind!  
Augustine looks over to MASON MOSELY, (60s), striding across 
a path in the snow toward him.  Beyond Mosely there’s a LAST 
HELICOPTER still grounded on the FLAGGED LANDING AREA... MEN, 
WOMEN, and a FEW CHILDREN HURRIEDLY FILING IN.  
MOSELY (CONT’D)
 Transferring the last of the 
outpost families, but still some 
open seats.  
Augustine shakes his head... looks back to all those 
helicopters dotting the sky.    
AUGUSTINE
 Like a race to see who can die 
first.  
Mosely moves beside Augustine... shares the view.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 2.
 There’s nothing left out there for 
them.  
MOSELY
 The slim hope of reaching a 
bunker... but more of just a chance 
to see family... friends... even if 
it’s only for a few minutes. 
(beat)
 Desperation can turn even the 
smartest of us into fools.  
A LONG BEAT, then-
MOSELY (CONT’D)
 We were so close.  But we still 
failed, didn’t we?    
AUGUSTINE
 Every day.  In some way or another. 
(beat)
 Then the world failed us.  
MOSELY
 It’s your infectious positive 
attitude that always sustained me 
through the bleak times.
 (looking around)
 You’re going to get bored up here 
all by yourself.  
AUGUSTINE
 I’ve been waiting years to finally 
get rid of
Augustine COUGHS INTO HIS MITTEN... lightly at first, but 
grows harder.  When he lowers the mitten, there’s BLOOD 
DOTTING THE MITTEN AND HIS SNOWY STUBBLE.  Mosely gives a 
gentle nod toward the blood.  Augustine wipes it from his 
beard.  
MOSELY
 The terminal patient outlives the 
rest of humanity.  Someone should 
put you in a medical journal.    
AUGUSTINE
 Shame there’ll be nobody around to 
read it.  I could’ve been famous.  
MOSELY
 (smiles)
 Continue your treatments anyway.  
3.
 AUGUSTINE
 If I was in a hurry to die, I’d go 
with you.  
An O.S. WHISTLE.  A SOLDIER waving from that last helicopter.  
Mosely waves back, then shakes Augustine’s hand.  This is a 
sad moment... two friends saying goodbye for the last time.    
MOSELY
 I’ll miss our chess matches, 
Augustine.  And all those hours 
spent looking up.    
Mosely turns... starts back for the helicopter.  
MOSELY (CONT’D)
 Don’t forget to turn off the lights 
before you leave!  You know how 
pissed the suits back home get when 
we run up the power bill!  
Mosely gives Augustine a final grinning wave.  
EXT. HELICOPTER - DUSK
 Mosely moves toward the open door, as a FRANTIC WOMAN with a 
TODDLER in her arms, pushes back out of the helicopter.    
FRANTIC WOMAN
 Jonathan!  Michael!  
The Soldier extends his arm, stopping her.  
SOLDIER
 What’s the problem?  
FRANTIC WOMAN
 My sons.  They aren’t here!  
SOLDIER
 You sure?
 The Frantic Woman nods as she pushes past.  
SOLDIER (CONT’D)
 Hey!  We can’t wait for you! 
MOSELY
 (to the Soldier)
 Are you checking off names?  
4.
 SOLDIER
 Nobody gave me a list.  I just put 
people on the chopper.  
An OLDER WOMAN scrambles out.  
OLDER WOMAN
 Katherine!  The boys already left!
 The Frantic Woman spins back.  
OLDER WOMAN (CONT’D)
 (pointing up)
 They put them on another 
helicopter.  I saw them.  
FRANTIC WOMAN
 Alone?!  
OLDER WOMAN
 They’re with Doctor Rogg.  She said 
to tell you she’ll meet you on the 
ground.  
SOLDIER
 Okay then, that’s that.  We gotta 
go.  Now.  
The Older Woman helps the Frantic Woman back onto the 
helicopter.  Mosely moves past the Soldier.  
SOLDIER (CONT’D)
 (off Augustine)
 What about him?  
MOSELY
 He’s staying.  
The Soldier squints back toward Augustine.  
SOLDIER
 Why?  
MOSELY
 Because the rest of us aren’t.  
The Soldier rolls his eyes... follows Mosely in, sealing the 
helicopter door behind.  --AUGUSTINE watches the chopper blades whir to life... the 
snow turning into a cloud as the helicopter rises upward... 
higher... falling into the rear of the formation.    
5.
 Augustine waits for the row of dots to disappear, then 
turns... starts walking toward the LARGE, DESERTED COMPOUND 
OF BLUE AND WHITE STEEL BUILDINGS nestled against the incline 
of the Cordillera Mountains.  Many of the buildings are 
enclosed by circular glass igloo-type structures.  Several 
SATELLITE ARRAYS aim their oversized dishes upward.   
A MASSIVE DOMED OBSERVATORY stands above everything else at 
one end... large telescope aimed up toward the arctic sky. 
This is the Barbeau Observatory Station.  And Augustine is 
all alone here.
 INT. COMPOUND KITCHEN - NIGHT
 ON A MICROWAVE OVEN.  A frozen meal slowly spinning inside.  
DING.  Augustine pops open the door... removes the plastic 
tray of food.  
INT. COMPOUND CAFETERIA - NIGHT
 Rows of empty tables.  Augustine sits at one in the far 
corner, eating.  The room is silent except for Augustine’s 
fork dragging across the plastic tray.  
INT. OBSERVATORY CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
 Augustine stands at the center of the room, surveying the 
abandoned space... the remains of his colleagues’ desks: 
piles of research, personal items, half-filled coffee cups.
 His eyes settle on a computer monitor... an INFRARED WORLD 
MAP ON THE SCREEN... a SIMULATION PLAYING OUT... YELLOW 
BECOMING ORANGE, BECOMING RED... SPREADING OVER EVERYTHING.   
He stares at the image a moment, then grabs a TRASH CAN... 
starts wiping all the desks clean... adjusting the 
equipment... making this place his own.  
CUT TO:
 A WIDE SWATH OF DARK ARCTIC SKY.  Milky clusters of stars in 
an unpolluted black night.  Until the sky GLITCHES, then 
shifts left... 
...and we realize this is an image projected on Augustine’s 
monitor - images received from the telescope.  With a few 
clicks, the image ZOOMS... pushing through deep space... past 
a SUPERNOVA EXPLODING with light.  
6.
 With a few more clicks, Augustine sets the control room into 
motion, the high tech equipment powering up. Lone computers 
processing.  Monitors flashing.  
Augustine opens a drawer... pulls out a glass and whiskey 
bottle... fills the glass... takes a sip as he moves over to 
an extensive, wall-sized, working chart of our solar system 
covered in pins and post-its.  
He drags his finger from Earth... past Mars, to Jupiter... 
weaving through its 69 moons, and through an asteroid belt 
labeled LOFTHOUSE BELT... landing on a single moon, K-23. 
Augustine moves to the telescope... the whiskey whirling in 
his glass as he types in coordinates.  With a SLOW HUM, the 
telescope rotates its position in the sky, and projects an 
image - the small, pale grey dot of a distant exo-planet.  
Augustine stares at it.  And we HEAR THE ECHO OF A CROWD’S 
DISTANT APPLAUSE, as-
FLASHCUT TO:
 INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
 The APPLAUSE is all around us now, as a YOUNGER AUGUSTINE, 
(30s), gives a presentation at a Ted-Talk-style astrophysics 
conference.  Dr. Augustine Lofthouse is printed across the 
screen behind him.  
AUGUSTINE
 In our galaxy alone, there are 
billions of stars. 
A large image of our galaxy lights up the screen.
 AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Each one a sun to its own solar 
system.  And most of these suns 
have planets.  So it stands to 
reason that, of these hundreds of 
billions of “exoplanets” that exist 
in our galaxy, at least one of them 
has the potential to support life.  
Augustine talks over images of different planets. 
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 In the last five years, we’ve 
identified over 3,000 of these 
exoplanets, in hopes that one would 
lie within the habitable zone.  A 
Goldilocks planet.  
(MORE)
7.
 AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Not too hot, not too cold... just 
right to fulfill mankind’s growing 
need for a second home.    
The images behind Augustine look anything but habitable.  Ice 
planets, water worlds, and gaseous orbs fill the screen.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 But so far, we’ve found none.  And 
the math says that the further out 
in the galaxy we look, the longer 
and more difficult it will be for 
man to ever reach it.    
Augustine pulls up an image of Jupiter.
 AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 So what if we looked a little 
closer to home.  Jupiter, with its 
69 moons, right here in our solar 
system.  Some of them life
sustaining, but none of them 
habitable... certainly not a 
Goldilocks.  
An image of a massive cloud of asteroids.
 AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 And just beyond Jupiter, the thick 
cloud of a circumstellar disc of 
rock, otherwise known as the end of 
the line.  Until now.
 The same image from the observatory projects on screen... the 
steady spiral of a small, pale grey dot of an exo-planet.
 AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 This is K-23, Jupiter’s previously 
undiscovered moon.  Not quite an 
exoplanet, this moon’s atmosphere 
is governed, not by the sun, but by 
Jupiter itself.  And while further 
probing will need to test its 
atmospheric habitability, we can 
confidently say that based on its 
mass, radial velocity, and orbit... 
it could be just right.
 INT. AUDITORIUM LOBBY - NIGHT
 A large reception following Augustine’s presentation.  A 
small swarm of people form around him, as he shakes hands, 
and signs a few copies of his book: AFTER EARTH.
8.
 He continues moving through the people... to the open bar... 
signals to the BARTENDER. 
AUGUSTINE
 Whiskey, neat.
 The Bartender rests a glass in front of Augustine.  Augustine 
stares at it a moment, as if he’s unsure whether to drink it.
 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
 How much of what you’re searching 
for is reality?
 Augustine looks up... to the face of the most beautiful WOMAN 
he’s ever seen... smiling at him as she sits beside him.  We 
don’t know it yet, but her name is JEAN.    
JEAN (CONT’D)
 And how much of your Goldilocks 
planet is just a fairytale?  
And before Augustine can answer, we’re interrupted by a 
BEEPING sound. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Augustine breaks his focus from the whirling liquid in his 
hand... turns off his own BEEPING WRIST WATCH.
 INT. COMPOUND MEDICAL ROOM - NIGHT
 Augustine unbuttons his shirt, revealing an IV PORT in his 
chest.  He connects an IV LINE to the port.  The line runs up 
to a hanging bag.  
Augustine settles into a recliner... turns on an IPOD.  VAN 
MORRISON’S Into The Mystic flows from a speaker... as the 
drip of his CHEMO TREATMENT begins.  
VAN MORRISON (V.O.)
 We were born before the wind.
 Also younger than the sun.
 Ere the bonnie boat was won as we 
sailed into the mystic.
 He watches the liquid pulse into his chest, then gazes up... 
THROUGH THE GLASS ROOF... to the ENDLESS BLANKET OF STARS 
flickering above, as the MUSIC PLAYS.  
VAN MORRISON (V.O.)
 Hark, now hear the sailors cry.
 Smell the sea and feel the sky.
9.
 EXT. BARBEAU OBSERVATORY COMPOUND - NIGHT
 The silhouettes of the structures against the moon-swept 
snow.  The glowing sky sparkling overhead.  
VAN MORRISON (V.O.)
 Let your soul and spirit fly into 
the mystic.
 We FOLLOW THE MUSIC UPWARDS INTO THE NIGHT SKY... floating 
toward all those stars.  
EXT. ARCTIC WILDERNESS - NIGHT
 An Arctic Fox trots across the dim landscape.  
INT. COMPOUND - AUGUSTINE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
 Augustine lies in bed, staring at the BUZZING ALARM CLOCK... 
watches the 7:03 changes to 7:04... finally reaches out to 
tap the clock... the BUZZING STOPS.  
Augustine rises up with some effort... painful and stiff.  He 
sits there a moment, catching his breath, then pulls open the 
top drawer of the night stand... reaches inside... a FEW 
MEDICINE BOTTLES sprawled on top of a thin mess of old papers 
and photographs.  The bottles all have something about “...as 
needed for pain” printed on the labels. 
He lifts one of the bottles... tosses a few pills into his 
mouth, then drops the bottle back inside.  The bottle rolls 
to a rest on a couple CREASED PHOTOGRAPHS... one with a 
PARTIAL GLIMPSE OF JEAN.  
Another photo is face-down... a faded-ink June 14, 2008 
scribbled on the back of the photo.  
INT. OBSERVATORY CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
 Augustine stands at a window, sipping a cup of coffee.  That 
same constant blue-dusk outside... except for a SLIVER OF 
PINK staining the dark sky.  
A SHAPE APPEARS FROM THE SHADOWS... a POLAR BEAR with a BLUE 
TAGGING COLLAR.  It lumbers across the compound.  
AUGUSTINE
 Welcome back, George.  Just the two 
of us now.
10.
 Augustine watches the Polar Bear wander up and over the crest 
of a hill, then grabs his coat from a table.  
EXT. BARBEAU OBSERVATORY COMPOUND - NIGHT
 Augustine follows the Polar Bear’s tracks in the snow... up 
the hill.  He’s breathing hard by the time he reaches the 
top... looks down to the snowy valley below.  There’s a rosy 
pink streak of sunlight across the white.  
The Polar Bear reaches that streak, then plops down, basking 
in the warm light... looking exhausted.
 Augustine sits stiffly on the ground.  
AUGUSTINE
 Our morning walks aren’t as easy as 
they used to be, huh, old man?
 Then Augustine and the Polar Bear both look up to the sky... 
waiting for something.  The sky suddenly turns to fire, a 
deep orange, then crimson.  Augustine closes his eyes... lets 
the warm sunlight hit his face. 
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 But they’re worth it.  
A few moments of sun basking Augustine’s face, then almost as 
quickly as it appeared, the sun sinks away... the dim blue 
night returns.  
WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
 And just like that it’s gone.  
Augustine opens his eyes... looks beside him... sees Jean 
standing in the snow, wearing just a t-shirt and shorts.  
She’s staring up at the sky.    
JEAN
 A lot like life.  
(smiles at Augustine)
 Comes and goes in a blink.  
Augustine stares at Jean... almost seems a little scared.  He 
closes his eyes... reopens them... JEAN IS GONE.  
INT. OBSERVATORY CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
 Augustine at the telescope... peering through the lens... 
typing some data into a computer.  Then he FLINCHES IN 
PAIN... 
11.
 just enough that he needs to steady himself against the 
desk... stands there a moment waiting for it to pass, then 
sits down... catches his breath.  
He notices the CHESSBOARD... pieces spaced around like a game 
was stopped in the middle.  He stares at the board a moment, 
then moves his black bishop... takes a white rook.  
INT. COMPOUND KITCHEN - NIGHT
 Augustine holds a bowl of cereal... pours a stream of soy 
milk over it.  He starts eating as he walks out. 
INT. COMPOUND CAFETERIA - NIGHT
 Augustine enters with the cereal... sits down and freezes mid
bite... because there’s a HALF-EMPTY BOWL OF CEREAL ALREADY 
SITTING ON THE TABLE... spoon tilted on the edge.  
Augustine looks around, half-expecting to see someone else in 
here with him.  But of course the room is empty.  Augustine’s 
eyes drift from his bowl to the other... then to the 
kitchen... finally-
AUGUSTINE
 Half dose on meds, asshole.  We’re 
not doing this losing it shit.  
Augustine lifts the other bowl, pouring the contents into his 
own... continues eating.  
EXT. BARBEAU OBSERVATORY COMPOUND - NIGHT
 The moon’s soft glow over the compound.  
INT. COMPOUND - AUGUSTINE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
 The alarm clock BEEPS.  Augustine sleeps on his side, back to 
the clock... not budging.  There are a few specks of blood on 
the pillow near his mouth.  The Clock JUST KEEPS BEEPING.  
INT. COMPOUND MEDICAL ROOM - NIGHT
 Augustine stands on a DOCTOR’S SCALE... keeps tapping the 
weight over pound by pound... lighter and lighter.  It 
finally balances.  He stares at it... not happy.  
12.
 AUGUSTINE
 I know, Doc... wasting away.  Gotta 
keep the weight up.  
INT. OBSERVATORY CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
 Augustine at a desk... asleep in a chair. -- THE TELESCOPE... suddenly HUMS TO LIFE ON ITS OWN... 
begins slowly rotating. 
Augustine’s eyes blink awake to the HUMMING SOUND.  He 
focuses on the moving telescope... then the computer screen 
image of the telescope’s view... gliding over dark space.
 The telescope comes to a stop.  
Augustine stands... goes to the computer... squints at the 
empty space on screen... taps some keys... zooming in... 
tighter... tighter... until a SPECK APPEARS ON THE SCREEN.  
He types in few more directives... a LIST OF ACTIVE MISSIONS 
satellites, probe missions, manned crafts.  Augustine scrolls 
down the list... 
NEOWISE - INACTIVE 
VOYAGER 3 - INACTIVE
 INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION - EVACUATED
 ORION 2 - COMPLETED
 AETHER - ACTIVE
 ...stops.  Augustine’s cursor hovers over AETHER.  He clicks 
on it... a photo of Aether’s FIVE PERSON FLIGHT CREW appears.  
He stares at it a moment, then clicks on Aether’s FLIGHT 
PLAN.  It fills the screen.  Augustine studies it. 
Suddenly, a FIRE ALARM SOUNDS... lights blinking overhead.  
Augustine’s head snaps around to the sound.  
INT. COMPOUND KITCHEN - NIGHT
 Augustine enters the smoke-filled kitchen... flames consuming 
an empty frying pan, still on the stove.  
He grabs a fire extinguisher from the wall, sprays the pan, 
putting out the fire... then stands there in the smoke and 
mist, staring at the pan. 
13.
 AUGUSTINE
 I didn’t do that.  I didn’t do 
that!  
Augustine heaves the extinguisher away with a frustrated 
toss... slides down the wall to the floor.  And when he does, 
a FRIGHTENED LITTLE GIRL, (8), IN A YELLOW DRESS COMES INTO 
VIEW, HIDDEN BENEATH A SHELF, STARING BACK AT AUGUSTINE.  
Augustine returns the stare, not certain he can trust his 
eyes... sure he’s just seeing things again.  So he closes 
them... holds them closed for a long moment before opening.  
The Little Girl is still there.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Goddammit.  
INT. COMPOUND HALLWAY - NIGHT
 Augustine rushes along the dorm-like hall, throwing open 
doors...
 AUGUSTINE
 Hello?!
 ...scanning in empty bedrooms.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Anybody?!  
Augustine reaches the last door... pushes it open... empty.  
He stares at it, thinking... then looks back down the hall... 
the Little Girl stands at the far end.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Is anyone else with you?!  
The Little Girl doesn’t answer.  
INT. OBSERVATORY CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
 Augustine’s holding the radio mic, dialing through channels 
and frequencies.  
AUGUSTINE
 Repeat... this is Barbeau 
Observatory.  An outpost family 
member was left behind during the 
evacuation.  Someone needs to 
return for her.       
14.
 Nothing but static.  He switches the channel again.   
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 This is Barbeau Observatory.  I 
have an outpost child here.   
Augustine looks to the doorway... the Little Girl is standing 
there, nervous... afraid.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 What’s your name?  
The Little Girl just stares back.   
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Do you speak English?  
(in Spanish)
 Spanish?  
The Little Girl doesn’t react.   
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 (into radio)
 An unidentified girl.  She isn’t 
talking.  Seven or eight years-old 
maybe.  I think she’s alone.  She 
needs immediate pickup.  
Augustine waits for some answer... still only static.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Jesus Christ.  
(to the Little Girl)
 You’re not supposed to be here.  
The Little Girl kneels down in the doorway... just stares 
back at him.  Augustine dials in another frequency.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 This is Barbeau Observatory.  
Eighty-one, fifty-four North.  
Seventy-five, one West.  
EXT. BARBEAU OBSERVATORY COMPOUND - NIGHT
 The blurred figure of Augustine is visible through the icy 
window.  
AUGUSTINE (V.O.)
 If anyone is receiving this, please 
respond.  
(beat)
 I have a serious problem.  
15.
 EXT. ARCTIC WILDERNESS - NIGHT
 The wind whips across the ground, swirling miniature snow
tornadoes over the surface.  
EXT. BARBEAU OBSERVATORY COMPOUND - NIGHT
 The steel hangar doors sway and slam in the gusts.  
INT. OBSERVATORY CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
 ANGLE ON AUGUSTINE’S HAND pouring a glass of whiskey.  
Augustine’s standing in the far corner of the room with the 
bottle and glass... eyeing the Little Girl sitting in the 
doorway as he takes a drink.
 AUGUSTINE
 What the hell am I supposed to do 
with you?  
The Little Girl offers no answer.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 What are you doing here?  
The Little Girl’s expression doesn’t change.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 (angry)
 Well I know you’re not the world’s 
youngest goddamn astrophysicist.  I 
would have heard about you.    
Augustine’s tone frightens the Little Girl... tears fill her 
eyes.  She stares at the floor a moment, then stands... walks 
out.  Augustine stands there a moment... takes a drink.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Shit.  
Augustine puts down the glass... walks to the doorway... sees 
the Little Girl moving down a hallway, her yellow dress 
fluttering as she goes.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Hey.  
She doesn’t look back.  Augustine gives an ANNOYED GRUNT, 
then follows after her.  
16.
 INT. COMPOUND HALLWAY - DUSK
 Augustine trails the Little Girl along the hall... watches 
her veer through a doorway.  He reaches it... looks in to see 
it’s a STORAGE CLOSET.  
The Little Girl drops down onto a pile of scavenged blankets 
and winter coats.  The closet’s white walls have several 
magic marker-drawn PURPLE FLOWERS (IRISES) on them.  
AUGUSTINE
 (glancing around closet)
 This is where you’ve been staying.  
Christ.     
(off the pictures)
 I guess you drew those?  
The Little Girl doesn’t answer.  Augustine just stares down 
at her a beat, then-
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Somebody’s gotta be coming back for 
you.  
INT. COMPOUND - STORAGE CLOSET - DUSK
 The Little Girl returns Augustine’s gaze.  
AUGUSTINE
 Because I can’t help you.  Do you 
understand?  I’m the wrong person.    
They hold a look... 
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 I’m the wrong person.  
...then Augustine turns... disappears from the doorway.  Gone 
for a long moment before he appears again.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 (annoyed)
 Are you hungry?  
(mimes eating)
 Food.  Hungry?
 INT. COMPOUND CAFETERIA - DUSK
 Augustine sits on one side of the table, sipping a cup of 
coffee, watching the Little Girl directly across from him, 
gobbling down a microwaved hamburger.  
17.
 AUGUSTINE
 What about family?  Any brothers or 
sisters?  
The Little Girl doesn’t even look up... just keeps eating.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 You’re not deaf, right?  You can 
hear me talking to you?  
Nothing.  Augustine SNAPS HIS FINGERS.  The Little Girl’s 
eyes roll up... she heard that... then goes back down to the 
food.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 So that’s clear.  But you can’t 
talk.  Or just won’t.  Or just want 
to piss me off.    
(beat)
 Twelve years I’ve been here. Longer 
than you’ve been alive.  Always 
people around.  I was really 
looking forward to some alone time.  
Augustine’s eyes settle on the notepad beside her.  Another 
purple flower on the top page.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 But you do draw a good flower.  
That an Iris?    
The Little Girl’s head immediately snaps upward... as if 
Augustine called her name.  They hold a look... Augustine 
trying to understand what just happened... the Little Girl 
waiting for more.  Then Augustine points at her.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Iris.  
The Little Girl nods... immediately goes back to eating.  
Augustine watches her a long moment, then-
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Okay.  
So that’s what we’ll call the Little Girl... IRIS.  
INT. OBSERVATORY CONTROL ROOM - DUSK
 Augustine at a desk, holding the radio mic as he looks at the 
computer... that SPECK OF THE SPACESHIP AETHER still zoomed 
in on the screen.    
18.
 AUGUSTINE
 (into radio mic)
 This is Barbeau Observatory.  Is 
anyone receiving this?   
Static.  Iris walks up beside Augustine... shares the view.  
He notices... watches her lean closer.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Don’t touch anything.  
Iris reaches toward the screen, but Augustine pulls her arm 
down... shakes his head.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 No touching. 
(motions around the room)
 Anything. 
Iris look back to that speck on screen.  Augustine watches.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Aether.  
(taps the screen)
 It’s a spaceship.  Far away.  
Augustine points to another monitor zoomed in on a planet.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 On its way back from a planet 
called K-23.  That was supposed to 
be our future.
 Augustine stares at the speck a beat...
 AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Didn’t quite work out like we’d 
hoped.  
...then changes radio frequency.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 (into radio mic)
 This is Barbeau Observat
Augustine COUGHS... hard enough to splatter blood across the 
desk.  Iris steps away, frightened.  
Augustine self-consciously wipes a sleeve across his mouth... 
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 I’m sorry.  It just... I...
19.
 ...grabs a sheet of paper to wipe the blood from the desk.  
And he COUGHS AGAIN... harder... longer... makes his way out 
of the room.  
INT. COMPOUND - BATHROOM - DUSK
 Augustine is on his knees over a commode, coughing... 
vomiting.  He catches his breath... slides around against the 
wall... sees Iris standing just outside the door, watching 
him.  Augustine weakly pushes the door closed.  
INT. COMPOUND - AUGUSTINE’S BEDROOM - DUSK
 Augustine sits on the edge of his bed, digging some pain 
pills from the nightstand.  He gulps them back... tilts over 
on the bed, his eyes fluttering closed... until he spots Iris 
dragging her pile of blankets and coats into his room... 
building her nest.    
AUGUSTINE
 No... not here.  
Augustine rolls out of bed... yanking Iris’ nest out the 
door.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 This is my room. 
INT. COMPOUND - EMPTY BEDROOM - DUSK
 Augustine tosses the blankets and coats onto an empty 
mattress.  
AUGUSTINE
 Here.  
Iris moves beside Augustine... stares at the bed.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 You sleep here.  
Augustine walks out... leaves Iris alone in the room.  
INT. COMPOUND - AUGUSTINE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
 Augustine falls back into his bed with a groan... lies there 
in pain... hears RUSTLING BEHIND HIM... Iris dragging her 
gear back into his room... making her nest on the floor.  
20.
 Augustine doesn’t have the strength to fight... just looks 
back to the digital clock.  1:43.  His eyes drift closed.  
DISSOLVE TO:
 BLACK... QUIET... UNTIL A GENTLE CHIMING RISES AROUND US.  
INT. TINY ROOM - MORNING
 ANGLE ON A DIGITAL CLOCK TABLET SCREEN... 6:00 AM.  A hand 
enters the frame... taps the screen.  The chiming quiets.   
Then we see who silenced the clock... SULLY, (30s), a mass of 
flowing brown hair around her naturally pretty face.  She 
rises from her bed, wearing a tank top and bike shorts.    
Sully stands up in the windowless space... steps into a blue 
jumpsuit, tugging it halfway and tying the sleeves around her 
waist.  She ponytails her hair as she slides back the PRIVACY 
CURTAIN.
 INT. HALLWAY - MORNING
 Sully steps out... starts down a narrow hall... past some 
other open curtains, revealing more windowless sleep 
spaces... various personal touches, photographs, sketches, 
book-shelves, and reading lights.
 One curtain is still closed.  Sully brushes her hand against 
it as she passes.  
SULLY
 You awake, Devi?
 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
 Make it dark again.  
Sully continues on toward the warm light of morning sunshine 
ahead... steps into a LARGE LIVING SPACE filled with 
futuristic machines... a RING-SHAPED CENTRIFUGE SPINNING AT 
THE CENTER... OVERHEAD LIGHTS PROJECTING THAT WARM SUNSHINE 
GLOW... and WINDOWS WITH ONLY DEEP DARK SPACE BEYOND.    
This is “LITTLE EARTH” on the Spacecraft AETHER.  
INT. AETHER - LITTLE EARTH - SPACE
 Sully moves straight for the kitchen area, grabbing a protein 
bar from the cabinet.  
21.
 She glances to the EXERCISE SPACE, where COMMANDER HARPER 
(40), Montana-rugged, runs steel-faced on the treadmill.  
She catches his eye... they exchange a wave, and Harper 
immediately hits the STOP BUTTON... the treadmill winds down.  
Sully continues past a sleek couch, where IVANOV, (40s), 
Aether’s Russian pilot is slumped back, playing a RACING 
VIDEO GAME.  
SULLY
 You started early.  
IVANOV
 Champions never rest.  
SULLY
 Still trying to beat the times your 
boys sent up here, huh?  
Ivanov uses body-english trying to keep his car on the track, 
but it crashes violently into a wall... spins out.  
SULLY (CONT’D)
 And they win again.  Some pilot you 
are.  
Ivanov tosses the controller away.
 IVANOV
 It’s like they pay you to distract 
me.  
SULLY
 I do it for free.  
Sully continues toward a ladder... climbs... begins to float.
 INT. AETHER SPACECRAFT - SPACE
 Sully launches herself out of the gravitational heaviness of 
Little Earth and its spinning centrifuge... up into the body 
of the ship... a zero gravity circular hallway.   
Sully floats past a GLASS LAB, where South African 
astrodynamicist THEBES, (38), glances up from a computer 
screen filled with COURSE MANEUVER COMPUTATIONS.  They 
exchange a smile and nod as Sully floats through the glass
domed CUPOLA... stars glowing against the blanket of deep 
space.  
She continues on... veers into-
22.
 INT. AETHER - COMMUNICATION POD - SPACE
 Sully pulls herself through the doorway... into a small room 
made up of walls of switches, buttons, radio equipment and 
computer screens.  There’s an ORANGE-STREAKED SPACE ROCK 
resting on her work area.   
Sully straps into her seat, holding herself secure in her 
zero-gravity office.  She PUTS ON SOME HEADPHONES.    
Harper, Thebes, and Ivanov come floating into the doorway... 
peering inside.  She sees them.  
SULLY
 Seriously?  
HARPER
 Find us a voice out there, Mission 
Specialist Sullivan, and we’ll all 
leave you alone.  
Sully starts flipping switches... turning dials.  She pulls a 
tablet from a compartment... it slips from her hand... starts 
floating away until she grasps it again.     
SULLY
 You’re giving me performance 
anxiety here.  
Sully types some coordinates on the tablet keypad, then hits 
a button... a computer screen reads “Scanning For Signals”.  
The pod is silent.  Harper, Thebes, and Ivanov are focused on 
the screen.   
THEBES
 What’s she hearing?
 Harper motions for Sully’s attention, then taps his ear.  
Sully unplugs the headphones... still nothing but silence.  
They wait... watch the screen.  Thebes closes his eyes, 
straining to hear something... anything.  Then-
HARPER
 What frequency is this?  
SULLY
 I’m running S, X, and Ka.  
Another beat of silence, then-
IVANOV
 Shit.  
HARPER
 23.
 That puts our last contact with 
Mission Control at...?  
SULLY
 Including the controlled blackout?
 HARPER
 (shakes his head)
 Post blackout.  
SULLY
 Ninety-seven hours.  
Ivanov SMACKS THE WALL...  
IVANOV
 SHIT!
 ...then propels himself back down the hallway.  
THEBES
 Any chance it’s an orbital issue?  
SULLY
 (shakes her head)
 If Mojave goes offline, Spain or 
Australia immediately grabs signal.  
No gaps.  
HARPER
 ISS?  
SULLY
 Dark.  Nobody’s talking anywhere.  
A SUDDEN BLAST OF WHITE NOISE.  Thebes shoots an excited 
glance at Sully.    
SULLY (CONT’D)
 Just coming from the Jupiter probes 
we left behind. Picking up a storm.    
Sully twists a dial... the sound grows louder.  
HARPER
 That confirms the comm issues 
aren’t on our end.  
They sit, float, think.
24.
 HARPER (CONT’D)
 Open all channels, and set to 
record any incoming transmissions 
in case something’s out there.  
(turning to leave)
 Then meet us in Little Earth.  
Sully nods.  Thebes follows Harper out, floating away down 
the hall.  Sully looks back to that SCANNING SCREEN... her 
reflection staring back at her... and she looks scared.  
HARPER (V.O.)
 Pretty clear we’ve got a problem.  
INT. AETHER SPACECRAFT - LITTLE EARTH - SPACE
 Harper sits on the corner of the dining table.  Sully leans 
against a counter with DEVI, (28), Aether’s female engineer, 
sipping coffee beside her.  
Ivanov is on the stationary bike, casually pedaling.  Thebes 
is propped on the back of the couch.  
HARPER
 We’re ninety-seven hours silent, 
and the comm issue’s not ours.  
It’s like earth just flipped a 
switch... turned itself off.
 SULLY
 With no signs of distress.  Mission 
Control’s last transmission ended 
with a “Goodnight, Aether”.  
THEBES
 And we’re positive there’s no 
chance it’s some type of glitch?  
HARPER
 Ninety-seven seconds might be a 
glitch.  Ninety-seven hours leaves 
us with some more unattractive 
possibilities. 
Ivanov snorts from the bike... stops pedaling...  
IVANOV
 (sarcastic)
 Unattractive.
 ...mumbles some Russian under his breath.
THEBES
 25.
 Two years away, and they decide to 
go dark when we’re almost home.  
DEVI
 Maybe my ex has more pull than I 
realized.  
HARPER
 In every likely scenario we’re 
looking at some type of worldwide 
event way beyond just equipment 
failure.
 The crew looks stone-faced, forced to consider the grim 
possibilities.
 SULLY
 I tried to make contact with the K
23 Colony Flight.  Should have been 
in the air a week ago.  
HARPER
 Unless it never launched.  
IVANOV
 I’m still receiving data from the 
computers from Houston.    
DEVI
 The data transfer delay is longer.  
If comms stay out, we’ll lose 
computer connectivity in another 
twenty-four hours or less.  
THEBES
 But we still have no idea why.  
Some type of large scale EMP 
attack?  
SULLY
 Or could be atmospheric, RF 
pollution, a geomagnetic storm that
IVANOV-None of that could last this long, 
or disrupt both hemispheres.  
Sully almost doesn’t want to say this, but-
SULLY
 Unless it was airborne debris, from 
something like a massive 
detonation.
IVANOV
 26.
 The word you’re looking for is 
“nuclear.”  
A BEAT, then-
DEVI
 But we would know that.  
(glancing to the others)
 Right?  I mean Mission Control 
would have informed us if
HARPER-No.
 THEBES
 There’s no benefit for them to tell 
us.  
IVANOV
 That’s company line bullshit, 
Thebes.  
THEBES
 No, that’s logic, Ivanov.  
HARPER
 You and I have done this enough 
times to know the drill, Alexy.  
Even if we assume they had time to 
alert us, what would it accomplish?  
Their job is to keep our stress 
level down.  
Ivanov starts pedaling again.  
IVANOV
 I’m calm.  Don’t I look calm?  I’m 
just sitting here imagining my wife 
and boys laughing and playing as 
they turn to ash on a radioactive 
beach.    
HARPER
 That’s what I’m talking about. None 
of us are going to fixate on worst 
case scenarios.  Does us no good.  
So until we know different, we keep 
doing our jobs.  Collect the data.  
Analyze it.  
(looking at Sully)
 While Sully does everything she can 
think of to initiate contact as our 
approach nears.
27.
 Sully nods... starts out.    
SULLY
 On it.  
HARPER
 (to the others)
 We’re gonna play this straight, 
just like any other flight home.  
‘Cause right now that’s all we can
 do.  
DEVI
 This is my only
 flight home.  Never 
done it before, so not a lot for me 
to compare it to.   
THEBES
 Some lucky charm you turned out to 
be, Devi. 
INT. AETHER - COMMUNICATION POD - SPACE
 Sully at her wall of switches, dials, and buttons.  She’s 
wearing her headphones.  WE HEAR WHAT SULLY HEARS... sounds 
like endless ocean waves crashing.  
She takes a bite of a granola bar.  A few crumbs break away, 
float around her head.  She tweaks a couple dials... picks 
the crumbs from the air, tosses them into her mouth.  
A HAND rests on Sully’s shoulder, startling her just a bit.  
She turns... sees it’s Harper.  She removes the headphones, 
and the sounds go quiet.  
HARPER
 Sorry.  
SULLY
 I get lost in the noise. 
Harper unplugs the headphones... those OCEAN WAVES crash 
around them both now.  
HARPER
 Would put me right to sleep.  
SULLY
 I wouldn’t mind that either.  You 
could just wake me when we land.  
Harper strains a half-smile... Sully notices.  
28.
 SULLY (CONT’D)
 Think it’s that bad, huh?  
HARPER
 (shrugs)
 I’ve done eleven flights.  Been at 
least one hiccup with every one of 
‘em.  
Sully breaks off part of her granola bar... floats it over to 
Harper.  
SULLY
 Maybe it’s time you start 
considering the problem is you, 
Commander Harper.  
Harper smiles... tosses the bite into his mouth.  
HARPER
 There it is.  Our first sign of 
mutiny.  
Then he pulls a DECK OF CARDS from his pocket... starts 
dealing... floating Sully’s cards over to her.  
SULLY
 (gathering cards)
 You want to change the game?  I’m 
on about a two month winning 
streak.  
Harper straps himself into the seat beside Sully... 
HARPER
 I’m pacing myself.  
...rests the deck on the desk shelf.  Sully places the space 
rock on top to hold them down.  They each look over their 
hands of cards.  
HARPER (CONT’D)
 Try to keep Devi relaxed... her 
mind occupied.  I know what to 
expect with Ivanov and Thebes.  But 
it’s her first trip. 
SULLY
 She’ll be fine.  Smartest engineer 
I’ve flown with.  
HARPER
 Smart’s great when there are things 
to do.  
(MORE)
29.
 HARPER (CONT'D)
 (beat)
 But when you’re trapped in this can 
with a buncha shit that’s out of 
your control... a little bit of 
dumb can be valuable.
 Sully discards.  Harper scoops it right up.  
HARPER (CONT’D)
 Why do you think I like you so 
much, Mission Specialist Sullivan.  
Sully smiles... their zero-gravity card game continues, as 
the universe’s waves crash around them.   
Then WE PUSH OUT THE WINDOW INTO DEEP DARK SPACE.  EVERYTHING 
GOES IMMEDIATELY SILENT...
 ...stays that way for a long moment... until STARS BEGIN TO 
APPEAR, and we realize we’re looking at a night sky... then 
we HEAR A DISTANT SQUEAKING... PAN DOWN TO TWO ARCTIC 
WOLVES... standing frozen on a hill overlooking THE BARBEAU 
OBSERVATORY COMPOUND... that SQUEAKING IN THE DISTANCE.  
EXT. BARBEAU OBSERVATORY COMPOUND - ROOFTOP - NIGHT
 Augustine stands on a compound rooftop, bundled in heavy 
winter gear, TURNING A CRANK ON THE MASSIVE RADIO ANTENNA... 
SQUEAKING as it rotates inch by inch.  
EXT. BARBEAU OBSERVATORY COMPOUND - NIGHT
 Augustine climbs down the ladder... starts back along his 
tracks toward the compound... notices the Wolf watching him 
from the hill.  
AUGUSTINE
 Nothing here for you!  
Augustine CLAPS, trying to scare the Wolves away.  But the 
animals don’t flinch.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Numbers shift in your favor and you 
get cocky, huh?  
Augustine continues toward the Observatory Building... sees 
Iris watching from a large window, her yellow dress almost 
glowing in the dim blue night.  
30.
 INT. OBSERVATORY CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
 Iris meets Augustine at the door with a steaming cup of 
coffee.  
AUGUSTINE
 (annoyed)
 I keep telling you, I don’t need 
you to do that.  You’re gonna spill 
it on something important... or 
burn yourself.  
Iris just keeps holding the cup out... until Augustine 
begrudgingly takes it.  
Augustine drags off his outer layer of clothes.
 AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 No going outside on your own.  
Understand? 
He points at the door, shakes his head.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Still no outside for you.  
Iris understands enough to nod.  Augustine moves across the 
room to the radio controls, sipping the coffee.  Iris 
follows.
 AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Hear anything while I was out 
there?  
Augustine looks to Iris... points at the radio.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Voices?  Noise?  
(points again)
 Anything?  
Iris shakes her head.  Augustine lifts the radio mic.    
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 This is Barbeau Observatory.  
Eighty-one, fifty-four North.  
Seventy-five, one West.  Channels 
open for response.  
Augustine waits... waits... starts scanning more channels and 
frequencies... keeps getting nothing but that same static.   
Iris kneels on the floor... starts drawing on the back of a 
paper... a ROCKET LAUNCHING INTO THE SKY.    
31.
 AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 The damn antenna’s our problem.  
Doesn’t matter what direction we 
put it.  Just not strong enough to 
reach where we need it to.  
(to Iris)
 That’s why they’re not answering.  
They can’t hear us.    
Iris doesn’t look up from her drawing.  Augustine just 
watches her.   
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 And you’ve got no idea the trouble 
you’re in.  
INT. COMPOUND CAFETERIA - NIGHT
 Augustine and Iris sit across from each other, both eating 
from microwaved trays.  Augustine watches Iris just picking 
at some vegetables.  
AUGUSTINE
 Yeah.  Nothing like some good green 
rubber for lunch.  I always told 
‘em they needed to give us better 
meals.  Nobody listened.    
(beat)
 When I was in the Canary Islands, 
we’d get the freshest... 
Augustine stops... rolls his eyes... realizes he might as 
well just be talking to himself.  
ANGLE ON IRIS... just brushing the food around the tray... 
WHEN A VERY GREEN PEA ROLLS ACROSS THE TABLE TOWARD HER.  
Iris looks up.  Augustine rests his empty cup on it’s side, 
the opening facing Iris.  He nods to the pea...
 AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Only thing peas are any good for.  
...then FLICKS HIS FINGER.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 You hit it.  Try to get in my cup.  
Pea soccer.  
Iris isn’t sure what’s going on.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 You never played this?  
32.
 Augustine dumps what’s left in Iris’ cup onto the tray... 
tilts hers over to match his.  Then he grabs the pea... 
flicks it... the pea bounces off the rim of her cup. 
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 So close.  
(nods to her)
 Your turn.  
Iris half-smiles... steadies a pea in front of her... flicks 
it clumsily sideways.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 God, you’re terrible.  
Iris smiles broader.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 I’ve got some serious teaching to 
do here.  
Augustine grabs another pea... cocks his finger and thumb.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Like this.  Technique won the 
Lincoln Elementary Cafeteria 
Championship.  
Augustine flicks... another near miss.  Iris’ turn... she 
sends the pea sailing high over the cup, bouncing off 
Augustine’s neck.  
AND IRIS LAUGHS.  Augustine’s jarred by the sound.
 AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Well that’s something.  
WE PULL BACK as they continue playing across the table... 
until we DRIFT OUTSIDE THE FROSTY WINDOW... watching them 
through the glass.  
INT. OBSERVATORY CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
 Augustine’s typing some coordinates into a computer.  The 
screen looks like some type of flight plan.  Iris is peering 
through a smaller telescope aimed at a blank wall.  
Augustine’s WATCH BEGINS BEEPING.  
Iris’ head spins toward the sound.  Augustine taps the watch, 
silencing it.  He just looks at it.  
33.
 AUGUSTINE
 Shit.  
Augustine rises... starts walking out of the observatory.  
Iris follows.  Augustine looks back.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 This I do by myself.  
(points)
 You stay here.  And don’t break 
anything.    
Iris just stares up at Augustine with her big, innocent eyes.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Here.  Or go to your room or 
something.  
Augustine turns... continues walking.  And of course Iris 
continues following.  Augustine sees her, just GROANS... 
keeps walking.  
INT. COMPOUND MEDICAL ROOM - NIGHT
 Augustine drops into the chair, rigging himself up for 
another round of chemo.  
Iris watches curiously as Augustine plugs the IV line into 
his chest port.  
AUGUSTINE
 I know.  Doesn’t make much sense to 
me either.  
Augustine settles in... doesn’t turn on any music this 
time... just watches Iris move around the room, pulling 
medical supplies from drawers... climbing on the scale.
 AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 There’s no rule that you have to 
touch everything.  
Iris makes her way around the room, back to the LIGHT SWITCH, 
where she begins clicking it off and on... the room going 
dark, then light again... repeating.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 No more.  
Iris keeps clicking.  
34.
 AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 (harder)
 I said cut it out.  
(snaps his fingers)
 My God.  Leave it alone.  
Iris stops.  The room’s dark.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Go take a nap or something.  Have a 
little respect for the dying. 
Jesus.    
Iris eases back toward the center of the room, her head 
craned upward... staring through that glass ceiling toward 
the star-filled sky beyond. 
Augustine watches her a moment, then-
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Polaris.  
Augustine points upward.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Right there.  The brightest one.  
You see it?  
Iris’ eyes follow Augustine’s finger.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 That’s Polaris.  Most important 
star in the sky.  If you’re ever 
lost, it’ll always help you find 
your way.  
Iris stares up... smiles... holds her arms out, and begins to 
slowly turn beneath them... letting all those stars just wash 
over her.  
Augustine watches her a moment, but he doesn’t smile... just 
watches... until he closes his eyes.  
EXT. CANARY ISLANDS - DAY
 FLASHCUT TO:
 The giant silver globe of the GTC TELESCOPE perched along the 
coast.  
Jean stands along the cliffs, wearing shorts and a t-shirt.  
A 30-Something Augustine approaches from the GTC.  
35.
 AUGUSTINE
 I called your cell.  You didn’t 
answer.  
JEAN
 Sorry.  Was just thinking.
 AUGUSTINE
 You can’t answer your phone when 
you’re thinking?  
JEAN
 I can.  I just didn’t.  
AUGUSTINE
 What’s wrong?  
JEAN
 What color is the water? 
Augustine begins to turn to glance over the cliffs, but Jean 
holds his head... keeps his eyes locked on her.  
JEAN (CONT’D)
 Without looking.  What color?  
Augustine hesitates... isn’t thrilled with whatever game Jean 
is playing.  
AUGUSTINE
 Blue.  
Jean’s lips curl into the slightest, sad smile as she 
releases him.  Augustine looks down to the STUNNING GREEN 
WATER rolling onto the beach.  
JEAN
 The river behind us.  When it’s 
high after the rains... it sounds 
like thunder.  It’s beautiful.  
Augustine turns... sees the river winding from the hills.  
JEAN (CONT’D)
 But you’ve never heard it.  
(looking up)
 You’re so focused on what’s up 
there, that you’re blind to all the 
things around you.  To everything 
that really matters.  
AUGUSTINE
 Up there is all
 that matters.  You 
used to know that too.  
36.
 Jean gives the hint of a nod.  
JEAN
 I’m sure you’re right.  
(half-smiles)
 You always are, Augustine.  
AUGUSTINE
 If this is about the baby... the 
pregnancy.  I’m sorry, but there’s 
no room in our life for that.  The 
work’s too important.  That’s the 
only reason I said to end it now... 
to
JEAN-I’m not pregnant.  You’re safe.  
It was just a... possible sighting 
of a life form that ultimately 
proved false.  
A LONG BEAT, then-
JEAN (CONT’D)
 You want to be an explorer, 
Augustine.  To discover new worlds.  
To give life some hope.  But while 
you’re doing all that, your own 
life is just slipping away.  And 
that breaks my heart.  
Jean turns... starts walking away.  
JEAN (CONT’D)
 And that’s why I didn’t answer the 
phone.  
Augustine watches Jean leave.  He could call out to her... if 
he did, she’d probably turn around.  But instead, he just 
looks back to the green water below... then to the horizon... 
the hint of the moon appearing in the darkening sky.  
THAT’S WHEN SOMEWHERE A LITTLE GIRL SCREAMS.  
INT. COMPOUND MEDICAL ROOM - NIGHT
 CUT TO:
 Augustine awakens in the chair.  Sees Iris staring up, 
CRYING... as LOUD THUDS RUMBLE ABOVE THEM...
 ...and Augustine looks up... sees TWO DEAD GULLS on the glass 
ceiling... another falls... THUD... 
37.
 blood sprays over the window... THUD... THUD... falling 
faster... louder... as if it’s raining dead birds...
 ...and Iris jolts and cries with each strike.
 Augustine stares up, confused... starts unplugging from the 
chemo unit.  
EXT. BARBEAU OBSERVATORY COMPOUND - NIGHT
 The snowy ground is dotted with dead birds of all sizes.  
A compound door opens... Augustine steps outside, wearing an 
OXYGEN MASK, and carrying a DIGITAL AIR-CONTAMINATION 
DETECTOR in his mittened hand.    
The Detector BEGINS TO BEEP... QUICK AND STEADY... the gauge 
bouncing along the fringe of red.  Not good.  
INT. OBSERVATORY CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
 Augustine’s at a computer.  Iris stands beside him, staring 
at that same INFRARED WORLD MAP on the monitor screen... 
watching as a deep red covers almost everything. 
AUGUSTINE
 It shouldn’t be this far north... 
not yet.  Unless it’s worse than 
everyone...  
(without looking at Iris)
 I can’t keep you safe here.  
INT. OBSERVATORY CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
 Augustine’s back at the radio.  Iris stands at the 
chessboard, randomly moving the pieces.  
AUGUSTINE
 Repeat.  This is Barbeau 
Observatory.  Is anyone receiving?  
(static, changes channel)
 Barbeau Observatory.  Confirm 
reception.  
More static... seems even louder now... more hopeless. 
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Goddammit!
 Augustine angrily shoves the radio unit off the desk.  
38.
 Iris drops the chess piece... spins to the noise.  
Augustine sits there, a little out of breath... thinking.  
Then his eyes SETTLE ON A TOPOGRAPHIC MAP hanging on the 
wall.  
Augustine walks to it... runs his hand along the map.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Up here.  Lake Hazen.  There’s a 
weather station.  
Iris drags a chair over... climbs up for a better view beside 
Augustine.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 They’ve got a radio system... 
antenna stronger than ours.  
(beat)
 If we could get there... it’s a 
long way.  I don’t know if I...
 (spirits sinking)
 It’s too far.  
Iris runs her tiny hand randomly over the map... feeling 
it... moving from point to point.  Augustine watches her.
 AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 But with a sled... enough supplies.  
(beat)
 It’s north... protected by this 
mountain range here.  The air might 
still be good.  At least for a 
little longer.      
Augustine keeps staring at the point on the map... nodding... 
becoming more sure of this idea.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 We get to that antenna... 
somebody’ll hear us.  
Then he gently moves Iris’s hand to Lake Hazen.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 We have to take a trip.  
INT. BARBEAU OBSERVATORY COMPOUND - HANGAR - NIGHT
 Augustine tears a tarp off a SNOWMOBILE.  He tries to crank 
the engine... just CLICKS.  He opens the hood... stares down 
at the engine... his breath heavy behind the oxygen mask.  
39.
 He moves around the machines and tool chests... wheels a 
BATTERY CHARGER over... begins connecting the cables... then 
coughs... harder... blood spatters across his mask.    
AUGUSTINE
 Son of a bitch.  
(beat)
 Who are you kidding?  
He just stands there a moment... ready to turn... to walk 
out.  But instead, he goes back to connecting the cables.  
INT. COMPOUND - AUGUSTINE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
 Augustine gathers gear into a backpack... opens the 
nightstand drawer, dumping the pill bottles and photographs 
in with the rest.  
INT. COMPOUND HALLWAY - NIGHT
 Augustine stands in the Medical Room doorway, staring at the 
chemo unit... the chair.  Iris walks up beside him.  
AUGUSTINE
 Can’t fit that in my pack.  
(beat)
 No point now anyway.  
Augustine and Iris walk away together.  
INT. OBSERVATORY CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
 Augustine gathers some PAGES FROM THE PRINTER.  Then he and 
Iris stand at the center of the room.  Augustine’s looking 
over it all... the telescope... the images on the computers.  
This room is his life.  
AUGUSTINE
 Everything I know is here.  Never 
expected to leave it.      
Augustine looks down at Iris... maybe second-guessing his 
plan.  He finally nudges her toward the door.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 What the hell have you gotten me 
into?
 Augustine shoves the pages into his backpack as they walk 
out.  
40.
 INT. COMPOUND ENTRY - NIGHT
 Augustine kneels in front of Iris, pulling a knit cap over 
her ears... zipping up a too-big winter coat.  
AUGUSTINE
 Unless you’ve got a suitcase you 
wanna tell me about, this is the 
best I could find lying around.  
Augustine slides a small oxygen tank into Iris’ coat 
pocket... runs the mask up, strapping it around her nose and 
mouth.  She tries to push it away, but he holds it firm.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 You have to.  
Augustine slips his own mask on.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 So do I.  See.  
Augustine turns the nozzle of Iris’ tank.  The HISS of air 
flowing into her mask.  She startles at the burst of cool air 
against her.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 It’s okay.  Just breathe.  
Augustine takes a deep breath into his mask.  Iris takes a 
small one... then larger... smiles.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Not so bad, right?  Don’t take it 
off.  No matter what.   
(motions to her mask)
 Never off.  
Augustine stands... looks out the door.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 We ready?  
Iris reaches her tiny hand up, taking Augustine’s.  He looks 
down, almost surprised.  Then-
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Here we go.  
Augustine pushes the door open. The Arctic air hits them.  
They step out into it.  
41.
 EXT. BARBEAU OBSERVATORY COMPOUND - NIGHT
 Augustine and Iris walk through the snow toward the waiting 
snowmobile.  There’s a large sled attached, stacked with 
supplies, tent, gasoline cans, rifle, observatory gear.   
Augustine helps Iris on, then slides aboard in front of her.  
AUGUSTINE
 Hold onto me.  
Iris doesn’t move.  Augustine presses the starter button... 
the snowmobile ROARS TO LIFE... and Iris immediately wraps 
her arms around Augustine’s waist.  
Augustine turns the throttle... the snowmobile lurches 
forward... moves slowly across the grounds.  
Augustine stops beside a LARGE STEEL POLE.  He reaches up, 
opening a POWER BOX... pulls the lever, and THE ENTIRE 
OBSERVATORY GOES DARK.  
Augustine throws a last look over the shadowy silhouettes 
painted on the white snow, then twists the throttle... the 
snowmobile carries them into the darkness. 
INT. OBSERVATORY CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
 Looking out through a frosty window.  A finger-drawn rocket 
ship flies toward a distant planet.  Beyond the drawing, we 
can see Augustine and Iris driving away. 
INT. AETHER SPACECRAFT - LITTLE EARTH - SPACE
 ANGLE ON A MONITOR... TWO TWIN BOYS IN MATCHING SOCCER 
JERSEYS fill the screen, excitedly talking over each other in 
Russian... recounting their most recent win, as their MOTHER 
smiles behind them.   
Then we see Ivanov in a chair, holding a REMOTE as he watches 
the video.  His face is emotionless... almost as if he’s 
staring at a blank screen.  
The Twin Boys playfully push at each other to get center 
stage as they talk.  Their Mother’s smile turns into a 
WONDERFUL LAUGH.  
Ivanov rewinds the video... it plays out again... that smile 
turning into a laugh.  --IN THE KITCHEN AREA... Sully, Devi, and Thebes eat... Sully 
watching Ivanov.  
42.
 THEBES
 He’s going back to the early 
ones... watching them over and 
over.  
SULLY
 I can’t imagine what he’s feeling.  
The not knowing.  
THEBES
 At least the unknown allows some 
hope.  Something to hang onto.  
DEVI
 I keep thinking about my sister and 
her kids... what might be 
happening... how much I’d like to 
see them.  See anyone.  Even my ex, 
and I hate him.   
THEBES
 (to Sully)
 Who’s the first person you’d want 
to see back home?  
Sully considers the question, then half-grimaces and shakes 
her head.  
SULLY
 Think I’m sort of a lousy human 
being.  Haven’t fostered a lot of 
deep meaningful relationships.  
(shrugs)
 But I guess that’s why I’ve never 
been afraid during a launch... 
never felt like I was risking 
anything... leaving anyone behind.  
DEVI
 That’s sad.  
SULLY
 Is it?  I honestly don’t know.  I 
mean my mother was everything to 
me.  She taught me about the stars.  
Taught me to be curious.  Pushed me 
to join the program.  But then she 
got sick... and it all went so bad 
so fast.  When she was gone it was 
like... screw it, let’s fly.  Was 
nothing left for me down there.  
THEBES
 43.
 I kind of get it.  I used space to 
leave my wife years before she left 
me.  
(off their looks)
 Our daughter... she drowned when 
she was three.  
DEVI
 God.  I’m sorry.  
THEBES
 We couldn’t get past it.  Or maybe 
just I couldn’t.  
SULLY
 All this time squeezed together up 
here, and you’ve never told us 
that.  
THEBES
 No point.  It was so long ago.  
DEVI
 I thought you were just split up 
like every other couple I know.  Do 
you guys have any other children?  
THEBES
 (shakes his head)
 Grace... my wife... she wanted to 
try again, but I... 
(shrugs)
 ...it’s like those people who as 
soon as their dog dies, they run 
out and get another one just like 
it.  Never made sense to me.  How 
can you just replace something you 
loved with every ounce of your 
heart?   
(beat)
 So instead I ran away.... took any 
mission I could find.  Stayed above 
the earth as much as possible. Then 
once after returning home, I walked 
into our house and my wife was 
gone.  And part of me was happy.  A 
house can only hold so much 
sadness.  
DEVI
 That kind of thing... you still 
have to carry it with you.
44.
 THEBES
 (nods)
 But I try to narrow my focus onto 
only what I’m doing and nothing 
else.  If I’m gathering data, I 
only think of the data.  Reading a 
book, I only think of the words on 
the page. When I brush my teeth, I 
think of only brushing my teeth.  
(beat, smiles at them)
 And when none of that works, I talk 
to you.  
Sully offers a sad smile... drops a hand on Thebes’.  She 
looks over to Ivanov’s monitor... the faces and voices of his 
perfect, happy family... being rewound... played again.    
SULLY
 Lotta broken pieces flying around 
up here.  
Thebes nods... walks over to the couch... turns on the tv and 
video game.  
THEBES
 Ivanov, let’s go.  
Ivanov just keeps watching his family video.  
THEBES (CONT’D)
 Come on.  I’ve been practicing.  
Ivanov watches another moment, then finally turns off his 
monitor... grabs a game controller and falls onto the couch 
beside Thebes.  
SULLY
 (to Devi and herself)
 And when you play the game, think 
of nothing but the game.  
INT. AETHER - FLIGHT DECK - SPACE
 Harper’s at a computer, running diagnostics on the engines.  
Sully floats in.    
SULLY
 Why don’t you have a family?  
HARPER
 (without looking up)
 Jesus.  How are things in the comms 
pod, Mission Specialist Sullivan?  
SULLY
 45.
 I mean you’re pretty old.  Did you 
ever even consider it?  
Harper shoots Sully a glance, then shakes his head as he 
continues working.  
HARPER
 I hate kids.  The noise... smells.  
Who the hell wants that?    
SULLY
 Billions of people.  Literally.  
HARPER
 Did I miss the slideshow of all 
your little monsters runnin’ 
around?   
SULLY
 I know.  It’s weird.  I never 
really thought about it before.  
HARPER
 That’s because people who want to 
read bedtime stories or coach 
Little League don’t spend two years 
at a time five hundred million 
miles from home.  
SULLY
 Ivanov does it.  
HARPER
 Alexy’s an asshole.  He’d be the 
first one to tell you.  The only 
way his wife doesn’t kill him is 
for him to spend ninety percent of 
their marriage in space.  
They sit there in silence for a moment, then
HARPER (CONT’D)
 Strange time to start wishing you 
had someone waiting for you down 
there.  
SULLY
 I’m not. 
Sully starts floating back out.
46.
 SULLY (CONT’D)
 More just wondering why I never 
have.  
Harper watches Sully drift back down the circular hall.
 INT. AETHER - SULLY’S ROOM - SPACE
 Dark.  Sully in bed... can’t sleep.  Her curtain flutters... 
Devi stepping inside.  
SULLY
 (whispering)
 Hey.  
Devi moves close enough for Sully to see her eyes are red and 
wet from crying.  
DEVI
 I keep going through all the 
possible explanations.  Thinking 
through every scenario.    
(beat)
 There’s only one logical answer.  
A moment, then Sully slides back on her bunk so that Devi can 
climb up beside her.  Sully runs a gentle hand over Devi’s 
hair... tucks it behind her ear.  
DEVI (CONT’D)
 I want my two years back.  I want 
to spend it surrounded by my 
family.  Laughing with my sister.  
Arguing with my father.  Driving an 
old van across Ireland.  I want to 
spend it falling in love.  
(beat)
 Not wasted up here.  Where nothing 
we did mattered.  
SULLY
 We don’t know that yet.  It’s like 
Harper said, we have to keep doing 
our jobs... and hoping it’s all 
going to be okay.  
A LONG BEAT, then-
DEVI
 Are you afraid?  
ANOTHER BEAT.
47.
 SULLY
 Yes.  
Then they both close their eyes... hope for sleep.    
WE PUSH SLOWLY IN ON SULLY’S EYES... TIGHTER... TIGHTER... 
AUGUSTINE (V.O.)
 You awake?  
...and the eyes open... and we realize THEY BELONG TO IRIS.  
EXT. ARCTIC WILDERNESS - NIGHT
 Augustine stands beside the snowmobile, filling the tank with 
a gas can.  Iris blinks herself awake... immediately touches 
her oxygen mask. 
AUGUSTINE
 It’s okay.  You’re still covered.  
Augustine finishes with the gas can... holds out the Air
Contamination Detector for Iris to see.  The gauge is now 
between YELLOW AND GREEN.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 And levels are down.  See.  Almost 
green.  We could probably take ‘em 
off, but better safe.  
(touches his mask)
 Not much longer.  
Augustine stows the gas can back on the sled.  A GUST OF WIND 
WHIPS ACROSS... throws a wave of icy powder over them.    
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Turn away from it.  
Augustine steps up between Iris and the wind... turns her 
body to face the other direction.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Let the jacket do the work.  
The wind finally lightens.  Iris turns back around toward 
Augustine.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 You’re tired?  
Augustine tilts his head over, closing his eyes.  
48.
 AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Sleepy?  
Iris nods.  
Me too.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Augustine looks back to the Detector, then squints out across 
the tundra... sees the SHAPES OF TWO ARCTIC WOLVES WATCHING 
FROM ALONG A RIDGE.      
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Just need to go a little further.  
Augustine climbs back onto the snowmobile... starts the 
engine... pulls off across the snow.  
Iris buries her face into Augustine’s back, shielding herself 
from the winds.  
EXT. ARCTIC WILDERNESS - NIGHT
 An orange tent is set up in the middle of endless tundra.  A 
lantern inside makes the tent glow like a single orange bulb 
floating on a white sea.  
INT. TENT - NIGHT
 Iris is sitting up inside a sleeping bag, eating a protein 
bar, as she stares at the DETECTOR UNIT in her hand... LEVELS 
ON THE EDGE OF GREEN.  
Augustine arranges his gear... rests the HUNTING RIFLE beside 
his sleeping bag.  
AUGUSTINE
 (off the Detector)
 We’re okay for now.  Don’t need to 
keep checking it.  
Augustine reaches for the Detector, but Iris holds tight.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 We’re safe here. 
(inhales deep)
 Good air.  Safe.  
The deep breath makes Augustine COUGH... harder... then 
GROANS A LITTLE.  
49.
 AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 At least you are.  
Augustine digs his pills from the backpack... empties a 
couple into his hand... tosses them back, then notices Iris 
watching him with nervous eyes.    
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Don’t worry.  Not gonna die on you 
yet.  
Augustine moves stiffly into his sleeping bag... his body 
hurts.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Just feels like it.  
He settles in... closes his eyes.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Rest for a few hours.  Then we can 
start moving again.  
He lies there... can hear the CRUNCHING OF IRIS’S CHEWING.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 That’s a good bar, huh?  
More CRUNCHING.  Augustine opens his eyes... sees Iris just 
staring down at the Detector as she chews.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Maybe chew a little faster.  See if 
we can’t get this over with.  
Iris’ chewing doesn’t alter... the same constant crunching 
and grinding.  
Augustine finally reaches over, snatching the Detector away.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 I told you we’re fine.  You don’t 
need stare at it all night.  
Iris’ eyes fill with tears.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 You need to sleep.  I need to 
sleep.  That’s the only way we’ll 
make it where we need to go.  
Augustine shuts off the lantern... the tent goes dark... we 
can barely make out their shapes in the tiny space, when... 
CRUNCH... then-
50.
 AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Goddammit.  
EXT. ARCTIC SKY - NIGHT
 A shooting star blazes across the sky... fizzles out just 
above the horizon.  
EXT. ARCTIC WILDERNESS - TENT - NIGHT
 The wind still gusting.  Iris appears, sneaking out of the 
tent, carrying the Detector Unit.  She slides her oxygen mask 
over her face, then starts walking... holding the BLINKING 
Detector ahead of her... letting it guide her to clean, safe 
air.  
She looks up... to POLARIS shimmering above... veers her 
course to follow.  
EXT. ARCTIC WILDERNESS - NIGHT
 Iris leans into the wind, still holding that Detector out in 
front like a guide.  She walks with high knees to traverse 
the deep snow.  
The Detector BEEPS... the gauge SOLID GREEN.  Iris tugs the 
mask from her face... BREATHES... smiles.  
Then an O.S. GROWL.  Iris looks back... sees THOSE TWO WOLVES 
FROM THE RIDGE... frozen a few yards away... glowing eyes 
locked on her.  
Iris spins, the Detector slipping from her hands as she 
starts running through the snow.
 The Wolves leap in pursuit... bounding after Iris.  
Iris stumbles face first into the snow... throws a frightened 
glance back as she scrambles back to her feet...
 ...the Wolves are almost on her now.  
Iris tries to run again... falls again... and the Wolves 
leap.
 SLAM TO:
51.
 INT. TENT - NIGHT
 Augustine awakening from his dream with a start.  Sees HE’S 
STILL HOLDING THE DETECTOR UNIT.  
Then he looks to the mound of Iris’ sleeping bag... touches 
it... Iris is gone. 
AUGUSTINE
 Shit.  
Augustine scrambles up, grabbing the rifle as he hurries out 
of the tent.  
EXT. ARCTIC WILDERNESS - TENT - NIGHT
 Augustine charges from the tent... immediately freezes... 
because Iris is sitting just beside the tent...  
...staring off at the incredible AURORA BOREALIS FLOWING 
THROUGH THE SKY... dancing streams of green, purple, and blue 
lights.  
Iris looks at Augustine, a huge smile covering her face.  
Augustine catches his breath... relaxes... rests the rifle 
against the tent, then sits down in the snow next to Iris... 
shares the view.  
After a moment, Augustine turns his eyes from the incredible 
beauty... and watches Iris gazing up, in awe.  
EXT. ARCTIC WILDERNESS - NIGHT
 FROM HIGH ABOVE... the snowmobile is like a dot moving across 
a white world.  
EXT. ARCTIC WILDERNESS - NIGHT
 ON ARCTIC HARES... BOUNCING STRAIGHT UP HIGH IN THE AIR. 
The snowmobile glides over the snow.  Augustine pointing 
toward the Hares as they pass.  
AUGUSTINE
 (yelling back to Iris)
 Arctic Hares!  They jump up instead 
of out!  So they can see further!  
Iris just grins as she watches the pogo-hopping animals.    
52.
 EXT. ARCTIC WILDERNESS - NIGHT
 The snowmobile stopped... idling.  Augustine as binoculars 
raised... peering off toward a GRAY SHAPE in the distance.  
AUGUSTINE
 I’m not sure.  
Augustine hands the binoculars to Iris.  She looks toward the 
shape.
 AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Hang on.  
Iris grips onto Augustine as he turns the throttle... head 
toward that distant shape.  
EXT. ARCTIC WILDERNESS - CRASHED PLANE - NIGHT
 A PRIVATE JET rests tilted in the snow.  One wing severed 
off, with a flapping tarp over the gaping hole left behind in 
the fuselage.  
The wind has blown deep drifts against one side of the plane.  
There’s some loose luggage and supplies scattered in the 
snow.  
The snowmobile pulls up.  Augustine and Iris look over the 
scene.  
AUGUSTINE
 Trying to find a safe zone.   
(beat)
 Storm or ice might’ve brought them 
down.  Or they just left too late.  
Then Augustine climbs off.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Stay here.  
(hard)
 Here.  I mean it.  
Iris understands... nods.  
Augustine pulls the rifle and flashlight from the sled... 
moves toward the downed plane.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Hello?!  
No answer.  Augustine reaches the tarp... grabs a flapping 
corner... opens it to peer in.  
53.
 AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Hello?  
Augustine steps inside.  
INT. PRIVATE JET - NIGHT
 Augustine’s flashlight beam floats over the wreckage... 
shredded steel... seats torn from their moorings... the 
charred remains of a small campfire on the floor.  
Augustine makes his way to the cockpit... the FROZEN CORPSE 
OF THE PILOT still strapped into the seat.  Another tarp 
hangs over the shattered windshield.  
TOOLS rest beside the RADIO UNIT.  
Augustine moves back past that flapping tarp... toward a PILE 
OF SHEET-COVERED SHAPES.  
Augustine hesitates... already knows what he’s going to find 
before he pulls back the sheet... reveals the FROZEN BODIES 
OF A FAMILY... a MOTHER and THREE CHILDREN.
 And that’s when a GLOVED HAND SUDDENLY GRABS AUGUSTINE’S 
ANKLE.  
Augustine jumps with a start... aims the light down onto 
WHAT’S LEFT OF THE FAMILY’S FATHER... frozen streams of blood 
from his frostbitten ears and nose.  All the fingers on his 
other UNGLOVED HAND are black.    
The Father makes a GUTTURAL BARK... a desperate plea for 
help.    
MOVEMENT from the front of the plane... Iris staring at the 
scene, wide-eyed.  
AUGUSTINE
 I told you to stay outside!  
Iris is too stunned by the scene to move.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Now!  Get the hell out!!  
Iris rushes back out through the tarp.  
Augustine looks over the bodies, then back down to the 
Father.  The man’s still gurgling... trying to speak.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 I’m sorry.  
54.
 Then Augustine turns off the flashlight... steadies the rifle 
in his hands...
 ...as WE DRIFT BACK TOWARD THAT FLAPPING TARP... the wind 
beating it against the fuselage when the GUNSHOT RINGS OUT.  
EXT. PRIVATE JET - NIGHT
 Augustine walks outside.  Iris stands between him and the 
snowmobile.  Her eyes are filled with tears.  Augustine slows 
beside Iris... rests a hand on her head... starts to speak, 
but instead just continues walking.    
He stores the rifle and flashlight back on the sled, then 
notices something in the distance... THE TWO WOLVES... 
watching from across the tundra.  
Augustine gazes back at them a moment, then pulls one of the 
gas cans from the sled... carries it back toward the plane.  
EXT. ARCTIC WILDERNESS - NIGHT
 The Wolves... standing on a ridge... watching the snowmobile 
drive across the tundra...
 ...as behind it, FLAMES POUR OUT OF THE PLANE, devouring 
everything inside.  
INT. TENT - NIGHT
 The lantern glowing.  Augustine and Iris are beneath their 
sleeping bags.  Iris just stares up at the roof of the tent.  
Augustine watches her.  Then-
AUGUSTINE
 What you saw... that’s not going to 
happen to you.  
Iris turns to look at Augustine.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 We aren’t going to let that happen.  
They hold a look... until Iris closes her eyes.  Augustine 
turns off the lantern.  
ANGLE ON THE LANTERN BULB... GOING DARK... JUST THE FINAL 
GLOW OF THE FILAMENT DYING... THEN BLACKNESS TAKES OVER... 
FOR SEVERAL LONG MOMENTS THAT’S ALL WE SEE...
55.
 ...UNTIL THE EXTERIOR OF THE AETHER APPEARS... gliding past 
us.
 INT. AETHER - SULLY’S ROOM - SPACE
 Dark except for a reading light.  Sully’s reading a novel... 
The Left Hand Of Darkness.  It’s all quiet... until the 
CLICKING OF CARDS BEING SHUFFLED... SHUFFLED AGAIN... and a 
small smile creeps over Sully’s face.  
INT. AETHER - LITTLE EARTH - SPACE
 Sully enters.  Harper is already at the table, dealing.
 SULLY
 (half-whisper)
 I think we’re supposed to be 
sleeping.  
Sully sits down across from Harper.  
HARPER
 I’m the commander of this mission.  
How do you expect me to sleep with 
what’s been taking place?  
(off Sully’s look)
 I haven’t won a hand since we left 
K-23.  That shit stops tonight.  
SULLY
 Maybe we should change games.  You 
any better at Go Fish?
 Sully discards...  
HARPER
 Don’t patronize me.  
...and Harper scoops it up.  
HARPER (CONT’D)
 Will only make this beating you’re 
about to take worse.  
SULLY
 That sparkle in my eye.  That isn’t 
fear.  
Harper chuckles... discards.  As the game continues
HARPER
 56.
 I got into NASA because I was good 
at math.  I don’t like to use the 
word Prodigy, but
SULLY-Yeah, I read your bio.  You also 
broke the family dog’s leg when you 
tried to fly it in a wooden rocket 
you built in the backyard.    
HARPER
 That’s irrelevant.  
SULLY
 Not to the dog.  
HARPER
 Did you know there are over sixty 
billion possible combinations of 
rummy hands at the start of each 
game?  
SULLY
 (shakes her head)
 But I know there seems to be only 
one possible outcome at the end.  
HARPER
 So this little streak you’re on
SULLY-The streak that’s lasted from one 
side of the universe to the other?  
HARPER
 Is simply a miniscule blip of luck 
among sixty billion possible 
combinations.    
Harper picks up... 
HARPER (CONT’D)
 But when you apply genius level 
math skills to the game...
 ...discards.  
HARPER (CONT’D)
 ...you can shift all those 
combinations to your favor.  
Sully scoops up Harper’s discard.  
57.
 SULLY
 And that’s what you’re doing now.  
Overpowering me with math.    
HARPER
 You’re what my fellow 
mathematicians refer to as a 
Simpleton.  
Sully snorts a little laugh...     
HARPER (CONT’D)
 So I wouldn’t expect you to 
understand.  
...discards.  And Harper smiles... 
HARPER (CONT’D)
 But you’re about to.  
...reaches for the card... just as RED LIGHTS BEGIN 
FLASHING... a SIREN BLARES.  
Sully and Harper are both rising to their feet... as Ivanov 
comes charging out of his room in just a t-shirt and 
shorts... races past.  Harper and Sully drop their cards... 
follow after Ivanov.    
INT. AETHER - FLIGHT DECK - SPACE
 More red lights and sirens.  Ivanov hurries to his 
controls... starts clicking in commands.  
IVANOV
 We’ve deviated off course.  
HARPER
 How far?  
IVANOV
 Impossible to know yet.  Auto 
deactivated at some point.  
SULLY
 Related to the comms blackout?  
Ivanov doesn’t answer... just keeps clicking. 
HARPER
 Shut us down.  
(off Ivanov’s look)
 Kill the engines before we get 
completely sideways up here.  
58.
 Ivanov works the instruments... the red lights go white... 
the sirens quiet.  
Thebes and Devi enter... take in the scene.  
SULLY
 Problem with auto-pilot.  
DEVI
 How does that happen?
 HARPER
 Not uncommon.  
IVANOV
 And not a problem when Mission 
Control can help us correct.  
DEVI
 So now we’re just floating out 
here.  And off course?  
(off Sully’s nod)
 How far?  
Ivanov gives an ANNOYED GRUNT... some RUSSIAN CURSES.  
HARPER
 Need to figure that out. 
THEBES
 What’s the variance for the alarm?  
IVANOV
 Zero point two degrees. 
THEBES
 The alarm sounded for what... about 
eighty seconds?
 DEVI
 At thirty-thousand miles per hour.  
HARPER
 Plus coast speed after engine kill.  
DEVI
 And guidance and telemetry are
SULLY-non existent without comms.  
59.
 IVANOV
 I suggest we don’t just hang around 
up here hoping for that to 
change... waiting for earth to 
throw us a rope.  
A LONG BEAT OF THINKING. 
THEBES
 Sully, what can you hear out there?  
SULLY
 Jupiter probes.  The beacon we left 
behind at Colony Site One on K-23.  
The supply probe on its way there 
now.  I don’t know what else... 
some dying satellites and
THEBES-ISS?  
(nods)
 SULLY
 Transmissions are dark, but I can 
pick up feint location pulses.  
DEVI
 (to Thebes)
 You can use that.  
THEBES
 (nods)
 Reference the K-23 beacon as our 
starting point.  
IVANOV
 That’s behind us.  
THEBES
 And build a course from there to 
the ISS.  
HARPER
 Close enough to earth for me.  
Start building.  
(to Sully)
 Get him exact numbers on the beacon 
and pulse.  Devi, help Thebes with 
the course design.  And move 
fast... we’re drifting while you 
work.   
The group fans out.  Harper follows... looks back to Ivanov.  
60.
 HARPER (CONT’D)
 Run internal tests to make sure 
auto was all we lost.  If we’re 
clear, we’ll re-fire once we have 
the plot.  
IVANOV
 And then what?  
HARPER
 Cross our fingers, Alexy.  Shit, 
that’s all I do half the time 
anyway.  
Harper exits... leaves Ivanov to go back to his controls.   
INT. AETHER - COMMUNICATION POD - SPACE
 Sully, Thebes, and Devi floating inside the pod.  Sully’s 
working the dials and switches... locking into a sound... a 
PING.  
SULLY
 Colony beacon.  
Thebes scribbles something into a pad.  
THEBES
 (to Devi)
 We’ll need our exact distance 
traveled from K-23.  
Devi starts floating out.  
DEVI
 I’ll pull it up.  
THEBES
 And the current orbit position.  
(to Sully)
 We can base it off the transmission 
delay speed and scheduled orbit 
position.  
(looking out the small 
window)
 Need our own guidepost.  
SULLY
 (pointing past him)
 Polaris.  We’ll go old school just 
like Magellan.   
61.
 INT. AETHER - THEBES’ LAB - SPACE
 Thebes at his laptop running course computations.  Devi’s 
looking over his shoulder.  They watch an animated line 
stretch across the mapped screen.    
DEVI
 Ten models, ten matching results.  
Thebes nods... carries his laptop from the lab.  
INT. AETHER - FLIGHT DECK - SPACE
 Ivanov’s looking over the coordinates on Thebes’ screen.  
IVANOV
 You’re sure about these numbers.  
Thebes hesitates.  
Yes.  
DEVI
 Harper looks from Devi to Thebes.  Thebes nods.  
HARPER
 That’s our course.  
IVANOV
 From this distance, it’s like 
hitting the head of pin.  If 
they’re off even a
HARPER-They aren’t, Alexy.  
Harper nods for Ivanov to lock in their course.  Harper 
crosses his fingers for him.  Ivanov GRUNTS... keys in the 
coordinates.  
HARPER (CONT’D)
 And if they are, we’ll know as soon 
as we hit Neptune.  
Harper nods to Thebes and Devi as he heads out.  
HARPER (CONT’D)
 Good work.  
62.
 INT. AETHER - LITTLE EARTH - SPACE
 Harper walks into the kitchen area... stops at the table... 
the deck of cards now spread out in a Smiley Face design.  
HARPER
 Goddammit.  
INT. AETHER - SULLY’S ROOM - SPACE
 Sully’s back in her bed, reading... 
HARPER (O.S.)
 You know that’s a win for me! 
...then smiling.  
EXT. AETHER SPACECRAFT - SPACE
 The engines BLAST... FIRE ERUPTS... WHITE SMOKE CONSUMES 
US... FOR A LONG TIME... BEGINS TO CLEAR, and WE REALIZE IT’S 
A SNOW CLOUD BEING THROWN UP FROM THE BACK OF THE SNOWMOBILE.    
EXT. ARCTIC WILDERNESS - DUSK
 The world’s a little brighter than we’re used to.   
The snowmobile tears across the tundra, dragging the sled.  
Iris clings to Augustine, her face pressed sideways against 
his back, watching the world race past... spots a few SQUARE 
SHAPES in the distance.  
Iris tugs on Augustine’s jacket... points.  
Augustine slows... squints out at the shapes... veers toward 
them.   
EXT. ARCTIC WILDERNESS - DUSK
 Three rectangle-shaped steel pre-fab pods rest at various 
angles in the snow.  There is NORWEGIAN PRINT along each 
wall.  Transportation cables are still secured around them.   
Augustine and Iris climb off the snowmobile... walk through 
the snow toward the pods.   
AUGUSTINE
 We were supposed to get these.  
More office space for the 
observatory.  
63.
 Augustine pushes open a pod door... glances around inside.  
The walls are thick with foam insulation.   
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Plans changed I guess.  
(glancing up)
 Choppers must’ve just dumped ‘em 
here.  
A CLANK from beside him... Iris opening another pod door. 
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Easy.  
Augustine joins her... enters the pod.  
INT. STEEL POD - DUSK
 Augustine and Iris glance around the empty pod.  It’s like a 
newly constructed room... open light fixtures and exposed 
electrical outlets.    
AUGUSTINE
 Would’ve been nice.  Might’ve 
actually gotten my own place to 
work.  
Augustine turns... starts back out.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Oh well.  Got it eventually I 
guess.  
(off Iris)
 For a little while anyway.  
Iris follows Augustine to the door, but stops before stepping 
back outside.  
Augustine walks a short distance, then looks back... sees 
her.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Time to go. 
Iris doesn’t budge.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 We can stop in a couple hours.  
Still nothing.  Augustine looks to the stowed tent on the 
sled, then back to Iris.  
64.
 AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 It is a helluva lot warmer inside 
there.  
(beat, nods)
 But just for one night.  
INT. STEEL POD - NIGHT
 The lantern glows at the middle of the room.  Iris is in her 
sleeping bag beside it, drawing a woman’s face... with long 
purple hair.  
Augustine sits back against a wall, chasing some pain pills 
with some whiskey from his flask.  
AUGUSTINE
 That’s pretty.  Is that your mom?  
Iris holds it up so Augustine can get a better view.  
Augustine stares at it.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 I knew a pretty face like that 
once.  Hair was a little different 
shade.  
Iris goes back to drawing.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 And she was as loud as you are 
quiet.  When she’d laugh, everybody 
would turn and look.   
Augustine smiles.
 AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 I think she laughed so much because 
she was smarter than all the rest 
of us put together.  And she knew 
it.  
(beat)
 Tell me something about your life.  
Iris scribbles in more purple hair.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Anything will do.  
(off her silence)
 Iris.  
Iris looks up.  
65.
 AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Ask me a question.  
A BEAT, then-
IRIS
 Did you love her?  
Augustine stares back in shock... wasn’t expecting to hear 
Iris speak.  None of us were.  And as Augustine stares, WATER 
BEGINS DRIPPING DOWN ON IRIS’S HEAD... then on Augustine’s 
head... harder... faster.  Until-
IRIS (CONT’D)
 We need to leave.  
INT. STEEL POD - NIGHT
 SLAM TO:
 Augustine waking from his dream... sees WATER SPRAYING IN 
FROM A COUPLE OPEN OUTLETS... HEARS LOUD POPPING FROM 
OUTSIDE... realizes the pod is TILTED AT A STEEP ANGLE, and 
he has slid down to a corner, his sleeping bag-covered legs 
submerged in a puddle of water... Iris’s drawing of the 
purple-haired woman floating beside him.    
He spins... sees the terrified Iris standing at the other end 
of the pod, holding onto a joist in the wall. 
Augustine starts crawling up the angled floor, grabbing his 
backpack as he moves... still not sure what the fuck’s 
happening.  The O.S. POPPING GROWS LOUDER.   
AUGUSTINE
 (to Iris)
 Hold on!  I’m coming!  
The pod SUDDENLY LURCHES DOWNWARD... Augustine slides back... 
Iris SCREAMS... and MORE WATER POURS IN THROUGH SEAMS.  
Augustine struggles back up the incline... reaches Iris, then 
looks out the pod door... everything’s at a crooked angle... 
twisting further.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 We’re on ice.  It’s breaking away.  
We’ve gotta jump!
 The pod shifts again.  Iris loses her grip... starts sliding 
down, but Augustine hangs onto her.  
66.
 AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 I’ve got you!  
Augustine pulls Iris back to him... 
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Hold onto me!
 ...lifts her up as much as he can, then half-tumbles from the 
sinking pod.
 EXT. STEEL POD - NIGHT
 Augustine and Iris slam to the ice as the pod sinks further 
below the surface.   
Augustine immediately looks toward the snowmobile... the sled 
sinking through a widening crack in the ice... half
submerged.  
AUGUSTINE
 (pulling Iris up)
 C’mon!
 Augustine hurries over the ice... more POPS AND CRACKING as 
the fissures from the sinking pods spread.  
Augustine throws Iris across the snowmobile, then climbs on 
in front of her... starts the engine... 
...just as the rear of the snowmobile drops... gravity pulls 
them toward the icy waters.  
Augustine guns the engine.  The snowmobile tracks churn on 
the ice... grip... lurch forward... but the ice splinters 
beneath it... the snowmobile is stuck.  
Augustine leaps off to push the machine as he guns the 
throttle... straining with everything he has to give it on 
the rapidly splintering ice...
 ...but the snowmobile keeps slipping downward into the water.  
Augustine finally releases the throttle... grabs Iris by the 
arm to yank her free... pulls her to safe ground.  
The snowmobile sinks faster into the crack.  Augustine lunges 
to grab the tent and rifle from the sled...
 ...just as the ice gives away under his weight.  He dives 
back to solid ice with Iris... slides her further away, then 
watches the snowmobile sink from view.  
67.
 AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Goddammit!  
He slams a fist into the snow.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 GODDAMMIT!!  
He catches his breath, then begins gathering his gear... 
backpack, tent, rifle, supply pack.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 We should’ve kept driving.  We 
shouldn’t have stopped. 
Augustine scans the landscape, then looks up to the stars... 
POLARIS SHIMMERING.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 We’ve gotta walk now.  
(to Iris)
 We’ve got no choice.  We have to 
walk.  
Augustine starts walking.  Iris follows right beside him, as 
the ice POPS and CRACKS behind them.  
EXT. ARCTIC WILDERNESS - DUSK
 An endless white ocean of windswept snow.  Augustine trudges 
across it.  Iris is right behind him, stepping in Augustine’s 
tracks as she follows.  
EXT. ARCTIC WILDERNESS - DUSK
 Augustine and Iris huddle against a large rock, as the wind 
whips the snow past them.  Augustine digs a protein bar from 
his pack... breaks it in half to give to Iris.  
AUGUSTINE
 All we have.  
Iris takes a bite.  Augustine shoves the remaining half back 
in the pack.  He leans back against the rock... closes his 
eyes.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 We’ll wait for the winds to die 
down.  Just for a little while.  
Iris slides up against him.  
68.
 EXT. ARCTIC WILDERNESS - DUSK
 Augustine leads Iris up a snow-covered slope.  His steps are 
slow... weak.  He drops to his knees, COUGHING... spitting up 
blood, staining the white snow.  
He remains hunched over on all fours for a moment... until 
Iris rests her small gloved-hand on his back... and Augustine 
straightens... rises to his feet... continues the climb.  
EXT. ARCTIC WILDERNESS - DUSK
 An Arctic Hare sits motionless on the ground.  Suddenly a 
GUNSHOT blasts the ground just beside it... sends the Hare 
darting away.  
Then we see Augustine standing in the distance, rifle still 
aimed.  He and Iris watch the Hare bound out of sight.  
EXT. ARCTIC WILDERNESS - TENT - NIGHT
 Iris stands beside Augustine as he sets up the tent... using 
a rock to hammer the stakes into the hard ground.  
INT. TENT - NIGHT
 Augustine hands Iris the last of the protein bar.  She holds 
it without biting.  
AUGUSTINE
 It’s okay.  I’m not hungry.  
Iris still doesn’t eat.  Augustine shakes out a couple pain 
pills... shows them to Iris.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 I like these more anyway.  
He tosses the pills into his mouth. Iris takes a tiny bite.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 There should be food at Lake Hazen.  
More than we’ll ever need.  
(beat)
 And no peas I bet.  Just the good 
stuff.  Pizza and cheeseburgers.  
The wind rustles the tent... half-lifts a corner.  Augustine 
puts his weight on it, pressing the corner stake back down.  
69.
 AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 I used to think I wanted to be an 
explorer... lead the way across new 
worlds instead of just finding them 
for others to see.  
(beat)
 Now... not so sure I was ever built 
for that.  Younger days maybe.  
Augustine drifts over until he’s lying down.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 What about you?  Are you going to 
explore when you grow up?  
(closes his eyes)
 If you do, find someone you like to 
do it with.  
Iris lies down beside Augustine... 
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 And keep ‘em beside you forever.  
...stares at his weathered face, then runs a small finger 
along a deep wrinkle... running up from the corner of his 
eye, across his forehead... down the other side.   
And Augustine’s asleep before she finishes.  
EXT. TENT - DUSK
 Augustine kneels in the snow, looking over the map.  He’s 
weak... sweating from fever... holding in coughs.  Iris 
kneels beside him.  The wind pounds against them, flapping 
the map over.  Iris grabs the edge to hold it down.  
AUGUSTINE
 We just need to stay headed in this 
same direction.  We get tired, 
we’ll take a break.  Someplace 
outta the wind.  
Augustine starts folding the tent back up.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 We’ve got to be getting
Suddenly Iris bolts away.  Augustine turns to see where... 
then realizes the WIND HAS FILLED UP THE OPEN TENT... is 
pulling it loose from the stakes.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Oh, God.
70.
 Augustine jumps up.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 I forgot to close it up!  Grab it!  
Iris nears the tent just as the last stake snaps free.  The 
tent starts rolling away like a giant orange ball. 
Augustine and Iris continue the chase, but the tent is just 
skimming across the snow... pulling away from them... finally 
POPS FULL OF WIND... lifts off into the air... 
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 NO!  
...flying away... higher... further.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Please.  
Augustine slows... can only watch it shrink in the distance.  
Iris stops running... looks back to Augustine.    
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 (beaten)
 It’s the wrong way.  And we won’t 
catch it.  I can’t catch it.      
Augustine COUGHS HARDER... drops to his knees.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 I can’t.  
The tent vanishes against the sky.  
EXT. ARCTIC WILDERNESS - DUSK
 Augustine and Iris walk, heads turned away from the wind... 
the snow blasting across them.  
Ahead of them is nothing but open, wind-swept tundra.  
EXT. ARCTIC WILDERNESS - NIGHT
 A field of scattered boulders.  
Augustine and Iris huddle beneath a rock’s overhang.  
Augustine’s digging a hole in the snow... burrowing deeper... 
using the rock and snow to protect them from the winds.  
He curls up against the rock... pulls Iris to him... unzips 
his jacket to wrap it around her.  
71.
 AUGUSTINE
 We’ll be okay.  I promise.  We’ll 
be okay.  
They squeeze together... trembling... desperately trying not 
to freeze to death.  
EXT. ARCTIC WILDERNESS - TUNDRA - NIGHT
 The winds blow... the snow swirls over the ground like white 
tumbleweeds.  
FLASHCUT TO:
 INT. CANARY ISLANDS SHACK - DAY
 The Younger Augustine stands at the edge of a kitchen table, 
staring down at a FOLDED LETTER.  Behind him there are 
PHOTOGRAPHS OF AUGUSTINE AND JEAN on the refrigerator door.  
The house feels empty.  It’s so quiet, we can hear the HUM OF 
THE REFRIGERATOR... the BOARDS CREAK UNDER AUGUSTINE’S FEET 
when he finally leans to lift the letter.  
EXT. ARCTIC WILDERNESS - TUNDRA - DUSK
 Augustine awakens, still under that rock overhang.  Snow 
pours down around him.  He blinks his bearings back, then 
looks beside him... Iris awake... shivering.  
AUGUSTINE
 We should keep moving.  Can you 
walk?  
(off her silence)
 Iris... can you walk?  
Iris manages a nod.  
EXT. ARCTIC WILDERNESS - DUSK
 Snow pouring down.  Difficult for Augustine to see more than 
a few feet ahead.  Iris follows right behind, one gloved hand 
holding onto the back of Augustine’s jacket.  
Augustine’s head is lowered... watching the ground.  He looks 
exhausted... weak.    
He stops walking... stares just ahead of him... WHERE A LINE 
OF ANIMAL TRACKS CROSS THE SNOW. 
Augustine squints ahead.  
72.
 AUGUSTINE
 I think something’s here.  
He looks around... no sign of anything.  He looks behind 
them... just in time to catch a GLIMPSE OF SHAPES DARTING IN 
THE SNOW... crossing their tracks.      
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 They’re circling us.  
Augustine pulls Iris closer... squints into the blizzard... 
catches another fleeting glimpse... a WOLF.    
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 GET OUTTA HERE!  
Augustine shakes the rifle strap off his shoulder... shakily 
aims it toward the blurred shapes.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 GO ON!  
BOOM... Augustine fires a shot.  Iris throws her hands over 
her ears.  
More glimpses of TWO WOLVES... appearing then disappearing in 
the heavy snow... still circling.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Are they really there?  
Iris doesn’t answer... just stands against Augustine with her 
hands still over her ears.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 ARE YOU REALLY THERE?!
 Augustine tries to hold his aim on the predators, but the 
snow is working against him... the wind is blowing so hard... 
and he’s so cold.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 I don’t know.  I can’t see... I 
can’t
Suddenly a WOLF DARTS STRAIGHT AT THEM... JAWS SNAPPING... 
...BOOM... Augustine’s shot buries in the ground beside the 
Wolf... sends the animal bounding back out of sight... 
...just as ANOTHER WOLF STRIKES FROM THE OPPOSITE 
DIRECTION... clamps its jaws onto Augustine’s sleeve.  
73.
 AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 GET AWAY!  
BOOM... into the ground again.  The Wolf starts its escape... 
BOOM... Augustine’s shot catches the Wolf in the hip... sends 
it spinning... YELPING from somewhere behind that wall of 
snow.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 GO ON!  
Augustine reaches to hold Iris close to him... can’t feel 
her... looks down... and realizes IRIS IS GONE.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Oh, God.  IRIS!  
Augustine starts turning in a tight, panicked circle... 
peering through the blizzard.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 IRIS!  
He scans the ground, searching for Iris’ tracks.  But there 
aren’t any.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 COME TO MY VOICE!  I’M RIGHT HERE!     
A DARK SHAPE APPEARS IN THE WHITE SNOW.  Looks like Iris... 
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 HERE!  
...then becomes THE OTHER WOLF... LEAPING... JAWS WIDE.  
Augustine’s finger instinctively pulls the trigger... BOOM... 
the Wolf SLAMS INTO AUGUSTINE... they tumble back into the 
snow... the Wolf dead beside Augustine. 
Augustine scrambles to his feet...  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 IRIS!
 ...charges headlong into the violent snow... 
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 FIND MY VOICE!  
...panicked... veering around... stumbling.  
74.
 AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 The wind’s covered your tracks!  I 
can’t follow you!  
Augustine stops... waits...
 AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 I can’t follow you.  IRIS!!  
...listens...  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Please say something.  CRY OUT!  
...strains to hear anything behind the winds.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 I’M RIGHT HERE!  
Augustine’s screaming leads to COUGHING... PAINFUL GASPS IN 
THE COLD AIR... he stands there hunched over... squinting 
into the blizzard... then begins to cry.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 I’m right here.  
Augustine drops to the snow... COUGHING... spitting up blood.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 I’m right here.  
EXT. ARCTIC WILDERNESS - NIGHT
 Augustine lies huddled on the ground, asleep... a blanket of 
snow across him.  He awakens... looks around... sees the DEAD 
WOLF a short distance away, half-covered in fresh snow.  
Augustine pulls himself up... scans the area... sees the 
TRAIL OF BLOOD from the injured wolf leading back across the 
tundra.  But there’s nothing else.  No sign of Iris.    
Augustine just stands there... finally looks beaten.
 EXT. ARCTIC WILDERNESS - LATER
 Augustine is almost sleep-walking up a slope... 
expressionless... lost... completely broken now... his body 
weak and trembling.    
He stumbles... slides back down the slope a few feet... lies 
there a moment before struggling back up... retracing the 
climb... moving further until he falls again... slides back.  
75.
 And this time Augustine doesn’t stand back up.  He just lies 
there in the snow.  Finally closes his eyes.  This is where 
Augustine dies.  
EXT. ARCTIC SKY - DAWN
 That pink blaze Augustine first sat under with the Polar 
Bear.  But it’s brighter now.  
EXT. ARCTIC WILDERNESS - DAWN
 Augustine lies in the snow.  The pink color washes over 
him... warms him.  His eyes flutter open in the warmth.  
AUGUSTINE’S POV... on the SILHOUETTE OF A FIGURE STANDING 
OVER HIM.  
IT’S JEAN.  In the same t-shirt and shorts.  
Jean leans slowly down toward us... and WE REALIZE IT’S 
IRIS... her face red from the freezing cold... lips wind
burned... her hair caked with snow and ice.  
Augustine pulls Iris to him.  
AUGUSTINE
 You’re okay.  You’re okay. 
Augustine holds her for a moment... then she helps Augustine 
to his feet.
 AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 I thought I’d lost you.  
Iris points ahead of them, then leans into Augustine, helping 
him make the climb to the crest of the hill... 
...where LAKE HAZEN AND THE BUILDINGS OF THE WEATHER STATION 
sit just on the other side.  A LARGE RADIO TOWER rises from 
one of the rooftops.  There’s a HERD OF MUSK OXEN along the 
edge of the lake.  
And right now it all looks like paradise.    
Augustine gives a weak laugh... can’t believe what he’s 
seeing.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Look what you did.  
Iris points up... and Augustine’s eyes follow... to POLARIS.  
He smiles... nods.    
76.
 AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 You’re a natural explorer.    
Together they start walking down to the compound.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Let’s see if we can’t get you 
someplace safe.  
And WE PAN BACK UP TO POLARIS... shimmering in the sky... 
then PULL BACK AND REALIZE WE’RE--

Harper moves back out.

 Sully floating... eyes closed... the waves of space crashing 
all around her.  The sounds are steady and constant... 
unchanging... until a CRACKLE... and Sully’s eyes immediately 
open.  
ANOTHER CRACKLE... LOUDER... and Sully’s head slowly rolls 
toward the radio controls, almost like she’s afraid if she 
moves too fast, she’ll make it stop.  
Then-
77.
 STATIC VOICE (V.O.)

Now Sully moves quickly... shutting off other channels... 
eliminating some of the waves... focusing on what she isn’t 
sure she really heard.  
STATIC VOICE (V.O.)
 Repeat.  This... static...

degrees north... static.  
Sully flips more switches... turns more dials.  
STATIC VOICE (V.O.)
 ...out there?  
Sully throws on her headphones... strains to hear.  But now 
that voice is gone.    
SULLY
 This is the spaceship Aether.  
Returning from Jupiter Mission.  
Can you hear me?  
Nothing for a long moment, then-
STATIC VOICE (V.O.)

INT. LAKE HAZEN - RADIO BUILDING - NIGHT
 CUT TO:
 Iris sits beside a burning wood stove.  Augustine’s at the

SULLY (V.O.)
 Repeat.  This is Mission Specialist 
Sullivan onboard the spaceship 
Aether.  
Augustine just stares at the radio... stunned to hear this 
voice.  It’s like he’s been hypnotized by it.

 Are you receiving this 
transmission?  
Augustine’s trembling hand hits presses a button.  
AUGUSTINE
 Yes.

 Lake Hazen, I can’t tell you how 
happy I am to hear your voice.

 For some reason we’ve lost contact

 Augustine leans closer to the radio... wants to hear every 
syllable.  
SULLY (V.O.)
 Do you have information on the

Augustine hesitates... not sure how to answer.
 SULLY (V.O.)
 Lake Hazen, are you there?

 Harper floats along the passage... SULLY’S VOICE GROWING 
LOUDER... 
SULLY (O.S.)

 ...as he floats closer... down the passage until he reaches 
the Comms Pod doorway... sees Sully with her headphones on... 
a blank stare on her face.  
HARPER
 Is that Mission Control?  
A tear slides down Sully’s cheek.  She hesitates a moment, 
then-
SULLY

Sully pulls the headphones plug.  
AUGUSTINE (V.O.)

details, but there’s been
A THUNDEROUS CRACK... so loud Sully cups her ears... LOUD 
STATIC FILLS THE POD.  Sully flips down the volume.  
HARPER
 What the hell was that?!
 Sully shakes her head... starts flipping switches to 
reconnect...
 ...as Harper pulls himself out into the
INT. AETHER - HALLWAY - SPACE
 Harper grips the walls, leveraging his float along the 
hallway... to the glass-domed cupola... just in time to see 
the ship’s COMMUNICATION DISH FLOATING PAST along with SMALL 
ASTEROIDS AND SHARDS OF STEEL.  
HARPER
 Goddammit!  
Harper continues along the passage.  Outside, the dish’s 
severed arm bounces across the cupola’s outer shell, then 
sways... almost like it’s waving goodbye as it drifts off 
into space.  
80.
 LOUD THUDS of the asteroids pounding against the ship.  Sully 
appears out of the Comms Pod.  
SULLY
 What is it?!
 HARPER
 Asteroid took out the comms 
antenna!
 Harper rapidly pulls himself down the ladder.  
MORE THUDS.  Sully looks up to see SOFTBALL-SIZED ROCKS 
careening off the ship.    
Sully follows after Harper.  
INT. LAKE HAZEN - RADIO BUILDING - NIGHT
 Augustine adjusts the radio channels.  
AUGUSTINE
 This is Lake Hazen.  Aether, I lost 
you.  
Static.  He adjusts again.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Mission Specialist Sullivan, do you 
read?  
Static.  Augustine just sits there a moment, then turns... 
toward Iris.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 What happened?  
Iris doesn’t have an answer for him.  
INT. AETHER SPACECRAFT - FLIGHT DECK - SPACE
 Sully enters chaos.  Harper, Ivanov, Thebes, and Devi criss
crossing the deck, frantically working instruments.  
The ship continues to SHUDDER AND BANG.    
THEBES
 Are we altering course?  
IVANOV
 That’s what I’m trying to do.  
81.
 HARPER
 Because we’re in a rock fight we 
can’t win, Alexy.  
IVANOV
 I know how to fly the ship!    
Ivanov works more controls... the POUNDING CONTINUES... THEN 
SLOWS... QUIETS.  Everyone stands frozen... listening... 
hoping.  
DEVI
 (off a screen)
 We look clear. 
IVANOV
 I’d been watching the radar all 
day.  
(to Thebes)
 Showed no debris around us for 
miles.  
THEBES
 Could be related to the same 
malfunction that hit autopilot.  
I’ll do a run.  
DEVI
 Possibly just a solar gust.  Could 
come out of nowhere.  I can check 
readouts for inconsistencies.   
HARPER
 (shakes his head)
 Stay on current to assess any 
damage beyond the comms.  
(to Sully)
 Status of secondary and tertiary 
communications?
 SULLY
 Lost everything.  
HARPER
 Son of a bitch.  
Harper starts down a passage.  
HARPER (CONT’D)
 (to Sully)
 Come with me.  
(to the others)
 Full reports on all systems.  And 
if the radar is off, fix it.     
82.
 Ivanov, Thebes, and Devi move about the flight deck, running 
instrument tests.  
INT. AETHER - COMMUNICATION POD - SPACE
 Sully and Harper floating.  Not speaking.  Sully’s looking at 
Harper, waiting for a response.  
HARPER
 No one else gets that information.  
SULLY
 They deserve to know what
HARPER-It’s one unconfirmed voice.  
SULLY
 It’s the only voice out there.  
HARPER
 Last man on earth just happened to 
stumble onto your frequency? 
Harper shakes his head... starts out.
 HARPER (CONT’D)
 We’re not creating doomsday without 
some more information.   
SULLY
 How are we supposed to do that now?  
Harper stops in the doorway... thinking.  OFF THEIR LOOKS
INT. AETHER - LITTLE EARTH - SPACE
 The crew gathered around the table.  Devi’s holding a 
tablet... running through the systems status for the others.  
THEBES
 There’s damage, but nothing serious 
enough to put us at risk.  
(looking at Sully)
 Except the communications 
satellite.  
HARPER
 What about some of the other 
exterior panels?  
(MORE)
HARPER (CONT'D)
 83.
 Possible to rewire at least some 
basic communications through 
them... rig a makeshift comms 
antenna?  
IVANOV
 No one’s been talking to us anyway.
 Sully fights the urge to look at Harper.  
HARPER
 Like to be ready when they do.  
DEVI
 I can compare schematics to see 
what might be a match.  But it’s 
unlikely.  
A BEAT, then
DEVI (CONT’D)
 The paraboloid.  
(off their looks)
 From the landing module.  Might 
give us some of the components we 
need to build an antenna.  
SULLY
 That could actually work.  And I 
should have plenty of circuit 
redundancies in the comms pod we 
can use.    
IVANOV
 How functional?
 SULLY
 The gain won’t be as high.  
DEVI
 Doubt it’ll have enough strength to 
retrieve the uplinks from the 
probes, but
HARPER-Probes aren’t a priority.  Not 
anymore.  This is all about hearing 
voices.  
SULLY
 If all we’re looking to do is get 
us a line to earth, this should 
work.  Theoretically.  
84.
 HARPER
 How long will it take to construct?  
Sully and Devi exchange a look.  
DEVI
 We can do it in three days?  Four 
on the outside?  
HARPER
 Need it in half that.  Getting too 
close to reentry point to keep 
flying blind for long.  
Sully understands... nods.  She and Devi move for the 
ladder... start climbing up.  
IVANOV
 Will require a long walk outside.  
Prep the site and install.  At 
least two people.  
HARPER
 (to Thebes)
 You reset radar?  
THEBES
 (nods)
 Appears to be working.  
HARPER
 Test it again.  Can’t have another 
surprise with anyone outside.  
Thebes heads off to work.  Harper and Ivanov sit in silence a 
moment, then-
IVANOV
 Even if this works, it just gets us 
back to the same silence.  
A BEAT, as Harper decides how to respond.  Then-
HARPER
 We’ll reach somebody.  
INT. AETHER - HALLWAY - SPACE
 Thebes and Devi rise up into the passage, floating the 
landing module’s satellite dish... guiding it along the 
passage.  
85.
 INT. AETHER - COMMUNICATION POD - SPACE
 Sully has the instrument panel taken apart... is floating 
near the floor, reaching deep inside to remove wires and 
circuits.  
INT. AETHER SPACECRAFT - LITTLE EARTH - SPACE
 The landing module dish rests on the table.  Sully’s working 
on the wiring.  Thebes hands her some wire cutters... she 
snips a line. 
Devi enters, carrying a STEEL HYDRAULIC ARM.  
DEVI
 Stole this from the LM platform 
base support.  NASA can worry about 
how to unload their supply 
canisters when we get back.  
Devi checks the arm’s fit against the back of the dish.  
SULLY
 Should do the trick.  
The Little Earth lights suddenly dim.  
THEBES
 Ship’s trying to tell us to get 
some sleep.  
DEVI
 I’m not tired.  
Sully shakes her head.  Thebes taps some buttons on a wall
tablet...
 THEBES
 Then I’ll play God.  The sun sets 
when I say so.  
...the false daylight returns.  The group continues working.  
Harper enters.  
HARPER
 How we doing?  
SULLY
 So far so good.  
DEVI
 Should come in under the deadline.  
86.
 HARPER
 Don’t cut corners though.  Needs to 
be right.  
(to Thebes)
 We’ll set the walk when you can 
give us clear skies.   
SULLY
 Who’s going out?
 HARPER
 Gotta be you and Devi.  I’ll 
probably tag along.
 (off the dish)
 Help carry that thing.  
SULLY
 In case you forgot, there’s no 
gravity out there.  Not going to be 
too heavy for us girls to handle.  
Harper shrugs... continues out of Little Earth.  
HARPER
 I don’t ever like to miss a chance 
to stroll around the block.  
Sully, Thebes, and Devi continue working.  Then-
DEVI
 Is he going because he’s worried...  
because I’ve never walked before?    
SULLY
 (shakes her head)
 You’ve trained for this.  He 
wouldn’t send you out if he wasn’t 
sure you could do it.  
DEVI
 Good.  
(beat)
 As long as one of us is.
 INT. LAKE HAZEN WEATHER STATION BUILDING - BATHROOM - DUSK
 More like an indoor outhouse.  Augustine bends over a white 
bowl, cupping handfuls of water to his face.  Then a RED DRIP 
SPLASHES INTO THE BOWL... spreads pink in the water.  
Augustine looks up to the mirror... sees the trail of blood 
seeping from his nose.  He wipes it away with a rag... 
87.
 holds the rag against it as he notices Iris standing behind 
him in the mirror’s reflection.  She looks worried.  
AUGUSTINE
 Just a scratch.  
Augustine turns... steps out toward her.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Not going to keep us from talking 
to someone again soon.  
Augustine runs his hand across Iris’s head as he passes.
 AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 Everything’s going to be fine.  
INT. AETHER - AIRLOCK VESTIBULE - SPACE
 The newly constructed comms dish rests against a wall.  
Sully, Harper, and Devi finish putting their spacesuits on.  
HARPER
 (to Devi)
 How are you feeling?  
DEVI
 I could throw up again.  
HARPER
 Do it now before you secure the 
helmet.  It’s a bitch to get off.  
Devi nods... turns... pukes.  
INT. AETHER - FLIGHT DECK - SPACE
 Ivanov and Thebes watch monitors... images of the ship’s 
exterior... the radio dish site... the airlock with Devi 
vomiting.  
THEBES
 There’s number four.  
IVANOV
 She’s so little.  Where’s it all 
keep coming from?  
INT. AETHER - AIRLOCK VESTIBULE - SPACE
 Devi stands back up.  
88.
 HARPER
 You good?  
Devi nods.  Sully slides Devi’s helmet on... begins 
manipulating it into place.  
SULLY
 We can go as fast or slow as you’re 
comfortable out there.  
Another nod from Devi.  Sully and Harper secure their own 
helmets, clip CABLES to the hooks on their suits.  
HARPER
 (to Sully)
 Goes for you too.  No rush, 
understood?  
There’s a real concern in Harper’s eyes.  Sully sees it... 
nods.  
They start gathering the dish and toolbox.  
HARPER (CONT’D)
 We clear to exit?
 INT. AETHER - FLIGHT DECK - SPACE
 Thebes studies the radar.  
THEBES
 All clear.  
EXT. AETHER - AIRLOCK - SPACE
 The airlock opens with a BLAST OF VAPOR.  Harper rises from 
the airlock first, carrying the dish with Devi.  Sully 
follows with the toolbox.  
Devi’s eyes are wide as she takes in the view.  
DEVI
 (nervous smile)
 Oh my God.  
HARPER
 No other view quite like it.  
They begin moving along the hull of the massive ship... using 
handgrips to pull across the storage tanks, radiation shields 
and solar panels... their tether floating like one long snake 
around them.    
89.
 IVANOV (V.O.)
 Installation site is just ahead.  
Twenty-five meters... twenty
meters.  Look for the ladder.    
HARPER
 See it.  
Harper leads them toward the ladder.  They climb up to the 
top of the ship... and the damaged comms antenna site.   
Harper and Devi lower the new dish to the site.  Sully straps 
tethers around the base, holding it secure to the ship, then 
uses a drill to start removing bolts from the twisted comms 
wiring panel lid... frees the lid, exposing a patch of 
severed wires.   
HARPER (CONT’D)
 Okay, guys, do your thing.  Just 
forget I’m even here.  
Sully and Devi begin working on the wires like surgeons... 
cutting and splicing.
 INT. AETHER - FLIGHT DECK - SPACE
 Ivanov and Thebes watch the monitors.  
IVANOV
 Why are
 you there, Harper?  
ONSCREEN... Harper flips the camera off with his oversized 
white glove.  
Ivanov and Thebes smile.  
EXT. AETHER - SPACE
 Sully and Devi work on the panel wiring.  Devi loses her 
wirecutters... they float away...
 DEVI
 Shit.
 ...until Harper grabs them... hands the cutters back to Devi.  
DEVI (CONT’D)
 Sorry.  Little different feel than 
training in Houston.  
90.
 HARPER
 What should be down goes up.  Just 
gotta make your brain start 
thinking backwards. 
SULLY
 Spoken by an expert in that field.  
HARPER
 Beginning to feel like I’m back in 
that asteroid storm.  Gettin’ hit 
from all sides.  
THEBES (V.O.)
 If you want a quick break, Venus 
crossing at about ten o’clock.  
Won’t get a view like this again.  
Sully, Harper, and Devi turn... watch as a magnificent orange 
planet appears... gliding across the black of space.  
DEVI
 Didn’t have those in Houston 
either.  
ANGLE ON SULLY’S REFLECTIVE HELMET MASK... Venus glowing over 
her amazed eyes.  
SULLY
 And that’s why I’m up here.  
HARPER
 Why we’re all up here.  
They stand frozen... just staring in wonder.  
INT. AETHER - FLIGHT DECK - SPACE
 Thebes enters, carrying two coffee cannisters... hands one to 
Ivanov.  
THEBES
 How are they doing?  
IVANOV
 Just locking it down.  
EXT. AETHER - SPACE
 Devi’s bent over the base, using the drill to secure the last 
of the bolts into the hull.  
91.
 Harper’s stuffing the wires into the panel box, and 
tightening the lid.  
Sully has a receiver unit connected to the new dish... 
testing the frequencies.  
POV FROM INSIDE SULLY’S HELMET... on the receiver... we can 
HEAR THE STATIC.  
SULLY
 Levels are in line.  We should be 
good to go.  
THEBES (V.O.)
 All clear to move back when you’re 
ready. 
Harper stows his tools.  
HARPER
 Devi, are we secure?  
(off Devi’s silence)
 Devi?  
Devi slowly raises up.  
DEVI
 Yes.  
HARPER
 Then let’s get back and see who 
wants to talk to us.  
Sully and Harper begin toward the ladder, but Devi doesn’t 
react.  
SULLY
 Devi?  
Nothing.  Sully and Harper move back toward Devi... see her 
dazed eyes blinking... rolling back in her head.  
HARPER
 Devi!  
DEVI
 Just a little dizzy.  
HARPER
 (to Sully)
 Get her moving.  
Sully and Harper begin pulling Devi along the hull.  
92.
 HARPER (CONT’D)
 Thebes, what are her suit readings?  
THEBES (V.O.)
 All level.  
HARPER
 They’re wrong.  
Harper’s moving faster now, propelling himself from handhold 
to handhold... floating toward the distant airlock.  
HARPER (CONT’D)
 Sully?  
I’m good.  
SULLY
 HARPER
 Get ahead of us.  Start on the 
airlock.  
INT. AETHER - FLIGHT DECK - SPACE
 Thebes is rushing into the passage as-
HARPER (V.O.)
 Have medical waiting for us.  
Carbon dioxide issue.  
EXT. AETHER - SPACE
 Sully’s racing across the ship’s hull.  We can hear her 
FRANTIC BREATHING.  
HARPER (V.O.)
 Devi!  Can you hear me?!--DEVI’S LINE GETS TANGLED ON A STORAGE TANK... jerks Harper 
to a halt.  
HARPER
 Goddammit.  
Harper instantly unclips both their tethers... is now 
floating free as he pulls Devi along the ship.  
DEVI
 (weakly)
 I’m sorry... I’m sorry.  
93.
 HARPER
 Not your fault.  No more talking.  --SULLY’s at the airlock... trying to open.  
HARPER (V.O.)
 Airlock status?
 SULLY
 Clearing for entry.  
HARPER
 We can’t wait.  
SULLY
 Won’t have to.  
That HISS as the airlock begins to open.  
INT. AETHER - AIRLOCK VESTIBULE - SPACE
 Thebes and Ivanov stand at the window peering in, as Sully 
and Harper enter with Devi.  The airlock seals closed behind 
them...
 ...and Thebes and Ivanov open their interior door to enter.    
Harper tears Devi’s helmet free.  Thebes hurries an oxygen 
mask over her face. 
HARPER
 Devi.  Breathe in!  
SULLY
 Devi!  Please breathe!  
Harper unzips Devi’s suit... grabs the DEFIB PADDLES... 
presses them to her chest. 
Sully and the others lean back... ZAP... Devi’s body arches.  
Harper checks for a pulse.  
HARPER
 Son of a bitch.  Devi!  
ZAP... Devi’s body arches again... Thebes keeps pumping 
oxygen into her until Harper finally just slumps...
 ...and Sully begins to cry... Thebes and Ivanov just stare 
down in shock.  
THEBES
 The suit read fine.  It read fine.  
94.
 Sully reaches to take Devi’s hand.  
HARPER
 Go run the comms system setup.  
SULLY
 She was my
HARPER-It’s gonna take time to get it 
working.  We still have a mission 
to finish.  
SULLY
 What mission?  I don’t even know 
anymore.  Do any of us?!
 A BEAT OF SILENCE, then-
HARPER
 Now, Sully.  
Sully wants to scream at Harper... scream at anyone... but 
instead she just moves out the door, pulling off her suit.  
INT. AETHER - COMMUNICATION POD - SPACE
 Sully sits at her station, keying in commands... flipping 
switches... getting the comms system working again.  
Then she begins to cry.  
INT. AETHER SPACECRAFT - LITTLE EARTH - SPACE
 Sully enters.  Thebes is cleaning up the waste from the dish 
build.  Harper is studying a SHIP SYSTEMS CHECK on a tablet.  
SULLY
 Should be fully online within the 
hour.  
Harper carries the tablet past her...
 HARPER
 Let me know when you’re able to 
transmit.  
...steps into his room, pulling the curtain closed behind 
him.  Sully stares after Harper a moment.  
95.
 THEBES
 He’s blaming himself.  Thinks he 
should have caught Devi’s condition 
sooner.  
SULLY
 It happened too fast.
 THEBES
 (nods)
 But that’s not how he sees it.  He 
thinks he was too worried about 
you.    
Sully’s surprised... confused.  
SULLY
 What?  
THEBES
 I might not be able to feel love 
anymore, but I still remember what 
it looks like.  
INT. AETHER - HARPER’S ROOM - SPACE
 Harper has the tablet on his desk... stands over it as he 
works.  The curtain sways open... Sully.  They just stare at 
each other moment.  
SULLY
 It was no one’s fault.  
HARPER
 My ship.  My fault.  
SULLY
 (shakes her head)
 Not this time.  
Harper’s eyes begin to dampen.  Sully steps to him... leans 
against him, resting her head against his chest.  
Harper wants to wrap his arms around her, but he isn’t sure 
how.  And before he can-
IVANOV (O.S.)
 I have our first visual on earth!  
Sully and Harper throw back the curtain... see Ivanov 
standing in a passage entrance.  He looks devastated.  
96.
 IVANOV (CONT’D)
 Worst case.  
INT. AETHER - FLIGHT DECK - SPACE
 ANGLE ON A MONITOR... the image of earth onscreen... except 
it’s not that blue ball we’re used to seeing... now the 
entire planet is covered in a thick layer of smoke.  
IVANOV (O.S.)
 I tied into the old Astron 
satellite telescope signals.   
Sully, Harper, Ivanov, and Thebes stare at the image.  
THEBES
 My God.  
IVANOV
 Definitely nuclear.  
THEBES
 At a scale no one thought possible.  
HARPER
 We all knew it was possible.  Just 
didn’t think anyone would be stupid 
enough to do it.
 Sully rests a hand on Ivanov’s shoulder.  
IVANOV
 We don’t know what’s under all 
that. 
A BEAT, then-
Yes we do.  
HARPER
 (off Ivanov’s look)
 Sully made contact just before the 
comms went down.  An Arctic weather 
station.  
(off the monitor)
 Told her about this.  About no safe 
areas left... and no one.  
IVANOV
 (to Sully)
 And you didn’t think you should 
tell us?!  
97.
 HARPER
 It was my call.  I wanted 
confirmation first.  
Rage merges with the sadness in Ivanov’s eyes... they glisten 
with tears.  
HARPER (CONT’D)
 I’m sorry, Alexy.  
Ivanov exits down the passage.  
THEBES
 If there was a voice at this 
weather station, there must be 
pockets of habitable areas.  
SULLY
 He said he’s been tracking levels.  
With the spread rate, he believes 
any clean zones are only temporary.  
Thebes considers that, then turns back to the monitor.  
THEBES
 What have we done?  
INT. AETHER SPACECRAFT - LITTLE EARTH - SPACE
 Sully enters from the passage... sees Ivanov sitting in front 
of the monitor, watching another FAMILY VIDEO MESSAGE... his 
Sons playfully fighting over center position as they tell him 
a story... while Ivanov’s Wife ducks in to blow him a quick 
kiss before disappearing from view.  
The Boys continue their excited story, then Ivanov rewinds to 
his Wife’s kiss... plays it again.  
Sully suddenly feels like she’s invaded Ivanov’s privacy... 
drops her eyes... walks out.  
INT. AETHER - COMMUNICATION POD - SPACE
 Sully swims into the pod... starts working the dials without 
strapping herself in.  Then she stops... begins to cry... for 
the world... for Devi.  She curls up in a fetal position... 
just floating.  
98.
 INT. LAKE HAZEN - RADIO BUILDING - DUSK
 Augustine sits alone at the radio desk.  He pulls some PAPERS 
AND PHOTOGRAPHS from his backpack... starts to flip through 
them when a CRACKLE OF STATIC BURSTS FROM THE RADIO.   
SULLY (V.O.)
 Lake Hazen, this is Aether.  Are 
you receiving?
 Augustine drops the photos to hit the mic button.  
AUGUSTINE
 Loud and clear, Aether.  
SULLY (V.O.)
 Nice to hear your voice again, Lake 
Hazen.  Our comms system went 
offline. 
AUGUSTINE
 With a bang.  Wasn’t sure I was 
going to get you back.    
INT. AETHER - COMMUNICATION POD - SPACE
 Sully’s strapped into her seat. 
SULLY
 We’re operational now, and just got 
a visual on earth.  Unfortunately 
it seems to confirm everything you 
told me earlier.  
AUGUSTINE (V.O.)
 Afraid we didn’t do a very good job 
of looking after the place while 
you were away.  
SULLY
 Are you seeing any new data that 
might suggest possible safe entry 
points for us?
 AUGUSTINE (V.O.)
 No.  
Sully closes her eyes... fuck.  
AUGUSTINE (V.O.)
 My best guess is all survivable 
areas are underground.  
99.
 INT. LAKE HAZEN - RADIO BUILDING - DUSK
 Augustine lifts some papers from the desk... the PAGES HE 
PRINTED OUT AT THE OBSERVATORY.  
AUGUSTINE
 So I’d like to suggest something 
else.  
INT. AETHER SPACECRAFT - LITTLE EARTH - SPACE
 Sully, Harper, Ivanov, and Thebes stand around the table, all 
staring down at a flickering tablet screen filled with math 
equations.    
SULLY
 I wrote down exactly what he told 
me.  
HARPER
 (to Thebes)
 This make sense to you?  
THEBES
 If we wanted to fly back to K-23, 
yes.  It’s a pretty genius plan 
design actually.  Deviate our 
approach toward earth, then make 
gravity our friend to save fuel on 
the turnaround.  
IVANOV
 But why would we do that?  
SULLY
 Because he’s saying there’s nothing 
left for us down there.  
HARPER
 Do we know who this guy is yet?
 A moment of Sully realizing she doesn’t know.  
SULLY
 I didn’t have a chance to ask.  
Just ran this straight in here. 
IVANOV
 It doesn’t matter.  We’re not sling
shotting our way back out into 
space.  
100.
 SULLY
 He’s sure we’ll die down there.  
IVANOV
 He’s
 alive.  How’s that possible?  
Are you talking to Superman?  
THEBES
 The Poles would be the last areas 
hit.  
SULLY
 He told me air contamination levels 
were rising at his location.  And 
he sounded sick.  
IVANOV
 We still don’t know.  Not for sure.     
HARPER
 We all saw what it looked like.  
He’s giving us an option to consi
IVANOV-Everyone dies.  And when it 
happens, I want it to be down 
there.  Not here.  
(walks away)
 Not here.  
A BEAT, then-
HARPER
 How long before we have to make a 
decision?  
THEBES
 To adjust from the current course 
to this... and keeping our speed 
up... no more than a few hours.  
Harper looks to Sully, then walks out.  
INT. MAUNA KEA OBSERVATORY - DAY
 High tech facility.  A BEARDED Augustine peers into a 
telescope.  He’s eight years older than the last time we saw 
him.  
He raises up from the telescope to scribble some notes... 
stops... because he’s just noticed Jean standing in the 
doorway.  She waves.  
101.
 EXT. MAUNA KEA OBSERVATORY - DAY
 The domes perched high atop the island of Hawaii... above 
everything.  A thick carpet of clouds surrounds the peak.  
JEAN (V.O.)
 I was on the island, so I wanted to 
drop by and say hello.  
Augustine and Jean stand outside a dome.  Augustine’s holding 
some photographs just out of our focus... staring down at 
them.      
JEAN
 You can keep those.  
AUGUSTINE
 (as he looks at them)
 The rock I sent.  Did you tell her 
it was from me?  
Jean smiles... shakes her head.  
JEAN
 What do I keep telling you, 
Augustine?  If you want her to know 
you exist, you can do the 
introduction yourself.  
A LONG BEAT, as Augustine stares at one of the photos.  
AUGUSTINE
 This could have been different.  If 
you’d told me the truth... hadn’t 
left.  
Jean looks out over the incredible view surrounding them... 
then squints up to the sky.  
JEAN
 She would have known your name.  
That’s the only difference.  
Jean leans in to kiss Augustine’s cheek...  
JEAN (CONT’D)
 And we both know it.  
...then starts walking toward a car.  
JEAN (CONT’D)
 Enjoy the view, Augustine.  
102.
 Augustine watches Jean climb into the car... pull away.  Then 
he looks out at the clouds... then back to the photographs.
 POV FROM BENEATH AUGUSTINE... and we can see that INK
SCRIBBLED 2008 on one of the photographs.  
EXT. LAKE HAZEN WEATHER STATION - DUSK
 The sky is brighter... almost feels like day.  
SULLY (V.O.)
 Repeat. Lake Hazen, this is Aether.  
Are you still picking this up?  
INT. LAKE HAZEN - RADIO BUILDING - DUSK
 Iris kneels in a chair, wearing that yellow dress.  She uses 
the radio desk for leverage to spin herself around in 
circles.  
SULLY (V.O.)
 Are you there, Lake Hazen?  
Augustine moves slowly... weakly... across the room to the 
radio... eases into the chair... taps the mic. 
AUGUSTINE
 I’m here, Aether.    
INT. AETHER - COMMUNICATION POD - SPACE
 Sully strapped into her seat.  She isn’t wearing her 
headphones.  
SULLY
 I thought I might’ve lost you.  
AUGUSTINE (V.O.)
 Not yet.  Were you able to run the 
numbers on the course correction I 
gave you?     
Sully looks beside her... and we see Harper is in the pod 
also.  
HARPER
 Lake Hazen, this is Aether Flight 
Commander Gordon Harper.  Your 
numbers are intriguing.  
(MORE)
103.
 HARPER (CONT'D)
 But they make me curious where you 
came up with them and how you know 
so much about our flight plan.  Who 
exactly are you?  
A LONG BEAT, then-
AUGUSTINE (V.O.)
 Augustine Lofthouse.  
Sully and Harper immediately look at each other.  They know 
that name.  
AUGUSTINE (V.O.)
 And you’re on your way back from 
the planet I first saw almost forty 
years ago.  I wish I’d found it a 
year sooner... might’ve saved a lot 
of lives. 
HARPER
 Doctor Lofthouse... I’d hoped to 
meet you on our return... tell you 
all about your planet.   
INT. LAKE HAZEN - RADIO BUILDING - DUSK
 Iris has stopped spinning... just watches Augustine.  
HARPER (V.O.)
 This was definitely not the way I’d 
seen this conversation playing out.  
And I’m sorry.  
AUGUSTINE
 Nothing to be sorry for, Commander.  
What took place down here... you 
and your crew have the ultimate 
alibi.  
(beat)
 The question now is whether it will 
also be your escape plan.  
HARPER (V.O.)
 Given your location, how can you be 
certain there are no safe regions?  
In the southern hemisphere?  
Antarctica?  
AUGUSTINE
 I’ve been pulling data from every 
reachable location and following 
all map simulations.  
(MORE)
104.
 AUGUSTINE (CONT'D)
 If there is an uncorrupted area, I 
haven’t found it.  I’m sure there 
must be small temporary pockets but 
the odds of you hitting it on your 
re-entry
Augustine COUGHS... turns from the mic. 
INT. AETHER - COMMUNICATION POD - SPACE
 Sully and Harper can hear Augustine coughing.  They exchange 
a glance.  It finally quiets.  
AUGUSTINE (V.O.)
 Three years... maybe less.  The 
planet will sustain life again... 
for you to return or for survivors 
to join you.  But until that ha
More COUGHING... Augustine struggling for breath.  
HARPER
 Take a rest, Doctor Lofthouse.  
Thank you for your help... for all 
the work you’ve done.  We’ll 
discuss our options up here, and 
hopefully speak again.  
They wait for a response... just silence.  Harper leans over, 
switching off the mic.  They sit there a quiet moment, not 
looking at each other.  
HARPER (CONT’D)
 What do you think?  
A LONG BEAT, then-
SULLY
 That I’m the wrong person to ask.  
Because if we go back to earth, it 
could all end.  
(beat)
 And I’d like to have more time with 
you.  
Their eyes meet.  Then Harper reaches over... takes Sully’s 
hand.  
INT. AETHER SPACECRAFT - LITTLE EARTH - SPACE
 Sully, Harper, and Ivanov standing around the kitchen area.
105.
 IVANOV
 The mission I signed up for is 
scheduled to end on earth.  
HARPER
 If there’s a voice down there to 
trust, I feel like it’s his.  
IVANOV
 Lofthouse doesn’t know my family 
isn’t safe.  No one can tell me 
that.  
HARPER
 Alexy, we can’t guarantee a re
entry location that
IVANOV-I’d rather have a few days of hope 
than a lifetime of wondering.  
They hold a look... until Harper nods... understands.    
HARPER
 Okay.  You can use the re-entry pod 
as we slingshot.  We’ll still have 
the LM. 
IVANOV
 You can handle the flight back 
without me?  
HARPER
 I only let you hang around for the 
laughs, Alexy.  
Ivanov half-smiles... pulls Harper into a quick hug...  
IVANOV
 Then we should go work on 
programming the redirect.  Try to 
make it easy for you.   
...starts walking toward the passage.  Harper follows.  Sully 
stands there, watching them exit.  Then- 
THEBES (O.S.)
 I think I’ll go with Ivanov.      
Sully turns... sees Thebes standing in the doorway.  
THEBES (CONT’D)
 He could use a friend.  
(shrugs)
 (MORE)
106.
 THEBES (CONT’D)
 And if my ex is still down there... 
she’s alone... scared.    
SULLY
 Thebes, she’s
THEBES-I know, Sully.  But I’d like to 
talk to her if she isn’t.   
(beat)
 And my mind’s so tired from trying 
not to remember.  It could use the 
rest.
 Sully moves to Thebes... hugs him... holds him.  
EXT. SPACE 
Aether cuts across the blackness.  The smoke-engulfed earth 
is in the distance.  
INT. AETHER - FLIGHT DECK - SPACE
 Ivanov and Thebes are suited up for their re-entry.  They 
exchange hugs with Sully and Harper.  
SULLY
 (to Ivanov)
 I hope you find them waiting for 
you.  
IVANOV
 I’ll bring them up to K-23 to see 
you.  
Sully nods... but they both understand how this is going to 
end.  Another hug, then Ivanov and Thebes climb down the 
tunnel toward the re-entry pod.  
SULLY
 They’re going to be all right.  
HARPER
 I hope so.  
And us?  
SULLY
 Harper reaches down... takes Sully’s hand.  
HARPER
 We’re going to be all right too. 
107.
 EXT. AETHER - SPACE
 The RE-ENTRY POD disengages from Aether... blasts downward 
toward earth.  
INT. LAKE HAZEN - RADIO BUILDING - DUSK
 ANGLE ON A BEEPING AIR DETECTOR resting on the floor... it’s 
bouncing near the RED LEVELS.  Augustine’s hand reaches into 
frame... turns the detector off.  
Augustine sits on the floor against the wall... weak... sweat 
glistening on his face... deathly sick.  He shakes the LAST 
TWO PAIN PILLS from the bottle... tosses them into his 
mouth... lets the empty bottle roll away on its own.  
He closes his eyes... leans over to lie on the floor.  He’s 
there a few moments until the CRACKLE OF STATIC.  
SULLY (V.O.)
 ...Aether... static... receiving?
 Augustine doesn’t react.    
SULLY (V.O.)
 ...static... Hazen... static... 
Aether.  
Then Iris crouches beside Augustine... begins shaking him 
awake.  Augustine’s eyes flutter open.
 AUGUSTINE’S POV ON IRIS... wearing that yellow dress as she 
nudges him again.  
SULLY (V.O.)
 Can you hear me?  
Augustine stares at Iris a moment, then struggles for the 
strength to rise... finally does... makes his way to the 
radio... drops into the chair, and hits the mic button.  
AUGUSTINE
 I hear you, Aether.  
Iris sits up on the edge of the desk beside Augustine.  
SULLY (V.O.)
 We’re headed into an ionization 
blackout so I’m going to lose 
you...
108.
 INT. AETHER - COMMUNICATION POD - SPACE
 Sully strapped in, headphones on.  She’s fiddling with the 
gold-streaked space rock as she talks. 
SULLY
 ...but I wanted to contact you 
first.  To thank you.  Commander 
Harper and I are returning to K-23.  
AUGUSTINE (V.O.)
 I’m glad.  The rest of the crew?  
SULLY
 Captain Ivanov and Specialist 
Thebes decided on re-entry.  
AUGUSTINE (V.O.)
 They have family down here?  
SULLY
 Yes.  
AUGUSTINE (V.O.)
 Weren’t there five of you?  
Sully nods a moment before replying.  
SULLY
 Flight Engineer Devi.  She suffered 
an accident during the flight.  
AUGUSTINE (V.O.)
 I’m sorry.  
SULLY
 With everything that’s happened 
down there, just losing one person 
up here... I’m sure it seems like 
it shouldn’t matter, but it does. 
(voice cracks a bit)
 Very much.  I’m sorry... I know 
you’ve probably lost so many.  
INT. LAKE HAZEN - RADIO BUILDING - DUSK
 Augustine pulls a couple photos from the pile... looks at a 
picture of Jean.  
AUGUSTINE
 I lost everyone that mattered a 
long time ago.  Made a bargain... 
traded them for the stars.  
(MORE)
109.
 AUGUSTINE (CONT'D)
 (beat)
 Now they’re just an old man’s 
regrets.  
SULLY (V.O.)
 They shouldn’t be.  You discovered 
so much up here.  
AUGUSTINE
 I just point.  You’re the explorer.  
Tell me what it’s like... to stand 
on it.  K-23.  
INT. AETHER - COMMUNICATION POD - SPACE
 Sully smiles at the thought.  
SULLY
 It’s amazing.  The colony site... 
it feels like Colorado.  Have you 
ever been there?  To the mountains?  
AUGUSTINE (V.O.)
 Yes.  
SULLY
 The air’s so crisp.  And the planet 
has that smell...
 EXT. COLORADO MOUNTAINS - DAY
 CUT TO:
 Augustine stands in an open meadow.  Mountains surrounding 
him.  His eyes are closed as he inhales.  
SULLY (V.O.)
 ...it’s like the pine trees are 
hidden somewhere... underground... 
waiting to burst through.  
INT. LAKE HAZEN - RADIO BUILDING - DUSK
 Augustine sits at the radio, eyes closed.  
SULLY (V.O.)
 I kept looking up expecting to see 
a blue sky.  But it was orange.  
110.
 AUGUSTINE
 From the light reflecting off 
Jupiter.  
SULLY (V.O.)
 It’s so beautiful.  I wish you 
could have seen it.  
Augustine’s eyes flutter open. 
AUGUSTINE
 Lake Haven will have to do.  
SULLY (V.O.)
 How did you end up there?  
Augustine lifts a FACE-DOWN PHOTO from desk... the one with 
the 2008 scribbled on the back.  He stares at an image the 
rest of us still can’t see.    
AUGUSTINE
 Thought maybe I could help someone.  
SULLY (V.O.)
 Well you definitely did.  And thank 
you again for that, Doctor 
Lofthouse.  
AUGUSTINE
 Augustine.  
SULLY (V.O.)
 Augustine.  
(beat)
 And I’m Iris.  
Then we SEE THE PHOTO AUGUSTINE IS STARING DOWN AT... A 
PICTURE OF A SMILING IRIS IN THAT YELLOW DRESS. 
AUGUSTINE
 I know.  
A tear slips from the corner of Augustine’s eye.  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 It’s very nice to talk to you.  
SULLY (V.O.)
 Well I hope you understand how-  
STATIC... a long, constant stream.  
111.
 AUGUSTINE
 Hello?  Aether.  
(off the static)
 Iris?  Are you still there?  
Just that static.  Sully is gone.  But just in case--  
AUGUSTINE (CONT’D)
 (into the mic)
 Have a good life.  
Augustine sits there a moment, staring into the static... 
then he rests the photo back on the desk... and we realize 
IRIS ISN’T SITTING THERE ANYMORE.  He stands... walks out.  
And that STATIC KEEPS CRACKLING.
 EXT. LAKE HAZEN COMPOUND - DUSK
 Augustine walks slowly... body aching... across the 
grounds... to the edge of the lake.  He sits down in the 
snow... stares over the icy water.  It’s beautiful... 
peaceful... silent...  
...until O.S. FOOTSTEPS APPROACH... and Iris steps up beside 
Augustine... sits down in the snow beside him, wearing that 
same yellow dress.  
AUGUSTINE
 I never used to notice views like 
this.  
(beat)
 Thank you for that.  
They sit in silence a moment, then Iris tilts her head over 
to rest on Augustine’s shoulder... sharing the view together.
