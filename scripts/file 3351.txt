(ominous music)

(electricity crackling)

(upbeat music)

- [Announcer] May I have

your attention, please?

Five-11-54 from

Vegas to Sacramento

is now departing.

I'll leave this mess behind

I'm starting up again

Tonight

Oh, oh, oh

I'm jumping on

the runaway train

- [Abby] Dad, sorry I ran off.

I need a fresh start.

I'm starting up again

- [Abby] I'm done

bailing you out.

(cards flapping)

- Look your opponent in the

eyes even when you're shuffling.

- [Abby] I'm not gonna

play poker anymore.

I've always wanted

to go to college

and I've just been

accepted second semester.

I wanna live a normal

life with kids my age.

I'll call you when

I'm ready to talk.

Abby.

I'm going all the way

I am starting up again

- Hey, pal!

- Hi.

(both chuckling)

- [America] I missed you.

- I missed you so much.

- Still, I can't believe

you're finally here.

You, (laughs) um, I'm sorry.

What are you wearing?

- It's the new me.

- You good?

- Yeah.

- Yeah.

Do you wanna see our dorm?

- Yes.

- Because we're roommates.

- Yeah.

- Yes, it's so awesome.

Oh, my God.

It is so good to see you.

I feel like it's

been like months.

(upbeat music)

Yeah, the neighbors

are pretty decent.

Though, the guy

across the hall vapes

that horrendous

blueberry sh*t 24/7

and also plays

Nickelback nonstop.

- [Abby] Crazy.

- Yeah.

Also, the showers suck.

- I'm sure the

showers don't suck.

So you really

spruced up the place.

- Yeah.

You know, I just wanted to

wait for you to get here.

- What's his name?

- Shepley.

And he is so hot.

- Hm.

He doesn't have

any face piercings.

- Yeah, well, sometimes

you just wake up one day

and like pistachios.

(both chuckle)

He's really excited

to meet you though

and he is taking us out tonight.

- Oh no, Mer, I'm so tired.

- [America] No.

- I just got here, it

was a long bus ride.

I just wanna stay

here and study.

- It'll be so chill.

Catholic school will let

you off for one night.

Come on.

- No, I'm not going.

- Yes, we're going.

Take off the chastity belt

and let's go.

- No, I don't wanna go.

I have to study,

Mer, Mer!

(upbeat music)

So where are we going?

- Oh, it's a surprise.

(man panting)

- I think there's a guy,

never mind.

(crowd chattering)

- Oh, hey, oh, by the way, we

don't talk about the circle.

It's a secret.

- What's a secret?

- Exactly.

(siren wailing)

- Welcome to the bloodbath!

(crowd cheering)

Whoo!

If you're looking

for Economics 101,

you are in the

wrong f*cking place,

but if you seek the

circle, this is Mecca.

(crowd cheering)

My name is Adam.

I make the rules and

I call the fight.

Tonight, we have

a new challenger,

Eastern star varsity

wrestler Marek Young.

(crowd booing)

All right, all right.

Now, reigning champ

needs no introduction,

but because he scares

the sh*t out of me,

I'm gonna give him one.

So shake in your boots, boys,

and drop your panties, ladies.

I give you Travis

"Mad Dog" Maddox!

- Whoo!

- Whoo!

- You know, this isn't for me.

I'm gonna go back to

the dorm and study.

Hello.

(singer vocalizing)

- May I?

- Uh-huh.

- [Crowd] Travis,

Travis, Travis, Travis.

(crowd cheering)

- You ready?

You ready?

Fight!

(crowd cheering)

(fist whooshes)

(elbow thudding)

(foot thuds)

(upbeat music)

(fists whooshing and thuds)

Yeah!

(fists whooshing and thudding)

(woman screams)

(foot thuds)

(foot thudding)

- Oh, okay.

(fist thuds)

- Oh, sh*t!

(fists thudding)

- Come on, Travis!

(foot and knee thudding)

- Run it, sweet money.

- Um, excuse me.

Are you new here?

- Yeah, I.

(Marek grunts)

- [Crowd] Whoa!

- Oh, sh*t!

Get up, Travis, come on!

- Get up!

- Come on, get up!

- Get up!

(crowd cheering)

- Yeah!

(crowd cheering)

- Two-one.

- Come on, Travis.

(fist thuds)

(blood splashes)

(heart beating)

(singer vocalizing)

- Winner!

- Travis!

Travis!

(crowd cheering)

(Abby groans)

- You okay?

- Uh-huh.

- Hey, you standing here.

I don't know if

that's good for me.

I usually don't get

distracted like that.

Sorry about your

sweater, pigeon.

Whoa-ha.

Grr.

- Travis, you are

my cash cow, baby.

(crowd chattering)

- I can't take you anywhere.

(crickets chirping)

(jacket thuds)

(water splashing)

I'd like to know

who you think I am

I'm not your woman,

you're not my man

(Abby moans)

You'll part the river and

then you'll build the dam

So don't play the victim

'Cause it was all in

your hands, your hands

It was all in your

hands, your hands

- What's up, pigeon?

(Abby gasps sharply)

- [Woman] I f*cking hate you!

- [Man] Relax!

- [Woman] You didn't

come home last night.

You're a liar.

- [Man] Calm down.

- [Woman] You're a liar.

- Wow.

- [Man] What are you doing?

(cloth rips)

- Listen, Abby,

tuition payments

need to be issued

through a bank account

or a credit card.

There is accountability

to be considered,

not to mention the taxes.

- I'm in the process

of setting one up.

- [Bursar] Can't your

parents help you out?

- It's complicated.

My mom, I haven't

spoken to in years,

and my dad is not the best guy.

- I'll allow it

for this semester,

but sort yourself

out a bank account

because this will not

be happening again.

- Thank you.

Thank you, thank you, thank you.

So I talked to the

bursar this morning

and she ended up

taking the cash.

I mean, at least I'm

covered for the semester.

- [America] Oh, what happens

when the money runs out?

- I don't know.

I'll find a job or

I'll get a scholarship.

I'll figure something out.

Incoming.

- Hey, pumpkin.

I got you a coffee here.

- Thank you.

- Aw.

- [Shepley] That's for you.

- Thanks.

- How was last night?

Did you have fun?

- Yeah, it was memorable.

So what was the deal

with the one guy,

the guy that was

covered in tattoos?

- Oh, that's his cousin.

He's a sophomore.

- Oh, that guy goes to college?

- [America] Mm-hm.

- Wow, that is surprising.

- [Travis] What's surprising?

(Abby gasps)

- [Shepley] That

you go to college.

(Shepley giggles)

- Why can't I go to college?

- I didn't say it,

bro, she said it.

- What?

No, I didn't say that.

- Sorry, have we met?

- Oh, you don't

remember, Travis?

You, you ruined her sweater.

- I ruin a lot of sweaters.

- I'm pretty sure they

retired bad double entendres.

- Pigeon.

- Abby.

My name is Abby.

- Travis.

Travis Maddox.

(lips smack)

- Does that move really work?

- No, not a single time,

but it is sincere.

- You're not my type.

- I'm everybody's type.

(Abby giggles)

See, I got you.

I got a smile out of you.

- No, no, that was not a smile.

That was actually a

condescending chuckle.

- Yeah.

Hey, I'm gonna come

over, all right?

See you later, pigeon.

(chair clanks)

- Abby, my name is Abby.

- [Travis] Well,

it's pigeon now.

- Can you believe that guy?

- And that is what brings us

to the discovery of game theory.

Now, game theory is a term

that was pioneered in the 1950s

by mathematician John Nash.

The term game is defined

as any interaction

where each person's payoff

is affected by the decisions.

- Mm.

(gentle music)

Wow.

So hot.

- That one's my favorite.

It's too late to close it now.

- Has anyone ever told you

that it's not very polite.

- Young lady?

What is your name?

- Abby.

- Ms. Abby, would you

care to educate us

as to why Nash's equilibrium

is irrelevant to game theory?

- Irrelevant?

I can't.

- Well, then perhaps you

should focus a little more on.

- Well, but that's

because it is relevant.

If equilibrium is achieved,

that means that both players

can't increase payoff

by changing decisions

unilaterally.

It can also be

known as no regrets

in the sense that once a

player does make a decision,

they'll have no regrets

thinking about the consequences.

- Have you been reading ahead?

- A bit.

- As I was saying.

- Wow, pigeon, that was so hot.

You got brains.

- Why are you here?

- Why are you sending

me a mixed signal?

- There's nothing

mixed about my signals.

- I just caught you

Insta stalking me.

- I was not Insta stalking.

Look, I'm going to save

you a lot of wasted time.

You can stop the antics, okay?

I'm not sleeping with you.

- I'm not trying to sleep

with you or bag you.

I'm just trying to

take you to dinner.

- Bag me?

What am I, groceries?

Have you not read a newspaper

in the last four years?

Men don't talk

like that anymore.

- Which men?

- The evolved men

of planet Earth.

The ones who are actually in

touch with their feelings.

I don't like you.

(Abby sighs)

Leave me alone.

You're not going to let

this go, aren't you?

- I'll pick you up at eight.

- But wait, you

don't have my number.

- [Professor] Interest

to play his part.

(Abby sighs)

(motor engine revving)

(crickets chirping)

(Travis sighs)

- [Travis] You dress up for me?

- No, I didn't have to

because this is not a date.

- Well, I hope you're hungry.

(helmet thuds)

- No, no, no.

I don't need this because I'm

not getting on that thing.

- Yeah, you are.

- Do you know the statistics

of motorcycles in accidents?

No, I'm not putting

on that thing.

- Yeah, you are.

(helmet thudding)

I can do this all night.

- (sighs) Fine.

(scanner beeps)

- [Travis] Thanks, Miguel.

- Yep.

- You're really not gonna

let me buy you dinner?

- No, this isn't a date.

- Yes, I'm aware.

You've said that twice now.

- [Abby] Oh, you noticed.

- Mm-hm.

That and your outfit,

which screams "I detest Travis."

- I don't detest you.

I just don't like being

a foregone conclusion

for one of the many, many,

many notches on your bedpost.

- Oh, you're smart.

I like that.

- Something you're probably

not used to in a woman.

- Oh, I'm striking out.

I surrender.

We can at least be friends.

- Friends, but with no benefits.

- We're not sleeping together.

I won't even think

about the benefits

unless you want me to.

- No, that can't happen so

that we can stay friends.

- Friends.

Friends.

I've been coming to

this place for years.

My family home is only

three miles that way.

- Aw.

You couldn't move farther

away from your mommy?

- No, that's not it.

- Her grilled cheese

was just that good?

- Well, she's dead.

- (chuckles) Shut up.

Are you serious?

(Travis chuckles)

I'm such an as*h*le,

I'm so sorry.

I feel horrible.

- It's okay, it's okay.

I was only three.

- Okay, I'm not that sorry.

Get your hand off me.

How's your dad?

- He's still alive, so

you can make fun of him.

(Abby chuckles)

He's a good man.

He raised five boys

all on his own.

- Five Maddox brothers?

- Yeah.

Thomas, Taylor, Tyler,

Trent, and Travis.

If you wanna get

good at fighting,

having four older brothers

beat your a*s daily

is a good place to start.

- Why do it?

- College ain't cheap.

Fighting is a good

way to make money.

- Just seems

unnecessarily risky.

- Why?

You worried about me?

- Not even in the slightest.

- What's your story?

- Just your average girl

from your ordinary town.

- Oh, mom and dad?

- One of each.

- Wow, you're a

wealth of information.

- Well, I can't give away

all the goods in one night.

- Most do.

I actually enjoy it.

Are you seriously leaving?

- Dinner's over.

- We just got started.

- Good night, Travis.

(car door thuds)

(gentle instrumental music)

- Hey, purple sweater.

Little help?

- Yeah.

(frisbee thuds)

- [Crowd] Ooh!

- Oh, no! (grunting)

- Oh, my god.

(Parker grunting)

- [Passerby] Police.

- He's, he's fine.

(Parker grunting)

Okay, it's okay.

He's okay.

- I'm fine.

- Okay, are you okay?

- Oh, I'm fine.

- Okay, I'm so sorry.

(Parker grunting)

- Oh, God.

Oh!

- You're so cute

and you're crying,

I swear.

- I'm not, I'm not crying.

It's, uh, it's the wind.

How long have you been captain

of the Frisbee club? (groans)

- Oh, no, no, no,

I'm not captain

of the Frisbee club.

- Oh, it was, uh,

it was a joke.

It was a joke, I'll be okay.

- Oh, hi.

- Hi.

- Hi, I'm Abby.

- I'm gonna go.

I'm, I'm gonna wobble.

- You should put some

ice on your b*lls.

- You should put

some ice on my b*lls.

- Okay. (chuckles)

- [Parker] Oh,

yeah, I'm gonna go.

- It was really nice

to meet you, Parker.

(ball whooshes and thuds)

Oh!

(Parker groans)

- Thanks, man.

- [Man] f*ck you!

- Be careful!

(water splashing)

(gentle instrumental music)

Ow!

Ow.

Could someone turn

the water back on?

(bags thudding)

So the RA said we're

gonna be without water

for the next 24 hours, so

it's just for the night.

Are you sure Shepley

is cool with this?

- Hey, Abby's staying over.

- Just stay out of

Travis's room, all right?

- What?

You didn't tell me

that Travis lives here.

- No, of course I did.

No, remember, I told you.

No, no, no, no,

no, no, no.

- I'm not staying here.

- Abby, Abby!

- No, I'm leaving.

- No, I promise you

will never see him.

He's never even here.

You won't see him, I promise.

You have to stay,

It'll be so fun.

Hey, tell her that

Travis will be okay.

- [Shepley] Oh, he won't

care, he likes you.

- He doesn't know me.

- He likes you.

We're gonna have a sleepover.

So much fun, we'll make s'mores.

Hey, let's go.

- Bye.

- Bye.

(crowd chattering)

- [Mick] Abby, babe, it's Dad.

Where'd you go?

Could you return the call

or at least text me back?

(Carmen moaning)

(Carmen speaking in

foreign language)

(door clicks)

(Carmen speaking in

foreign language)

(Carmen moaning)

(door thuds)

- [Abby] sh*t, sh*t,

sh*t, sh*t, sh*t, sh*t.

(gentle music)

(door creaks and clicks)

(footsteps tapping)

- [Carmen] Excuse me.

(speaks in foreign language)

- [Abby] Sure.

- [Carmen] Okay, merci.

(door thuds)

(gentle music)

(floor creaks)

- [Abby] (screams) Jesus.

- Enjoy the show?

- You scared the crap out of me.

- You know that's not

a very attractive idiom

once you stop and

think about it.

- Because in your

sexist universe,

women don't actually defecate?

- Wow, that's a perfect

word for someone like you.

Did you know that the saying

used to be "bejesus out of me?"

- Your friend gave this

to me to give to you.

(paper crumples and thuds)

What?

The woman that you

just had sex with

gives you her number and

you just throw it away?

- That's not her

leaving her number.

That's her marking

her territory.

- Well, then maybe you

shouldn't have sex with her.

- I don't remember

promising her a thing.

- Wow.

You embody everything that

is wrong with your gender.

She's an adult.

I'm an adult.

It was consensual.

Look at this.

- Consent date.

- [Travis] Can never be

too careful nowadays.

- How many women do you

have contracts with?

- [Travis] No idea, I'm a

quality guy over quantity.

- (groans) I'm gonna throw up.

- Well, my bedroom

is down the hall

and the bed is all yours

for when you wanna crash.

- I'm not gonna

sleep in your bed.

- Why?

No one but me sleeps in my bed.

My bed is sacred ground.

- Well, then why would I

be allowed in your bed?

- Are you planning on

having sex with me tonight?

- No.

- Then it's settled.

(door clicks)

Wow, make yourself at home.

- Sorry, I just have a big

10 a.m. Bio test to cram for,

but I can move back

to the kitchen.

- No, you're fine,

stay where you're at.

Don't be silly. (groans)

- Thank you.

- Do you want me to make

you some tea or something?

- No, but, uh, my

highlighter just died.

Can I borrow one?

- Oh, yeah, check

the top drawer.

Wait, um,

no.

- Wow.

That's a lot.

- Is practicing safe

sex a crime? (chuckles)

- What's this?

- It's not a highlighter,

I'll tell you that.

(device vibrating)

Um.

- It's a yo-yo?

- No, definitely not.

It's awkward.

I'm gonna go shower.

(disinfectant hissing)

(device vibrating)

(Travis whistling)

(crickets chirping)

(gentle music)

(Travis sighs)

(gentle music)

(birds chirping)

(singers vocalizing)

- (giggling) What are you doing?

(cat squeaking)

(Abby laughs)

Bad kitty.

(cat squeaking)

Mouse. (giggles)

Mouse.

(Abby giggling)

- Abby.

Pigeon.

- Really cute.

How much?

- Um.

It's not what do

you think it is.

Abby, you're.

- Wait, what are you doing?

(Abby screaming)

(wings whooshing)

(door clicks)

- [Shepley] Abby!

- [America] Abby!

- [Travis] What the heck?

- [Abby] What is wrong with you?

- I didn't do anything.

You touched me.

- Oh, says the man with

the raging hard-on.

You should be locked up.

- You're the sleepy

c*ck toucher.

I didn't put your hand there.

And if you bothered to

read a biology textbook,

you'd find out

that it's called

parasympathetic nerve response

and you'd know that

if you knew anything

about biology or men.

- Oh, sh*t, Bio!

What time is it?

- 9:42.

- Oh, my God.

- [Both] What are you wearing?

- We were playing.

- We were

playing.

- Let me give you a ride.

- No, this is just a madhouse.

A nurse?

- Yeah, no, I.

- Sorry, excuse me.

(gentle instrumental music)

Sorry.

Oh, my God!

(Abby groans)

(crowd chattering)

(phone beeps)

I slipped.

But I still aced my Bio test.

- (chuckles) Well, I'm glad

you're not drawing attention

to yourself.

- [Abby] Hilarious.

- Okay, I have to run to class,

but I want a full play-by-play

of what happened last night.

- Nothing happened last night.

- Yeah?

- I do not like him.

- Yeah,

and that's why you're giving

him a good morning handy.

(phone beeps)

Is Mick still bothering you?

- [Abby] Yeah.

- You got to cut him

out of your life.

- He is out of my life.

- He is not out of your life

because he is still texting you.

I-I gotta go to class.

- What?

- Hey.

Parker, we meet again.

- Abby, are you okay?

- Yeah, yeah, it's a

long story. (chuckles)

Hey, um, how are

your, your b*lls?

- Not good.

- Oh, my God.

- That's okay.

I think they said I had a 20%

chance of a normal sex life.

- Are you messing with me?

- Not funny?

- No, it was, it was hilarious.

Well, um, okay, bye.

- Do you have dinner

plans tonight?

- Me?

- Yes.

- No, I-I-I-I do not

have dinner plans.

- I know a great Italian spot.

- Um, um.

- Is that a, is that?

- (gasps) No, that is a yes.

Yes, I would love

that very much.

Pick me up at seven, I

live at Tucker dormitory.

- Sure, I'll pick you up then.

- Okay.

Bye.

(gentle music)

I see you!

(laughs) Oh, Parker.

Really?

Thank you.

Thank you, Parker.

(phone beeps)

Oh, no way, Travis Maddox.

You can keep knocking but I

am not gonna answer that door.

No way. (laughs)

I'll see you soon, Parker.

- Thanks again, Sonny.

- Anytime, doctor.

- Doctor Hayes.

- He's jumping

the g*n, you know.

I just started, that's all.

- Wow, fancy-fancy.

- Yeah.

Wow.

- Are you on call?

- No, I-I just got a heads-up

about a show tonight.

- Oh, oh, I can get

my own ride home.

- No, no, no, we-we

should both go.

Unless you've got work

or sick of seeing me.

- No.

No, I would love to go.

- This is-this is gonna be fun.

(Abby chuckles)

- You know, I've always wanted

to see Titus Andronicus.

It's considered to be

Shakespeare's most violent play.

- You don't mind v*olence?

- No, I was something

of a tomboy growing up.

- Well, then you're

in for a treat.

- Ooh, I guess it's starting.

- (speaks indistinctly)

he's a state champ.

He's gonna come out swinging.

He's not gonna be

wasting any sort of time.

Okay, what are you doing?

- Abby hasn't texted

me back today.

- Oh, my God.

Would you forget about Abby?

Have you, have

you seen this guy?

He's got a white robe and

a belt that's huge, okay?

I mean, you're acting like

the kissing booth over here.

You need to focus.

(hand slaps)

- I am focused.

(hands slapping)

- (scoffs) That's

the Travis we need.

Come on.

- I just don't know why

she hasn't texted me back.

I'm gonna go outside and see

if I can get better

cell reception.

(upbeat music)

- We're dead.

(crowd cheering and clapping)

- Oh, wow, modern

interpretation.

I love Shakespeare.

(foot thuds)

(crowd cheering and clapping)

- All right, all right.

Next up, we have the main event:

Freddy Heflin versus

Travis "Mad Dog" Maddox!

- This is gonna be great.

Travis is a real animal.

Are you okay?

- Yeah, yeah, it's just

a little hot in here.

I'm gonna go find a bathroom.

(door clicks)

- What the f*ck, Abby?

You don't respond

to any of my texts,

and now you're here

dressed like that

with your t*tties hanging out.

- They are not hanging out.

This is a tasteful

amount of cleavage.

- Yeah?

Well, they're distracting me.

- Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot.

It's all about

you, you egomaniac.

- I must break you.

- Go for it.

- That's who you're fighting?

- Yes.

- That guy could k*ll you.

- Is this your weird little

way of admitting you like me?

- I don't like you.

But I do worry about you.

I worry about the planet.

They're two very

different things.

- Okay, well, if it

puts your mind at ease,

he's not even gonna hit me.

- Hilarious.

- Are you doubting me?

- Yeah.

- Care to make it interesting?

- Make it interesting?

Like a bet?

- [Travis] Yeah.

- I don't bet.

(door clicks)

- Come on, Travis,

they need you.

- Yeah, just a minute.

How's this?

If he manages to

lay a hand on me,

I'll go without sex for a week.

- Ooh.

- A month.

Three months.

- Three months?

That's impossible

for someone like you.

- Okay, and if I win, you have

to stay with me for a month.

- You're on.

But get it through your head,

I am never having sex with you.

- I don't wanna have

sex with you, pidge.

I wanna be around you.

You're good for me.

(crowd cheering)

You are handsome.

- You're dead.

(Freddy grunts)

(crowd cheering)

- Hah.

You are handsome as hell.

No wonder you're the champ.

Champ of my heart.

(punches whooshing)

- Come on, hit him!

- You ever hiked

Brokeback Mountain?

Do you wanna?

- I'll be gentle, you know.

(punches whooshing)

Giddy up.

- [Woman]

(crowd cheering)

(Freddy growling)

- What are you doing?

- Shut up.

(Freddy grunting)

(fists whooshing)

- Hit him!

(Freddy grunting)

(fists whooshing)

(cage clanks)

Just once!

(Freddy grunting)

Get back in your

crib, little baby.

(Freddy growls)

(Freddy grunting)

(fists whooshing)

(cage clanks)

Oh-ho-ho.

Now, (indistinctly).

So I'm saving the upper

left sock throw for you.

- Just once, hit him!

(Freddy grunts)

(fists thuds)

- Here we go!

(kick thuds)

(fists thudding)

(gentle music)

(crowd cheering)

- Ladies and gentlemen,

Travis Maddox!

(Travis grunting)

- Pack your bags, pigeon.

You're coming home with me.

(Travis imitating

monkey whooping)

- How did this happen?

(Travis imitating

monkey whooping)

- Hey, I got you a water.

(Travis grunting)

What's going on?

(gentle music)

(sighs) I just need

to process this.

- I know.

- We go out for a great dinner.

Get on really well.

I take you to a show.

I leave you for five minutes.

And during that time,

you've decided to move

in with Travis Maddox.

- I lost a bet.

- Right.

- We're just friends.

I mean, we're not even friends.

We're nothing.

I had a really nice

time with you tonight

and I would love to do it again.

(Parker chuckles)

Do you think I can, I can

get a good-night kiss?

(Travis screams)

(Abby screams)

- Oh, God!

No!

- Travis!

- Time to go.

- Yeah, you need to, you

need to leave the car.

- He is not going

to do anything.

See?

- No, he's gonna hurt me.

- He's not gonna hurt you.

- No, he's gonna hurt me.

- Open the door.

- Get out of the car.

- [Abby] No.

(knuckles rapping)

- Please get out the car!

- You are strong, it's okay.

- No, he is a maniac.

He is gonna hurt me,

leave the car!

- He's not going to hurt.

- Leave the car now!

- Oh, my God.

- Get out the f*cking car!

- Open the door!

- You're being insane.

Okay, okay.

- Leave the car.

Go, go, leave the car!

- Okay, I'm leaving.

Okay, okay.

- Go, please.

Go now.

- [Travis] Okay.

- Okay.

Okay.

(Travis screams)

- Oh, Jesus.

Yeah, on it, yeah.

(Travis giggling)

(Travis imitating

monkey whooping)

- [Abby] I cannot believe

this is happening.

- Well, for the record,

I didn't think you'd

really settle up.

- Well, I made a bet, I lost.

You're only as

good as your word.

I made it through one night

without any funny business.

I think I can make

it through 30 more.

(Travis laughs)

What?

- Well, you did give me a.

- I did not give you a handy.

I have no interest in

touching your d*ck ever again.

- Oh, oh.

- Okay, got it?

- Okay, okay.

You're getting a little aggro.

- Oh, what?

Do women with emotions

make you scared?

- Uh-uh.

- You wait till I'm

on my period, okay?

I might s*ab you.

- Sorry, I thought this

would be a fun idea.

- [Abby] Well, it wasn't.

- How about we just go to sleep?

- Yeah, you think?

Give me this, I want that.

And don't touch me!

Don't cross this line, okay?

Wall of China.

(gentle music)

I never thought I'd

miss you half this much

- I just cleaned in here.

You live like animals.

You guys are filthy.

- [Shepley] Abby, come on.

- [Both] Get out of the way.

- [Shepley] Come on,

get out of the way.

- Abby, get out of the way!

(hand slaps)

- Hey!

(hand slapping)

- No, no, no, no!

About you

- [Woman] Come on, girls.

(ladies chuckling)

As soon as I wake up

Any night

- Do you mind?

Any day

(punches thudding)

I know that it's you I

need to take the blues away

(punches thudding)

It must be love

Love, love

It must be love

- Shut up.

Love, love

- Oh.

Nothing more

Nothing less

Love is the best

(Abby clears throat)

How can it be that

we can say so much

- Hey, Shep, I'm

gonna hit the store.

Do you want?

- Bring it up, yeah.

(Shepley exhaling)

Yeah.

Bless you and bless me, baby

- I'm trying, I'm trying!

- Up, up, up, up.

Okay, good job, go home.

Are you gonna quit?

Go on then!

- No, I'm trying!

I'm trying!

(grunts) Yup.

- [Travis] One.

- Two.

You know, this is really easy.

You made this so hard.

Oh.

No, I can do it.

I don't know.

Taking me home to

meet the family.

- [Travis] Get over yourself.

It's just Sunday dinner.

- [Tyler] What have you been

doing for the past hour?

- [Taylor] Trying

to find the f*cking.

Where is it?

How is that possible?

(motor revving)

- That's how it was

when I found it.

- Oh, you're f*cking worthless.

Just hand me a seven-16th.

- Hey, I'm not your b*tch.

- And you're a

pretty little b*tch.

- [Tyler] Call me

a b*tch again, huh?

- b*tch, b*tch.

- Hey, dipshits.

(hand claps)

We got company.

- Oh, oh, oh, oh, my.

Baby bro is bringing

home a girl.

- Guys, this is Abby.

Abby, these are the moron

twins, Tyler and Taylor.

- Hi.

- Fraternal, obviously.

- And we're not morons.

Travis is the moron.

- Can you guys not act

like assholes just yet?

- [Both] Oh.

- Brother's mouthing off

in front of his woman.

You're a big guy, aren't you?

- Yeah, you're the big

man on campus, right?

- Doesn't make any sense.

- Well, this makes sense.

(Travis groans)

- Oh.

- Taylor!

- [Taylor] Cobra kai!

- [Travis] Get back, Taylor.

- So immature.

Oh, you're Abigail, right?

- Mm-hm.

- I'm, uh, Trenton.

The most attractive

Maddox brother.

- [Abby] Hey.

- Has anyone ever told

you you have the most.

- No!

No.

- Ladies, not in

front of my bike.

Take it in the ring.

- [Boys] Yes, sir.

- Put my tools back

where you found them.

- [Boys] Yes, sir.

- Hey, I'm Jeff.

- I'm Abby.

- Nice to meet you.

- [Abby] You too.

- Come on inside.

- [Abby] Thanks.

(boys grunting)

- So, uh, Abby,

have you ever experienced

the deliciousness

of fried chicken from Kentucky?

- [Tyler] Moron, not every

chicken is from Kentucky.

- Yeah, it is.

That's why they call it

Kentucky Fried Chicken.

- What's going on here?

Are you serious?

You're back.

- What's up, boys?

- [Trenton] Yo.

- Hey.

- Dude, hey, you made it.

- What's going on?

- Hey, sorry, uh, work ran late.

All right, you must

be, um, is it Abby?

- Yeah, and you're

Thomas, right?

You're the oldest.

- I see Travis warned

you about us, huh?

- [Taylor] Riveting

conversation, let's dig in.

- Yeah.

- Oh, yeah.

- Grace.

Travis.

- (sighs) Oh, Heavenly Father.

Thank you for the food,

for we remember the hungry.

Please look after our

dear mother, Diane.

May she rest in peace.

- [All] Amen.

- Give me.

- Can we?

- Okay.

- Is this all drumsticks, Dad?

- I want breasts,

I want breasts.

- I want breasts.

- Guys, guys, there's

a lady present.

- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

- Oh, wow.

- They're being nice today.

Those are some good pieces.

- Really sweet, thank you, guys.

- Uh, I don't wanna

rain on Travis's parade,

but my shift starts at 10, so

let's get down to business.

- [Taylor] 10, God.

- That's like.

- I'm just saying if you

wanna play, let's play.

- I'm gonna have to

whoop your butt fast.

- Oh, yeah.

I-I can carry some stuff.

(brother humming)

- All right, the name of the

game is Texas hold 'em, Abby,

you in?

- Oh, that's not for me.

Drinks?

- [Boys] Yeah.

- Beer for me and

there's chips up there

and there's dip and

there's like you know,

just whatever you can carry.

- [Abby] Okay.

- Deal, deal, deal,

deal, deal, deal.

- Let's go.

- [Thomas] Let me get the chip.

- [Trenton] Got nothing.

- Eat sh*t.

Straight on the river and

he does it again, boys.

(boys chattering)

- Are you kidding me?

- Abby, you've been

watching a while.

You wanna join?

- Oh, I'm okay.

- Don't worry.

We take it easy on

the ladies over here.

(Abby chuckles)

- We can play Go

Fish if you like.

- You know, I

actually don't think

it's a question of you

guys going easy on me.

I actually think

it's a question of me

going easy on you guys.

- [Boys] Oh.

- Okay, you're being serious.

- [Abby] Mm-hm.

- [Jeff] Okay.

- Okay.

- Abby, you might

not wanna do that.

Taylor may look like an idiot,

but he happens to be one of

the best poker players in town.

- Oh, in town.

- In the county.

- Oh, wow, the county.

- [Tyler] He's

even played on  TV.

- Oh, on TV.

That's pretty

impressive, I don't know.

(cards flipping)

Let's go.

- Okay.

(intense music)

Fold, beginner's luck.

- This is no beginner's luck.

- Well, I never said

I was a beginner.

Call.

- Flash.

- Pair of aces.

- [Twins] Yes!

- Yes!

- [Twins] Da, da,

da, da, da, da, da.

- Aces and eights, boys.

- Don't tell me!

That's a full house.

- Yes, it is.

- You just got

hustled, bro. (laughs)

- Well, no, it's only

hustling if I keep your money.

- Oh.

- Oh, no, no, no.

Sweetheart, that money's yours.

You won it fair and square.

- sh*t.

- Where did you learn to play?

- [Abby] Home.

- Home?

Where was that?

- Vegas.

My dad taught me.

- Used to be a high-stakes

poker player named Abernathy.

I remember hearing stories

about him in Vegas.

- What happened?

- Uh, he had this daughter.

Went with him everywhere.

I think the mom

walked out on him

so he was raising

her on his own.

- [Mick] Your eyes even

when you're shuffling.

- [Jeff] While she was way

too young to play legally

but man, she was

a poker prodigy.

As she got better, he got worse.

So she was left bailing

him out even as a kid.

- [Mick] Look your

opponent in the eyes.

- I remember this.

They called her Lucky Charms.

- Lucky 13.

Abby, you must have

heard of her, right?

She must be about your age.

After all, this is you

in the article, isn't it?

(intense music)

- You're Lucky 13?

- [Tyler] We just got

hustled by Lucky 13?

- No f*cking way.

- Guys, I'm sorry.

I wasn't trying to hustle you

guys or anything, I swear.

I'm.

- Lucky 13's in this house?

- Yeah.

- [Twins] Lucky 13 in the house!

- Lucky 13 in the house.

- Abby, can I get

a photo with you?

- No, guys, it wasn't really.

- Guys, guys, hey.

You're acting like

a bunch of fangirls.

- [Tyler] Get out of my way.

- You're a fangirl.

- She beat me.

You're a fangirl, move!

(Jeff laughs)

Shut up!

Get your ugly a*s

face out of the way!

(gentle music)

I've gotta be near

you every night

(Abby chuckles)

Everyday

- You act like you're

so f*cking innocent.

I couldn't be happy baby

- f*ck you!

Any other way

- How could he do that to Tessa?

- Jab.

Cross.

Why are you so happy?

- I don't know, I'm a

happy fighter, okay?

- No, no.

If you were actually

happy in the ring,

it would be so easy to just slap

that smirk off.

- It would disarm people.

- Jab, cross.

This time with

actual meaning to it.

- Okay, okay, I get

it, I'll be angry.

- Well, can you go?

Go now, go now!

- I'm angry, okay.

- Jab, cross, jab, cross.

(punch thuds)

- Oh.

It must be love

Love, love

Nothing more

Nothing less

Love is the best

- Just like I've, I've

never dated anyone like him

but when I'm with him, I just,

sometimes feel like he

could be my forever person.

I don't know, he just

like makes me laugh

in this way that

like, I don't know,

like Travis makes you laugh.

- I don't know what

you're talking about.

- That is bullshit.

- I don't know.

- b*tch, you know.

- Okay, yeah,

look, I will admit.

His physique is appealing.

- (chuckles) His

physique is appealing?

- Yes, his physique

is appealing.

But I've learned not

to court excitement

for the sake of excitement.

I mean, truthfully, he

seems a little crazy.

And we both know that the last

thing I need is more crazy.

- Absolutely.

(keyboard clacking)

(gentle music)

(messages whooshing)

(keyboard clacking)

(knuckles rapping)

- I.

Ugh.

(door creaks)

- I believe that's

my side of the bed.

- I'm moving.

(both groans)

- Did you finish the homework?

- Yeah, just about.

You need any help?

- [Travis] Nah, I'm good.

- Please tell me you're not

gonna clip your toenails in bed.

(clipper thuds)

You're gonna miss me

- So, I hear it's someone's

birthday in two days.

- You hear, or you eavesdropped?

That was between Mer and I.

(finger snaps)

- Ow!

- [Abby] That was a

private conversation.

- That hurt.

- Well, it serves you right

for eavesdrop (snorts).

- Whoa-ho.

What did I just get

out of you there?

What are you, half bulldog?

- Well, you groped me.

- I did not grope

you, that was a poach.

(Abby snorts)

Oh, you are a snort.

I didn't realize this.

- Mm, I'm not ticklish.

- Okay, don't.

Do you really wanna play this?

Okay.

- Come on.

- There we go.

- This is just.

- How do you think

this was gonna end?

- Get off me.

I'll fight you, you know,

I'll fight you.

- Fight?

Oh, you.

Ow!

You bit my cat.

- Oh, relax.

It was a nibble.

- Yeah, well it hurt.

- Oh, did it?

You loved it.

(both panting)

- I did kind of love it, yeah.

(both moaning)

(Abby moaning)

- Wait!

(Travis grunts)

(Abby panting)

You good?

- (sighs) Am I good?

- Mm-hm.

- (sighs) No.

Um, I'm just confused.

- Where are you going?

- This is a joke.

- Oh, come on, Travis.

Don't you wanna talk about this?

- Talk about it, why?

You want to hear how I

really feel about you, Abby?

- [Abby] No, I-I don't.

- Abby, then.

- Because I don't

feel the same way.

- You're lying.

- I'm not.

Travis, you're vulgar, you're

a brute, you're (sighs).

Can you say my name,

say my name, say my name

(Abby moaning)

- Touch me.

(Abby moaning)

(both moaning)

I have to pee.

I'm sorry.

(door thuds)

(knuckles rapping)

(Shepley moaning)

- [Shepley] Wait,

where you going?

I'm on the verge.

- I'll be right back.

- [Shepley] Babe, I'm on.

(door clicks)

- What's going on?

- Shh.

- You okay?

- No, no, I'm not okay.

Um, Travis and I, we made

out kind of aggressively.

- Clarify.

- And then I grabbed,

he grabbed my.

I put his hand on my.

- Breast?

- No, lower.

- Oh.

- America, I don't

know what to do.

It's like, the logic

goes out of my head.

If I go back in there,

I'm not gonna be

able to stop myself.

- (chuckles) So you do like him.

- America, I think

I'm in love with him.

- Hey, Abby.

This is a totally

normal position

and I'm not flexing at all.

Hey, baby girl.

Are you okay?

Are you okay?

Are you okay?

She's okay, she's

okay, she's okay.

She's just nervous,

but I can help you

through your nervousness.

Don't read her like this.

It's too corny.

You're not toxic,

you're a cool guy.

You're really cool and strong.

Hi, Abby.

Give me a hug.

Oh, no, that's so scary.

(intense music)

(footsteps tapping)

(door creaks)

(door thuds)

(door clicks)

- [Abby] Travis?

(phone message beeps)

(vehicle engines revving)

(crowd chattering)

- Yeah, no, I mean, he might

have a (speaks indistinctly).

(door thuds)

Guys.

Oh, hold up.

Where the hell have you been?

- Out.

- Jesus, you reek of alcohol.

(cat meows)

- (sighs) I got a cat.

I named him Tabby, he's a stray.

(cat hisses)

And I would k*ll for him,

and he would k*ll for me

unlike some people I

know in this house.

- That's the neighbor's

cat, Rumpleteazer.

- [Travis] All right,

isn't this Tabby?

- I mean, brah, it's got

a collar right there.

(cat meowing)

- sh*t.

Well.

- Hey, bud.

- The hell are you

still doing here?

- I was up all night

worried about you.

- (laughs) That's rich.

Shouldn't you be worried about

your boyfriend or something?

- My boyfriend?

- Yeah, Mick.

That's right, I saw the

text on your computer.

Very nice, very nice.

Staying here while

he's texting you

"I love you, I miss you."

(scoffs) What a joke.

- Travis, Mick is my dad.

And how often are you going

through my text messages?

- "Can I come see

you?" would make sense.

So it was your dad?

(Travis laughs)

No way.

That's terrible of me.

Well, I misinterpreted that.

That's great news.

- Is it great news?

Travis, you invaded my privacy

and then you turned

around and ghosted me.

Goodbye.

- Abby, wait, wait.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

I-I was jealous, I messed up.

- No, Travis, you

didn't mess up.

If anything, you just showed

me who you really are.

(gentle music)

- Abby, wait, can we talk?

- [Abby] Bye.

(door creaks)

- [Travis] Hey.

(door thuds)

(soft music)

(Abby sniffs and mumbling)

(crowd chattering)

- [Parker] Did

anyone ever tell you

that you're a very cute sleeper?

- Hi, Parker.

- Hi.

Is Travis nearby?

Do I need to be worried?

- Ugh, no.

- It's been a while.

How-how have you been?

- Pretty shitty.

- Postmates?

- I would love that.

- So, I spent most

of fifth grade

with a broken leg that

they had to reset twice.

So I got to know the

doctors pretty well,

and realized that's

what I wanted to do

with the rest of my life.

- What kind of doctor

do you wanna be?

- Pediatric medicine.

- Right, yeah, of

course, because it's you.

- Anyway, that's

enough about me.

- What do you wanna

be when you grow up?

- I'm still trying

to figure it out.

(phone message beeps)

(phone keys clacking)

(phone message beeps)

Really good ramen.

- Do you wanna get out of here?

- Yes, yes, yes.

I'm saying yes a lot, but yes.

- It is right up here.

- [Abby] We're not gonna

a show again, are we?

- I would not make

that mistake again.

(Abby chuckles)

(door creaks)

Right through here.

- [Abby] Why is it

so dark in here?

- [All] Surprise!

- Whoo.

All right, everybody.

Get some drinks.

Get some shots.

Happy birthday, Abby.

- Thank you.

- [Shepley] Hey,

are you surprised?

- Yeah.

- Touchdown.

And, uh, nice work, doc.

- Were you in on this?

- Uh, only for the

last 10 minutes.

Shepley put out an APB for you.

- Babe, success, success.

Take some shots.

Told you this would work out,

did I not, I said it.

- You did, you really did.

Yeah.

- I'm gonna grab us a

drink and I will take this.

- Oh, thank you.

- How are you, birthday pal?

- Hi.

Thank you.

- Isn't this great?

- Yeah, yeah.

Who are all these people?

- Mm, no idea.

Travis got it in his head

that this was the only

way to say he was sorry

and then Shepley got

like really excited and,

and I couldn't talk

them off the ledge.

- There he is.

I should probably

go talk to Travis.

- Yeah.

Bye, little bird.

(keg tapping)

- You busy?

- Hey, it's the

almost birthday girl.

Surprised?

- Yeah, surprised is

an understatement.

You even recruited Parker.

- Well, he found you.

I should have known that you

guys would be hanging out.

- Well, I can trust him.

- Cool.

- Cool.

Um, well, I'm gonna.

- Yeah, have fun.

- Yeah.

- You okay?

- No.

I need to get f*cked up.

- I can make that happen.

- [Crowd] Shot, shot,

shot, shot, shot.

- Whoo!

- Ooh!

- Oh, two.

- Oh.

- sh**t, oh, all right.

- Damn, girl.

- Whoo!

- It's that kind of night.

Oh.

- Oh.

- Slow down.

- I'm so sorry.

The line was interminable.

- Oh.

- I got, I got us merlots.

- Parker, concentrating.

- Uh.

- Why are you so good at this?

- I'll be over

there on the sofa.

- You played this before.

You played this.

(electro-pop music)

- If you look at the health

care system under Obamacare,

we are obviously on

a collision course.

I know, it's bad.

(electro-pop music continues)

Oh, come on.

- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Abby, Abby, Abby.

- You're good.

He's got.

(electro-pop music continues)

- No, I don't want kids!

- What do you, what do you

mean you don't want kids?

It's.

- I don't want kids.

I don't wanna.

- Why?

I never knew this.

- I don't want any kids.

- I want like five kids.

- Five kids?

- Yes.

I want Ted Junior.

- Don't, who is Ted One?

- Millicent.

- I'm not a baby factory.

- This is,

this is like whole.

- And I'm not naming

my kid Millicent.

- This is the point of life.

- (screams) I hate Millicent.

- [Shepley] Well, I hate you.

- [America] I hate you more.

(Shepley sobbing)

- Are you okay?

- No.

No, it's over.

I'm never giving my heart

to anyone ever again.

- No!

No, don't say that.

You just need to dance.

You just need to dance

your troubles away.

Just do what I do.

Oh, hi.

- Babe, I am so sorry.

I don't know why I

said that out there.

- I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

Do you wanna go

and make outside?

- Yes, right now?

Yeah, let's go.

- Okay.

- [Abby] Have fun.

- This has been great,

I'm gonna get out of here.

- No, come on, dance with me.

- I'm-I'm not in the mood.

- Oh, come on, loosen up.

Oh, I know.

I'm twerking.

- [Parker] Uh.

- The boys like the twerking.

- No, no, you're not.

No, this is, uh, yeah.

- This is twerking.

Twerking.

- Yeah, yeah, it's good.

- Come on, have

fun, you're not fun.

Come on, loosen up, have fun.

Come on.

- He's in the back room.

- Excuse me.

- Travis?

The guy you're looking for.

- No, I came here with you.

- Wow!

Oh, you actually recoiled.

- You just caught me off guard.

- Be honest with yourself

and see this thing

through with Travis.

- He's not good for me.

- You keep telling

yourself that.

- Hello, hello.

Okay, thank you.

- Hey, what the

f*ck are you doing?

You heard of alcohol poisoning?

You hit double

digits an hour ago.

- What are you, counting?

- Yeah, actually.

You've had enough for tonight.

- No.

- Have you got

anything to eat today?

- Yes, soup.

- Soup?

- Soup.

- Okay, well, that's

gonna end badly for you.

Stop drinking.

- No.

- [Travis] You're

beyond stubborn.

- Oh, I'm so sorry

I'm not one of your

subservient little wenches.

- Do you know how hard

this was to put together?

I did all this for you.

- I didn't ask you

to do any of this.

- I-I know, that's the point.

I did it because

I care about you.

- Well, Travis, you're too late.

Tomorrow the bet's over, and

you never have to see me again.

- [Travis] sh*t.

Abby, wait.

- [Abby] Go away!

- Stand still.

I, you're a mess.

Why are you running?

- You're a mess.

- I'm faster than you.

- No, no, no.

- Abby!

- Get off, no!

- Okay, okay, okay.

- You know, you

are such a coward.

You're such a coward.

- You're not making any sense.

- No, you're not.

You just run away from me.

Rather than ask me who Mick was.

You just-you just run away

and then you just throw me

this really big surprise

birthday party for my birthday.

And you think it's

all gonna be okay

where I don't even know anybody.

And then you just

ignore me all night.

And you think I'm just

gonna forgive you?

Because you throw me this really

big surprise birthday party

for my birthday where

I don't know anybody.

- You said that already.

- Stop telling me what to do!

- Okay, okay.

First off, I did

apologize to you

and I tried to have a

conversation with you too.

But you ran off to

the f*cking library

only to show up

later with Parker

and then proceed to

get beyond f*cked up.

So, pidge, you're gonna

have to walk away from me

because I can't

walk away from you.

(vomits splashes)

(gentle music)

Beautiful.

- When did I have noodles?

(Abby coughing)

I think I'm done.

(both groaning)

- Okay.

- Oh, sorry.

- Oh, you're all right.

Well, I sure hope you're done.

I'm not sure if you

have anything left

in there to throw up.

(both laughs)

- Hey, you wanna make out?

- Not really, no.

I don't.

(Abby laughs)

You know what the best

part about this is, pigeon?

- Hm.

- You're not gonna

remember any of this.

- I'm not?

- No.

So when I tell you that

I'm madly in love with you.

- I won't remember.

- But I really mean it.

- Hm.

(Abby gasps)

Do you wanna go to

International House of Pancakes

and get pancakes?

(Travis gasps)

Yeah?

You wanna go?

I love pancakes.

- Oh, man, what a great idea.

I'm gonna get you up.

- Do you wanna go?

- I'm gonna stand you up.

- Oh, I wanna go to pancakes.

Okay, I want pancakes.

- I got you a clean

shirt instead,

I'll be back.

- Thank you, that's very nice.

- Um.

- I'm a monster. (chuckles)

- Okay, let me help you.

- I'm stuck out here.

- Yeah.

- Thank you.

- Okay, there we

go, put this on.

- Turn around.

I'm decent.

Just kidding.

(Abby laughs)

- Oh, my God.

- I got you.

- Put your shirt on.

- I got you.

- Put it on.

- I'm putting it on.

- Okay.

- Okay, it's on. (laughs)

- Oh, my God.

Oh, I can't trust.

- I got you again.

- You did, you got me,

and I really wanna look again,

but you should

put your shirt on.

- I'm a little

prankster tonight.

- You are very

silly, I'll say that.

Okay, you did it,

I'm so proud of you.

I'm gonna get you

some water, okay?

I'll be back.

- That's so nice.

Thank you,

you're really nice.

- I'm very sweet.

- Thanks.

- Who's your daddy?

(door thuds)

(crowd screaming)

(phone ringing)

- Hey, baby.

- Hi, Mick.

- How are you?

- It's my birthday.

I was just wondering

if you were gonna call.

- I know it's your birthday.

I, uh, I wanted to come see you

but I have no idea

where you are.

- [Abby] I'm in

college in Sacramento.

- [Mick] How's college?

How are you doing?

- I'm good.

I'm good.

- I haven't talked to you

and I-I-I really

miss talking to you.

- [Travis] Pidge?

- Oh, I have to go.

I love you, Dad, bye.

(car engine revving)

What time is it?

- One.

- In the afternoon?

How am I not hung over?

- Well, I forced

a liter of water

down your throat along

with two ibuprofens

before you went to sleep.

(Abby chuckles)

What?

- It's just that one

night, you're drunk.

Then the next night, I'm drunk.

- Yeah, we're not

really in sync, are we?

- We're like a disaster.

- You know,

just thinking we can

kick this birthday off

with some breakfast in bed.

- I would love a coffee.

- Coming right up.

- Thank you.

(sniffs) Oh.

(Abby sighs)

(footsteps tapping)

(door creaks)

- [Travis] Here you go.

- Thank you.

You know I was thinking

since it's my birthday

and our last night

together as roommates

that maybe we do

something special.

- What do you have in mind?

- Let's look in

the magic drawer.

A foot massage.

- Anything you want.

(gentle music)

(Abby groans)

Too much?

- No, it's good, it's good.

It's really good.

Do it again.

(Abby groaning)

Okay, okay.

Maybe lighter.

Maybe lighter,

lighter, lighter.

- Okay, okay, okay.

(Abby sighs)

- Yeah. (chuckles)

That's good.

My calf's kind of hurting.

- And you want me to?

- Yes, please.

(Abby moans)

Yeah, that feels good.

- Is there anyone else do

you want me to massage?

- Here.

(Abby moans)

And,

maybe here.

I can show you why

(upbeat music)

Motorcycle

But I know the way inside

Secret in your eyes

Let me take time

(Abby moaning)

- Come here.

Take this off.

Come here.

Come here.

(both panting)

(condom wrapper rips)

- Works for me.

- Mm-hm.

Now take these off.

- Yeah, I'll try.

Okay.

(both panting)

Yeah, look at me.

- [Both] One.

- Two. (sighs)

(both panting)

I got impatient.

- Are you okay?

- Uh-huh.

Is it in?

- Is it in?

(Abby laughs)

(Travis sighs)

- I got you.

- Yeah, you did.

(Abby chuckles)

- Shut up and just kiss me.

(Abby moaning)

(both panting)

(upbeat music continues)

(lips smack)

- Well, you've

exhausted me officially.

(Abby giggling)

I think I'm gonna go to sleep.

Good night, Abby.

- Good night, Travis.

(bell ringing)

(car engine revving)

(birds chirping)

(intense music)

- Abby?

Abby Abernathy.

Good morning.

- Good morning.

Can I help you?

- Uh, this might sound weird,

but I'm gonna need

you to come with me.

- Yeah, no, that's

not going to happen.

- What if I asked nicely?

- Have a nice day.

- [Vince] It's about your dad.

- My dad?

- [Vince] Yeah.

- What about him?

- [Vince] He's placing

bad bets and owes my boss.

They're gonna break his legs

if you don't come with me.

(intense music)

(intense music continues)

(phone beeps)

(phone beeps)

- What?

- Hey.

- There you guys are,

where have you been?

- What's going on, man?

Just geez.

- Abby's disappeared.

Now help me look for

a clue or anything.

- First of all,

don't yell at me.

Second of all, there's a lot

about Abby that you don't know.

- I know everything.

I know that she's Lucky 13,

and now I know that she packed

her mattress full of money.

- Hang on, I'm

tracking her location.

She's headed to Vegas.

- Vegas?

- This isn't good.

Wait, hey, that's my phone!

- Buy yourself a new one.

- d*ck.

- What?

Feeling like I'm only

Feeling like I'm chick

Like a chick

Livin' like I'm crazy

Does anybody hear

- Hey.

- Hey.

Hey, Mick.

- (clears throat) I'm sorry.

- How much do you owe Benny?

- [Mick] A hundred grand.

- $100,000, Dad?

- I know, I know.

- Are you kidding me, Dad?

- I'm doing all

this stuff, I swear.

I'm-I'm doing Gamblers

Anonymous and Debtors Anonymous.

I've-I've complete.

- It works if you work it.

Isn't that what they say, Mick?

Hello, Abby.

How's your game?

- I'm retired.

- Oh, Abigail, anonymous

college student.

Well, uh, for your

father's sake,

I hope it's a short time

because he owes me 100 grand

by midnight tonight.

- Come on.

Your own dad wouldn't

even lend him any money.

You know he has a problem.

- Unlike my father,

may he rest in peace,

I'm not running a daycare,

I'm running a business.

- Well, 100 grand by

tonight is impossible.

- We both know,

with your talent,

you can make that in a day.

I used to watch you win 30

grand in 30 minutes underground.

Who do you think

you're talking to?

- I'm underage.

- If I get caught, I have

to drop out of college.

- You've lived here

long enough, kiddo.

You know how to

avoid getting caught.

- There has to be another

way that we can handle this.

- There it is, but

you're not gonna like it.

(fingers snaps)

- [Abby] Hey, hey!

- No, no, no, no, please no!

- I'll do it, I'll do it!

- Good to see you

again, Abigail.

Mick.

Hey, enough with the buffet.

Get her a room.

Leave her the f*ck alone.

Let's go.

Come on, take the top off.

What are you doing here?

(motorcycle engine revving)

(taser crackling)

(upbeat music)

(elevator pings)

- Wow, wow, wow.

- Did you do what I asked?

- Yeah, just like

you instructed.

Are you sure you

wanna stay here?

There are bigger

whales at the Bellagio.

- They'll recognize me there.

I'm trying to stay

under the radar.

- Anything else, Your Majesty?

- Yeah, give the waitress 200

to start watering down my drinks

and go wait outside

until I call you.

- You got it.

(motorcycle engine revving)

- Hey.

Are you guys playing poker?

- No, it's roulette.

(Abby groaning)

- There's a minimum

buy-in of five grand.

- Ooh, okay, Lion King.

- Look at you, you look nice.

But this is a high-stakes room.

Do yourself a favor and

go to the main floor

and pick out a

shiny slot machine.

- I can't go back

to the main floor.

You see, I'm at this

bachelorette party

and Cheryl invited

this twat, Terry,

who hates me because Lyle

finger-banged me on Halloween,

which in my defense I thought

that they were separated.

Where's my vibrator?

- [Players] Huh?

(upbeat music)

- Psst, is this a good hand?

What's up with the

silent treatment?

(chips clattering)

Hey, Cliff, I like

your tiger shirt.

Or is it cheetah?

- Can you be quiet?

- Can I be quiet?

Can you be quiet?

I'm as quiet as a mouse.

as*h*le, say what?

- What?

- Exactly.

(upbeat music)

I've got two black cards.

Is that good?

- You gotta show your hand.

- The cards!

- You gotta be kidding me.

- Hey, Cliff.

Rawr.

(upbeat music)

Okay, well, I'm gonna go

meet up with my peeps.

It's been real, fellas.

And like my dad used to say,

if you can't spot the chump

in the first 30 seconds,

then you're the chump.

Bye.

(phone beeps)

(crowd chattering)

- Ma'am?

You in the blue dress?

Stop.

I gotcha.

- Jesse.

- I totally got you.

- Hi.

- [Jesse] Come here.

- Oh, you scared me.

- [Jesse] I bet I did.

- Yeah.

- [Jesse] Jesus,

you look fantastic.

- Thank you.

So do you.

- Thanks.

Yeah, security, right?

- [Abby] Great.

- Man, I knew I should

have asked you to prom.

- Right?

- For real.

- Um, well, I have a, I

have a thing to get to.

- Oh, yeah, right.

- Can I call you?

- Yeah, I would love that.

I have the same number.

- Yeah, I'll give you a call.

We'll hang out later.

- Awesome.

Just one more thing.

- Yeah?

- I'm gonna need you

to give me these chips.

- Excuse me?

- Come on, Abby.

You're underage.

You know you can't gamble

when you're underage.

It's illegal.

I don't wanna see

you get in trouble.

- Jesse, please.

I-I need this money.

- This is my job.

And I would hate to

see you go to jail.

Abby, give me the chips.

I'll totally cover you

with my boss, okay?

Call me.

(footsteps tapping)

(intense music)

(phone ringing)

- Hey.

- [Abby] It's Abby.

Are you at the club?

- Why, are you okay?

- I got caught.

- What?

- Listen to me, Dad.

Get out of the club.

Get out of town.

Don't use your cell phone.

Don't use any of

your credit cards

and text me when you get

a burner phone, okay?

We'll figure it out.

- [Mick] I guess

I'll leave tonight.

I'll hike to Denver.

- I'm so sorry, Dad.

I let you down.

- You called me.

You said you had my money.

- I had your money,

and then it was taken

from me by Jesse Viveros.

- And that is my problem how?

Where's Mick?

- He's gone, but we'll find him.

(motorcycle engine revving)

- Just go find Jesse.

Jesse has your money.

- I'm not a charity,

and I don't run errands.

- sh*t.

- You know what?

Abby, I like you.

You're nice.

So why don't you?

- What are you doing?

- Oh, I'm gay.

Trust me, you're not my type.

I will sponsor all of

your entrance fees.

The legal age in

California is 18,

and we'll split

the profits 50-50.

- Well, I don't wanna

play poker for a living.

I just wanna go to college.

- I'm offering you a compromise.

(door thudding)

- [Travis] Abby!

(door slams)

- What the f*ck?

- Travis?

- [Benny] Security.

- Are you okay?

- Hey, you got to

leave right now, okay?

(punches thudding)

(body thuds)

(Dane speaking in

foreign language)

(clothes ripping)

- What?

(lively music)

(both grunting)

(monitor clatters)

(both grunting)

(fists thudding)

- Travis?

- That's your one.

(Dane speaks in

foreign language)

(both grunting)

(head thuds)

(fist thuds)

(body thuds)

- You're good.

- Taxi.

- [Passerby] Call me, bro.

- Pigeon?

Pigeon?

Where are you going?

What the heck?

(elevator pings)

- Don't talk to me.

- Why?

Where are we going?

Will you talk to me?

Abby, stop!

- What?

What do you want?

- I, uh.

- Do you have any idea

what you just did?

- I wasn't gonna

let them hurt you.

- They weren't hurting

me, I was fine.

I was handling it on my own.

- How am I supposed to know

when you keep

everything a secret?

I had to track you down

to a strip club in Vegas.

One day you're

dressed like a nun,

and then you're wearing this.

Who the hell are you?

- God.

- [Travis] I love you.

- You love me?

You don't know me.

- That's not true.

Whatever you're going

through, we can figure it out.

- I don't wanna figure it out.

I've had enough

crazy in my life.

I don't want any more crazy.

And Travis, you make me crazy!

sh*t!

(body thud)

(upbeat music)

(both moaning)

(mirror shatters)

Get it out, get it out.

- I'm trying.

(tracker rips)

- (groans) sh*t.

Come here.

(Abby moans)

(glass shattering)

I'm so horny, I'm so horny.

- I'll try!

Okay, I'm trying, I'm trying!

(Travis thuds)

- Oh, sh*t.

- [Man] Hey, what the f*ck

is going on over there?

- Get these off.

What's wrong with your button?

- Hey, keep it down,

we're trying to sleep.

(Abby groans)

- Oh, oh, my gosh.

I'm so sorry, you all right?

I-I-I just needed

to take off my shoe.

- It's okay, come here.

(cabinet thud)

Aw.

- [Man] Hey, knock it off!

(lamp shatters)

- [Travis] Jesus.

- [Woman] What's

going on over there?

(phone ringing)

(cabinet clanking

and clattering)

- No.

(mirror thuds and shatters)

(phone ringing continues)

Go back.

- Yeah.

(water splashing)

(Abby gasps)

(sink crashing)

(cat meows)

- Oh, no, in here.

- Yeah.

(door banging)

- Take this off.

Help me get it.

- Yeah.

(shower knob squeaks)

(water splashing)

(Abby giggles)

(siren wailing)

- No.

(water splashing)

(cat meows)

(Abby groaning)

(clothes rip)

- Do you mind?

- Okay.

- Yeah, put it in.

- I don't think it's in.

- I-I don't think it's

in, I don't think.

- It's not in.

- Ow!

- Oh, sorry.

- Ow, okay, okay.

Yeah, no, hold on,

let's switch, switch.

- Ow!

- I can't feel anything.

- No, no.

- Let's get out of here.

- Okay.

(curtains rattles)

(phone vibrating)

- [Benny] Abby, Mick

still owes me 100 grand

and it's on you.

Call me.

(intense music)

(phone ringing)

Abby.

- No, it's her boyfriend.

Look, I-I know that

she owes you money,

but I think I have a way

to get it back to you.

- [Benny] I'm listening.

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

(Abby groans softly)

- Travis?

(phone message beeps)

(phone keys clacking)

What?

- Pigeon, don't be mad.

I worked out a deal with Benny.

I'm gonna fight for him

tonight and settle your debt.

You and your dad

are off the hook.

I left a rental car

in the parking garage

for you to get home.

I'll be back before you know it.

- sh*t.

(phone rings)

- [Travis] It's Travis,

you know what to do.

(phone beeps)

- Hey, it's me, call me back.

You have no idea what

you've gotten yourself into.

- I see you found my new car.

Pretty sick, right?

- Yeah, it's nice.

Tons of room in

there, I like that.

- Yeah, man.

- [Mick] So it went okay?

- Oh, she told me about it.

Handed over the

chips, no problem.

So what do you think

she's gonna do now?

She gonna start working

for Benny or what?

- Ah, yeah,

I don't think she has much

of a choice at this point.

(Jesse chuckles)

One of the greatest things

that I ever heard is

if you don't spot the chump

in the first 30 seconds,

then you are the chump.

I, uh, I wanna come see you

but I have no idea

where you are.

- [Abby] I'm in college.

- [Vince] It's about your dad.

- Mick still owes me 100

grand by midnight tonight.

- I'm gonna need you

to give me these chips.

- Get out of the club,

get out of town, okay?

We'll figure it out.

- [Mick] I guess I'll leave

tonight, I'll hike to Denver.

- You know, Abby, she's

looking pretty hot.

- [Mick] Can you not talk

about my daughter, thanks.

- No, no, I know.

I was just like, "Dang."

(Jesse grunts)

(taser crackles)

(body thuds)

- Ho, Abby, what are you.

- You son of a b*tch.

- What are you doing?

- How's Denver, Mick?

- What the hell?

Aw.

sh*t.

Obviously, I'm not in Denver.

That's not what I meant.

I'm going to Den, ow!

- You have two

seconds to come clean.

- To come clean about wha-ow!

- You, Benny, Jesse,

you guys set me up

from the beginning, didn't you?

- [Mick] Abby, Abby, I.

- You don't owe Benny

any f*cking money.

- Look at me, I'm

an old f*cking man.

I can't play as good

as you play, okay?

And I need money, I

need money to live.

- Then get a job

like a normal person.

- I know this doesn't

look good, okay?

I get it.

This does not look good.

- Yeah, right, yeah.

- I love you.

- Get out.

Get out!

- Okay.

- Get out!

Out of my life.

Get out!

- Can I get my bag?

- [Abby] Get out!

(tires screech)

- Abby!

(upbeat music)

(crowd cheering)

(punches and kicks thudding)

(fighter groaning)

(phone ringing)

- [Travis] It's Travis,

you know what to do.

(phone beeps)

- [Abby] Travis, call me back.

You don't have to fight.

No one owes Benny anything.

- And now, for the

first event this evening

we have something very special,

the challenger, Travis

"Mad Dog" Maddox!

(crowd chattering)

(crowd booing)

- Man, when you said

come out to Vegas,

I thought you

meant the Bellagio.

- [Man] Hey, I'm gonna f*ck

your mother, all right?

Mad Dog.

- Thanks, yeah.

Well, she's dead, so you can't.

(car engine revs)

(car door thuds)

(siren blaring)

- [Woman] The lockdown

is about to begin

in five, four, three, two.

- Is there any way

I can (indistinct)?

- Whore, whore!

- Okay.

Okay, I'm going, I'm going.

- And now, the

champion, Chernobyl!

(crowd cheering and applauding)

- [Both] What the f*ck.

(crowd cheering and applauding)

- You're going to die.

- Thank you.

(crowd cheering and applauding)

- Whoever dies, loses.

- [Crowd] Chernobyl, Chernobyl.

- How's it going?

- [Crowd] Chernobyl, Chernobyl.

- Awesome.

- Come on, can we go?

Please.

- Shut up!

(man belches)

(Abby sighs)

(Chernobyl growls)

- This is gonna suck.

- Yeah, wow.

- Let the battle begin.

(intense music)

(kicks and punches thudding)

- [Shepley] Yeah, there you go.

There you go.

- Come on!

- Whoo-hoo.

- What?

(Travis grunts)

Stay in it.

(fists thudding)

Nice, way to go.

There you go!

(fist thuds)

(Travis groaning)

(crowd cheering)

- Here, I'll pay for him.

(man smooch)

(kick thuds)

- [Shepley] Nice kick!

There you go, there you go.

(kick thuds)

Nice, give him the combo.

(Chernobyl grunts)

- [Chernobyl] No

b*tch, Chernobyl.

- You can't use a chain.

What is this?

(Travis grunts)

- Ref!

Stop the fight.

(punches thudding)

This is bullshit.

(chains clank)

(intense music)

(both grunt)

Come here, you son of a b*tch.

(punches thudding)

(heads thud)

(Shepley grunts)

- [Abby] Can I get

through, please?

- No, whoa!

- [Shepley] Oh, sh*t.

(Travis grunts)

(kick thuds)

That's my boy, man. (groans)

- sh*t.

(bottle cracks)

(electricity crackles)

(kick thuds)

(Shepley groans)

(Chernobyl growling)

(crowd cheering)

(flames crackling)

(Chernobyl growling)

(chair thuds)

(crowd shouting)

- sh*t, fire!

(flames crackling)

- Fire, fire!

(flames whooshing)

- Oh, God!

- Hey.

- Abby?

- Hi.

- Shepley, come on.

- Come on.

- Come on.

(Shepley groans)

- I talked to Shepley

and he's fine.

I'll be on the first

flight to Vegas tomorrow.

Hey, just a thought,

but maybe you wanna check

into the Mirage or the Luxor.

I-I hear they have deals.

- It's fine.

Benny's not gonna do anything.

His scam didn't work out

and no one owes him a dime.

Mer, you just have to trust me.

Bye.

- I don't know if I ever

wanna leave this bed, pigeon.

- Hey, Travis?

- Hm?

- Why do you call me pigeon?

- You don't know

what a pigeon is?

- Yeah, it's an annoying bird

that craps on people's heads.

- No.

It's a dove, an

attractive girl, a.

- A winning hand in poker.

- See?

You're my pigeon.

- I'm an exhausted pigeon.

- I bet.

- You?

- I'm gonna stay up

for a little while.

- Oh.

Are you scared I'm

gonna disappear again

if you go to sleep?

- It crossed my mind.

- I love you.

I love you, Travis Maddox.

- You love me?

- It's the tattoos.

- They're pretty cool.

(Abby giggles)

Sure you wanna do this?

- (scoffs) Dude, I

was born to ride.

- You got some brain

damage back there.

- (scoffs) I love you, Mommy.

Hey, I'll see you

back at the ranch.

- What?

- Corn.

(motorbike engine revs)

Ah, let's see what

this puppy can do.

(cans clattering)

- Is he gonna be okay?

- [Shepley] Yee-ha!

- No.

- [Shepley] I need to

get me one of these.

Whoo!

- [Travis] Whose bag is this?

- Jesse's.

- Who's Jesse?

- I love this thing.

- Doesn't matter.

(objects clanking)

- Does Jesse have a shirt?

- He might.

- He does have a shirt.

- Hey.

- It's not my favorite style.

A little loud but.

He also has a ton

of money in here.

- Actually, no, that's my money.

- You won this?

- Yeah.

Told you I'm good.

- Yeah.

So then, this is yours too?

- Mm-hm.

- You have great taste.

(Abby laughs)

Here's to you.

Ow.

- Here's to us.

- How's my face?

- Ooh.

You look better already.

Vegas for another night?

- That would be a disaster.

Let's do it.
