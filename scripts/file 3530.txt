- Are you there?

- (Carla gasping)

MARIAN: Just wondering,

are you and Sukie

- going to shot night tonight?

- CARLA: Oh, my God!

MARIAN: I don't want to be

stuck there not knowing anyone.

Maybe Carla's going.

Do you know if Carla's going?

Are you going?

(grunting)

MARIAN: Anyway,

call me if you would.

Come on, back to mama.

MARIAN: Hope you and Sukie

are doing well.

Miss you, friend. It's Marian.

Hey. Marian.

Hi, Bart.

Say, what are you doing

tomorrow night?

There's a Phish concert.

What?

Phish concert.

Great jam band,

at the Civic Center.

Yeah, oh, I...

P-H.

I know how to spell Phish.

Y-Yeah, of course.

I didn't mean to...

- Y-You know, I just meant...

- Sorry, I have an engagement.

Okay. Bummer. (chuckles)

Didn't mean to, you know...

That's fine.

Anyhoo, what about...

Please don't use

that expression.

- What expression?

- "Anyhoo."

(laughs):

It's not an expression.

What is it?

A word.

Please don't use that word.

Okay. You-you free Wednesday?

Plus, it's not even a word.

Not really.

Okay, sure.

Free for dinner Wednesday?

There's a new place

near me, Montana's.

It's very good.

Yeah, the food is trendy,

but it's super gourmet.

No, I have an engagement

Wednesday.

Okay. Huh. Wednesday, too.

People don't usually

call them "engagements."

Do I tell you how to speak?

Yes.

The fact remains.

The engagement.

That's right.

Yes, I am going tonight.

SUKIE: During sex?

(Carla moaning, panting)

- Hi, Sukie.

- SUKIE: Wow.

(busy signal)

- Who? Here?

- SUKIE: Yes, there.

Oh, no one's here, babe.

- I was just masturbating.

Me... me time.

CARLA: No.

- MARIAN: What?

- No.

No what, Carla?

You're not wearing that.

- I just came from work.

- I came from Toledo.

I don't dress like it.

- Is Jamie here?

- Okay, look.

Keep the coat on.

Take the shirt off underneath.

And flaunt my breasts?

I'm not here to peddle my wares.

Why else would you be here?

To socialize.

- (feedback squeals)

- DJ: Hello, girls.

(cheering)

All I hear lately is "Y2K, Y2K."

But Jamie Dobbs

is here to say...

Why not 2K?

(cheering)

New millennium, bring it on.

(cheering)

Oh, yeah. It's the last

body shot competition of 1999

here at Sugar 'n Spice,

and Jamie is

last month's winner,

so we are gonna salt you up.

(cheering)

Show us where

the first lick goes, babe.

(sighs) So, first lick...

Here.

(cheering)

God, look at that sl*t.

Oh. Hi, Sukie.

SUKIE: Don't put that woman

in front of a crowd

with a microphone.

- JAMIE: And then second lick...

- Well, she likes to entertain.

WOMAN: Ooh!

Take it off! Take it off!

(cheering, excited shouting)

Here.

(cheering)

And then she gets

this reinforcement.

- JAMIE: And then third lick...

- Do you know who she's f*cking?

I don't know that

she's seeing anyone.

She's seeing you, of course.

WOMAN: Can I have your shirt?

Here.

(cheering)

She's a free spirit.

- I admire her.

- (scoffs)

Free.

Yeah, that's the problem.

Put a meter on her p*ssy,

we could all retire!

That's not fair, Sukie.

And a lime wedge... right here!

(cheering)

Pull that out!

That is not a public receptacle!

- Somebody's gonna get hit.

- JAMIE: Oh. Hi, Sukie.

- (punch lands, body thuds)

- (crowd gasping)

JAMIE:

I've had it with love.

I know bards and troubadours

are high on it,

but I don't believe

it's relevant to the modern

20th... soon-to-be 21st...

Century lesbian.

Here are some carrots.

Those peas are thawed.

- This right here is what it gets you.

- Mm-hmm.

So I've hatched a plan,

my friend.

If you'll come help me

move my sh*t

out of Sukie's tomorrow...

I'm not getting

in the middle of that.

I have my own problems.

What problems?

Internal.

- Internal?

- Yes.

I don't know how else to put it.

Problems with

what I feel internally.

How can you have

internal problems?

You got your a*s all bricked up.

I'm not certain, honey darling,

that you have ever

reached deep inside any orifice

to scoop out your soul

and fling it shamelessly

at a fellow human being

and humiliate yourself

and grovel and weep

and feel your ego

completely disintegrate,

otherwise known as

the glory of love.

Please don't eat those peas.

Now, my plan is:

you come help me pack,

- and then we two...

- I can't. I'm leaving town.

What? I am, too.

That was my plan.

Where are you going?

Tallahassee, Florida.

Why would anybody go

to Tallahassee, Florida?

My Aunt Ellis lives there.

Can't she move?

Tallahassee is very nice.

It's not glitzy and gross

like Miami.

It has live oak

and Spanish moss.

Me and Aunt Ellis go to

the St. Marks Wildlife Preserve.

There's good birding.

Birding?

How have I missed out on this?

It's very pleasant.

So you just came up with this

wild hair in your a*s to bird.

I've been unhappy,

and I'm starting to snap

at people at work,

and it's not fair to them.

I'm only impatient with myself.

Well, we can fix that.

We'll have you running right

in no time.

That's why we take

this trip together, honey babe.

We get our sh*t together, together.

See, I was gonna take

some time off,

get a drive-away,

just go potluck anywhere.

Now you can come with me,

and we can go to Tallahassee

and bird.

What's a drive-away?

Free one-way rental.

You deliver the car

to wherever some client

of the drive-away company

wants it,

if they got one going

near your destination.

I don't know

if you'll like Aunt Ellis.

Are you kidding? A birder?

I'll wear

my great big old straw hat,

and she is going to

L-O-V-E love me.

You know how

parents and such love me.

They think I got charisma.

"Oh, Marian,

who's your loquacious friend?

"I just love that

chatty little girl.

Isn't she something?"

I'm not sure.

Don't go finding a problem here.

This is going to be

F-U-N-N fun, girl.

Just come help me move my stuff

out of Sukie's tomorrow.

Don't worry,

she's not even gonna be there.

SUKIE: Oh, God!

- (sobbing): Take it! Oh, God!

- (power drill whirring)

Sukie, don't.

What are you doing?

- I don't want it anymore.

- (dog barking)

(hushed): You said

she wouldn't be here.

Sukie, I'm just taking

my own stuff.

That was a gift.

I wanted you to have it.

I don't want it if we're not

going to both use it!

Sukie, it's your wall dildo.

No, no, no, no.

And take Alice, too.

I never liked her.

And she won't stop barking!

How can I take the dog, Sukie?

I don't have a home.

Remember, you kicked me out?

(continues sobbing)

Take Alice. Take the wall dildo.

It's your dildo, Susanne.

(Alice barks, growls)

Curlie's Drive-Away,

Pennsylvania's most trusted

name in car delivery.

Curlie speaking.

MAN (on phone): Okay,

it's going to Tallahassee.

Uh-huh. Tallahassee, Florida.

Yeah, you have something

to write this down?

Yes, I'm writing it down.

To 14 Tinywick Road.

Right.

Tallahassee.

Sure.

You got it?

- Right. Got it.

- Can you help us?

And it's got to be there

by end of day tomorrow.

By tomorrow.

No later.

Uh-huh.

Okay.

Okay.

Over and out.

Can you help us?

We need a drive-away.

$250 deposit and a reference.

A reference?

Somebody local

I can break his ba*ls

if you don't show up

where you're supposed to.

His ba*ls.

Can the reference be a woman?

We don't know a lot of men.

No kidding.

- Where do you want to go?

- Tallahassee.

Tallahassee?

What's wrong with Tallahassee?

It's very nice.

There's Spanish moss

and live oak.

I think Curlie here...

Don't call me Curlie.

Isn't your name Curlie?

My name is Curlie.

We just met. It's too familiar.

Have you ever been

to Tallahassee?

No, I got good sense.

- Your car is a Dodge Aries.

- Oh.

Okay. Is that a good car?

Not really.

You sell those shirts?

JAMIE: There's also a place

here in Wilmington...

Fantastic d*ke bar,

the Butter Churn.

And this place,

Levi's Barbecue in Charleston.

Memphis-style barbecue,

really good.

Everyone goes

to Charlie Vergos',

- but it's just...

- Jamie.

It's a straight shot

to Tallahassee.

Down and across.

Right here's the world's

largest Dixie cup

outside of Mitchell, Georgia.

MARIAN:

Direct route, down and across.

We don't need to see

the world's largest Dixie cup.

We don't need to enjoy life,

but as long as we're here...

The world's largest Dixie cup

is not life.

It's a straight shot on

the interstate, down and across.

The interstate is not life.

It is, more than

the world's largest Dixie cup.

You're the one that wanted to go birding.

That's nature.

What's a d*ke bar?

That's not nature?

Even a Dixie cup,

you could make an argument.

He said it was a rush job.

We're supposed to have

the car there tomorrow.

Tomorrow can wait a day.

We could even go to Miami.

Bikinis and high heels.

(engine revs, tires squeal)

A medical doctor?

Or a reverend?

Yeah, no, we don't have

a discount for men of God, no.

No, not for medical doctors, either.

Make up your mind...

Which are you?

It doesn't matter.

We have no discounts.

Our everyday low prices

are already rock bottom.

Thank you for calling Curlie's.

Welcome to Curlie's Drive-Away.

Well, we're here.

Okay. Who are you?

- The car.

- The car?

The Dodge Aries.

The Dodge Aries?

What are you, a mynah bird?

I'm Curlie.

I understand that.

You're not the Dodge.

What do you mean,

we're not the Dodge?



(doors open and close)

(engine starts, tires squeal)

What's the big deal?

The car isn't ours.

But it's art, and the car

is ours till Tallahassee.

And once we get to Tallahassee, it stops

being art and starts being vandalism.

Fuckety-f*ck's sake, Marian,

it'll come off with a little

- soap and water.

- It won't.

- Won't what?

- Come off with soap and water.

- Well, how do you know?

- I tried.

Marian, it's art.

Stop saying it's art.

That doesn't end all discussion.

We're gonna be driving through

some conservative towns...

The South.

- The Bible Belt.

- Mm, don't I know it.

Honey, I grew up

where the Bible Belt

meets the a*s crack

of the Pecos River.

Fort Worth is nowhere near

the "Pay-cos" River.

That's "Peck-us," honey darling.

And the car art is just a part

of my larger undertaking.

My project.

What's your project?

Loosening you up so we can

get you laid, sugar sweet.

How long's it been?

Weeks?

Months?

Oh, my God, Marian.

Don't tell me it's been years.

H-How many years? Who was it?

You've had sex since

what's-her-name, haven't you?

Donna.

Yeah, Donna.

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God. Donna?

(sighs)

She work for Al Gore now?

Nader.

That's right.

She just looks like Al Gore.

CURLIE:

Wait a minute.

You said people of yours

would come in for it.

Yes, I did.

You call with a drop-off

in Tallahassee,

and then these broads come in

and say they're ready

to go to Tallahassee.

You gave them the car.

You don't know who they were?

CURLIE:

I told you their names.

Their names, yes, but...

This place is a dump.

They drive the car

instead of you.

Is that bad?

Bad if they find the goods.

This place is a pigsty.

Why don't you get a girl in?

CURLIE:

I like clutter.

They didn't have

a cellular phone?

Sterile doesn't work for me.

He asked you a question,

d*ck-yank.

- d*ck-yank?

- CHIEF: Flint.

I'm a d*ck-yank?

Don't antagonize.

It's like talking

to a bucket of wet cement.

You wouldn't know wet cement

if it bit you in the a*s.

And you would?

So, there's no way

to get in contact with them?

(footsteps approaching)

Not per se.

"Per se"?!

They left a local number.

Everybody's got to leave

a local number.

Someone whose ba*ls I can break.

Now you've gone and done it.

2431 North Garnet.

You better hope your friends

deliver that car.

Tomorrow.

(grunting and groaning continue)

(sighs) This is great.

This is so slutty.

I love this.

- Hope they have postcards.

- Uh, Jamie?

All right,

let's put on our w*r paint.

The Butter Churn awaits.

Jamie, I think I'd prefer to...

No. No, don't even.

You come with me.

I'll show you how this is done.

(chatter in foreign language,

audience laughter over  TV)

(door opens, closes)

Hiya. Do you know

where the Butter Churn is?

It's a d*ke bar.

Or do you have, like,

a Time Out Wilmington?

I mean, is there one with,

uh, gay/lesbian listings?

You wouldn't have one,

but do you know

if there's a newsstand

or a lesbian bookstore?

You know, Sapphic Wonders,

something like that?

Hello?

(engine idling)

- (engine shuts off)

- (muffled music playing inside)

JAMIE: Confidence.

You got to show that you're

comfortable with the physical.

This isn't like meeting somebody

at a NOW convention,

where you talk about

dismantling the patriarchy.

Jamie, I have done this before.

It's just like this.

One message.

You dig the female body.

Your body.

You're like this.

Not like this.

"Let's dismantle

the patriarchy."

I have done this before.

I am not a schoolmarm.

You f*ck people

that work for Ralph Nader.

- Not only.

- Only in the last four years.

Three years.

And four months and 14 days.

Okay.

Yeah, it tasted real good,

but it stuck to my teeth...

You feeling your body?

Very much so.

Okay.

Peanut, peanut butter...

They all look fine.

Fine?

Like, "You'll do"?

"Please, please

come home with me, baby.

"You seem totally okay.

Are there any other mediocre

ones like you at home?"

I didn't say

they all looked mediocre.

I said they all looked fine.

Yeah, but not in

the sense of "super fine."

In the sense of

"fine, whatever."

Why are you jousting with me?

I'm not jousting.

I'm asking which of these women

you want to throw up

against the wall

and f*ck like

there's no tomorrow.

Look, Jamie, I'm not a

"throw up against the wall

and f*ck the daylights out of"

kind of person.

Stop trying to make me

something I'm not.

I'm just trying to

get you laid, sugar sweet.

They sense it,

whether you want to f*ck them

or you think they're just fine.

I have to be me.

It has to be done

with authenticity.

- You mean with authority.

- I mean with authenticity.

Authenticity gets you somebody

that works for Ralph Nader.

You don't know

what our life was like.

You know nothing

about its worth.

Then why didn't

the two of you move

to Santa Fe and synchronize

your menstrual cycles?

That didn't happen.

That's why you're here

in a d*ke bar

looking for cheap, sleazy sex.

No, I'm not.

This is not me.

You're right.

I can't do this.

No, Marian.

I'm sorry, honey girl.

I-I'm saying you can do this.

You can do this.

You can be cheap.

I promise, honey girl.

Your best self.

Jamie, I know

you're well-intentioned,

but this really isn't

right for me.

You should stay and enjoy

your night on the town.

Yeah, come on,

open up that jar...

who can do that.

Black belts in cunnilingus.

They can even

cunniling themselves.

They got pictures of it

You got to ask the librarian.

They don't keep 'em

in the stacks.

Who wrote your book?

Henry James...

American writer.

Famous family. His brother, too.

Rick?

No, I'm kidding.

I know who Henry James is.

White and uptight.

Portrait of a Lady in school.

Boy, that was a great read.

spaghetti across my tits.

That's a very apt simile.

- Yeah.

Put me off the whole book thing.

Henry James is, in fact,

Uh-huh, yeah. I don't think you should've

I don't know.

It was a slumber party.

Little old for slumber parties,

aren't you, miss?

(sighs) Look, mister...

("Never Nowhere"

You know what?

I'm gonna drop you off at home.

Aw.

you know it...

("Blue Bayou"

by Linda Ronstadt playing)

Gonna see my baby again

Gonna be with

some of my friends

Maybe I'll feel better again

Saving nickels, saving dimes

Working till

Looking forward

to happier times

I'm going back someday

Come what may

(distorted laughing)

(distorted, indistinct chatter)



WOMAN (distorted):

Hey, handsome.

(distorted chatter continues)

(echoing):

Hey, handsome.

Want to get plastered?

(projector rattling)

GOON: I'll drive

when it's my turn.

- At the end of three hours.

- (snorts)

I have no sympathy for you,

my friend.

You could've just asked her,

and you'd be fine right now.

- (snorting)

- I just asked. She answered.

But you cannot relate

to the public,

which, in a service profession,

is a big f*cking handicap.

- (snorting)

- And that sound

is beginning to get irritating.

Well, your lectures

are getting irritating.

I don't lecture, my friend.

That's my point.

I take people in. I react.

I read people

to get what I want.

You, though,

you think life is this

orderly series of people

to beat the sh*t out of.

(chuckling): Well, real life

is not like that.

You only see it that way

because you're not nourished

by human contact, the human

give-and-take, so forth.

Uh-uh. "Me want, me take."

That's what you're

comfortable with.

- Yeah, yeah.

- Caveman sh*t.

You don't engage

the whole person.

Well, you did a great job

helping me engage

that very agile harpy.

(chuckles) Didn't have to.

No need whatsoever

for the physical approach,

which you couldn't see

because you don't savor

the stuff of life.

I'm not a sissy boy,

if that's what you mean.

- Kiss my a*s. I...

- (cell phone ringing)

- Hello?

- CHIEF: Okay, we're on track.

Marian Pallavi was picked up

for vagrancy

last night in Marietta, Georgi.

- Just north of Atlanta.

- On it.

Georgia.

Thank you.

For what?

Just picking me up.

Am I not gonna pick you up?

Hard not to.

"Ma'am, your friend here is in the

hoosegow. Care to come get her?"

I'll come get you

all day, every day.

I will not let a friend of mine

rot in prison

longer than is

absolutely necessary.

And so I say thank you.

Course, you ain't told me

how you come to be in prison,

and I've been careful

not to ask,

but damn, Marian,

landing yourself in prison is

a very hopeful sign for you.

I think it was jail, not prison.

Oh. I'm sorry.

Uh, you ain't told me

how you come to be in jail.

It wasn't hell-raising.

Sorry to disappoint.

A policeman didn't like my tone.

Oh.

You copped some attitude.

I don't have attitude.

Marian, if I may,

there are certain things in life

which you got to sense

and understand

in order to live life,

and one of the things that

you got to understand is, uh...

well, all these

funny little creatures

that you probably noticed

walking around on two legs,

we call 'em human beings.

Got to understand

what makes 'em tick.

And your whole social situation,

you got to understand

what that is.

Uh-huh.

You know what that means?

"Social situation"?

I know what

"social situation" means.

Okay, good.

So, the whole thing

with a cop is...

And you should remember this

for future reference...

When you're in

a social situation with a cop,

there ain't no social situation.

There's a "keep your f*cking

mouth shut" situation.

There's a "yes, sir" situation

is what there is.

Believe me, honey doll,

I've been dating a cop

for two years now, and...

I ain't talking through

my vulva here.

Thank you. I understand.

But if authority

is being abused,

- there's an obligation to...

- Holy sh*t.

Florida.

Lesbian...

don't let the sun

go down on you here.

(electrical buzzing)

(tire pops loudly)

(screaming)

(horns honking)

- (Marian groans)

- (screaming stops)

(horn honking)

(both breathe deeply)

BOTH: You okay?

Spare tire.



What?

Something burning?

Jamie, it's cold.

Don't touch it.

I saw this movie once where

they come across this box,

the people in the movie,

and they opened the box,

and it was, like,

really, really bad.

Head!

(screaming)

(laughter)

No, I'm kidding.

It was a minor traffic accident.

Fast stop.

His, uh, face hit the wheel.

Looking at a pretty girl,

weren't you, Flint?

(laughter)

No more looking at

pretty girls for you, right?

(laughter)

That's right.

So, are they, like,

wanted or something?

Oh, no, no. No, they're not

in trouble at all.

Just drove off

with something we need.

Didn't even know they had it.

So, what were you all

doing here last night?

- Just making out.

- (light laughter)

(chuckling): Oh, yeah?

With who?

(laughter)

No kiss-and-tell, huh?

(laughs)

Anyway, we need to find

those girls to get our...

sample case back.

And when we heard Doreen here

paid Marian's fine, we thought,

well, you girls might know

where they're headed.

How did you know about

its being Doreen's check?

We have contacts

in law enforcement.

No, no.

We should just call the cops.

We will, Jamie.

First, we should see

what's in here.

Why? I don't want to look.

- Why do I have to look?

- Jamie, listen.

Whoever sliced that head off

knows who we are.

This might tell us who they are,

so we won't be

at a disadvantage.

The police can find out,

and the police can protect us.

Protect us?

They're not the Secret Service,

and we're not Chelsea Clinton.

What do we lose by looking?

Look.

I just want to know

what's going on.

This might tell us.

I bet it's locked.

(latch clicks)



- We got to call the cops.

- Why?

That was awful.

You just said

not to call the cops.

In ignorance.

No, what you said was true.

The cops could think

you're involved.

You just spent

the night in jail.

For vagrancy.

We wouldn't have anything

to do with... that.

Okay, honey, cool your jets.

Here's what we do.

First, we get to Tallahassee.

ALL (laughing): Bye!

How about next time,

you let me do all the talking?

Sure, gassing is

what you're good at.

Well it sure as hell

ain't what you're good at.

I'm not a suck-up or a salesman.

Uh-huh.

You think you would've gotten

the address

where they're headed?

I don't think so, Mr. Sunshine.

Okay, we've got

some hard driving to do.

- (car doors close)

- ALL: Bye!

(gentle piano music playing)

Welcome to El Conquistador.

Yeah, hiya. Do you have a room

for two right away?

Uh, we do have one available.

Yes. How many nights?

Well, tonight,

and then we'll play it by ear.

You take the Rainbow Card?

Uh, I'm sure we do.

Yes, actually, that's just

a, uh, Visa specialty card.

Yeah, but they give

a percentage of each purchase

to gay, lesbian, bi,

transgender charities.

You do that, right?

Well, the issuer would be

the one to take care of that.

Do you have

a super reinforced safe

for sensitive materials?

We do have in-room safes

for any valuables

that you may have.

This place is

lesbian-friendly, right?

Uh, yes. Uh, well, sure.

We're friendly to anyone

who wants to stay.

Do you have ice?

("I Love You"

Afraid of the stuff of life?

Lovin' another guy

Ooh, babe

I love you

Ooh, babe

I love you...

Is this, um... Slappy's?

That's right.

Have you seen two, um,

nonlocal women come in here?

That's one of them.

I was sittin' here listening

to Junior Kimbrough

a couple years back.

One girl come in here,

appear to be to me a half local.

I don't recollect two

come in here any time recent.

Now, that's true.

Love will bite your a*s.

Ooh, babe

I love you.

JAMIE: Oh, I can send Sukie.

But why would these people

just be waiting there

in the drive-away office?

Well, clearly, this was not

your garden-variety

decapitation.

This was some kind of a...

Well, I don't know what it was,

but they know

we have their stuff.

Yeah?

Look, Marian,

they can't find us.

Maybe they're waiting

for us to find them.

That's the only place

we'd know to call.

But why would we get

in touch with them?

Sell it back, shake 'em down.

Which, incidentally,

is not such a bad idea.

Jamie.

Look, I didn't invent extortion.

But, Jamie,

why would Susanne help us?

She hates you.

Oh, she's had

two days to cool off.

Get the f*ck back

in that lockup.

Officer Kracik said

I could speak to my attorney.

Attorney?

Are you a college boy?

Officer Kracik said

I could speak to my lawyer.

Officer Kracik

ain't running booking.

I'm running booking, jackass.

- He said...

- You want me to walk over there

and kick your number-running a*s

back into

the Delaware f*cking River?

Who's running booking?

- You are.

- Who is?

- You are.

- No f*cking sh*t!

Hey. It's me.

Oh, what a lovely surprise.

Sukie, come on, now.

Let's be friends. I...

Did the two creeps find you?

What?

The two weirdos looking for you.

I tried to be helpful.

Uh, but who were they?

How should I know?

Bill collectors,

herpes patients.

Two more people

you f*cked over somehow.

- George and Lennie.

- George and Lennie?

Of Mice and Men.

Have you read any books?

Books, maybe not, but, sweetie,

I'm gonna help you break

a big m*rder case.

- "Break a big m*rder case"?

- (indistinct radio chatter)

JAMIE: Just go over

to Curlie's Drive-Away.

Curlie's Drive-Away?

Yeah.

- And you ask Curlie about...

- (radio warbling)

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Turn that down!

Ask him about the what

in the attach case?

You should see what they got

locked up in that thing.

(chuckles) Jamie, that is about

the dumbest thing

I've ever heard, and I'm a cop.

Why would I make it up?

Just go to Curlie's Drive-Away.

I guarantee you someone's there.

You guarantee?

I'm supposed to believe you?

Fine. You know what?

If no one's there,

I'll take Alice.

Really? Swear?

Yes, I swear. I p*ssy-promise.

I will take the dog.

You'll never have to deal

with her again.

CHIEF (over phone):

A juke joint where?

Wetumpka, Alabama.

Well, outside of Wetumpka.

They hadn't been there,

but a very personable

music lover

told us of another juke joint

- fairly close by called...

- You see?

Stop!

Called Ike's.

Maybe he said "Mike's."

Maybe he said "Mike."

Uh, "Mike" or... But whatever.

I think the soccer team

was just confused

about which joint

these girls were going to,

so we're gonna drive...

Stop saying words.

One of the girls

finally used a credit card.

They arrived in Tallahassee

and checked into a hotel

called El Conquistador.

Tallahassee.

I want you to get

your asses over there

and take care of it right away.

Not a juke joint.

You should arrive

by early morning.

I'll meet you there.

Uh, I'll level with you, Chief.

Flint and me could use

a little shut-eye.

We have not slept

since the night before last,

- and we...

- (click, dial tone)

Hello?

- Chief?

- Who's in Tallahassee?

DESK CLERK:

Certainly.

There are a number of places

I can recommend locally,

or right here at the hotel,

we have Espadrilles

for casual dining,

or we have Baxter's by the Pool,

which is our more elegant venue

down in the lower level.

Maybe we should stay here.

Replenish the ice.

(piano playing

"Fly Me to the Moon")

This is great, but how...

Ladies, are we enjoying

a beverage this evening?

(softly):

Rainbow.

Yes.

Uh, can we get

some champagne, please?

Like, a really, really good one?

WAITER: Of course.

Won't you have to pay

for the card at some point?

Theoretically.

(Jamie sighs)

So...

I've been thinking

about it, and...

finally dawned on me that

you are not the kind of person

that a girl brings to

a roadside motel for a quickie.

Now, I have heard of

the more soulful sex

where you have a nice dinner

and conversation first

so it all comes out of

someplace deeper,

but I usually have stuff to do.

Perrier-Jout Belle Epoque '95.

You mean you want

to sleep with me?

Marian, you have got to have

a good, steamy f*ck.

- (cork pops)

- Something I decided

last night

while I was lying in bed

before I started masturbating,

and I figure,

it's important to me,

I should take care of it myself.

Especially since, with you,

it's got to be with somebody

who cares for you.

Am I right?

Can't just be a finger

jiggling your clit and adios.

- Thank you.

- WAITER: My pleasure. Madame?

Yes, please.

But is it a good idea

for us to have sex?

I mean, we're good friends,

and maybe it's not supposed

to be more than that.

Maybe we shouldn't risk

ruining it.

Look, you can always find

reasons to not have sex,

and if you think about them

too much, guess what.

- You never have sex.

- Exactly.

Like my high school

guidance counselor.

She was always saying

that this or that

- would be inappropriate.

- Uh-huh.

But when I finally

got her to relax,

the sex was great.

Ladies, have we decided?

Don't rush us, buddy.

First, we'll dance.

("You Belong to Me"

by Diana Krall playing)

Maybe I do overthink things.

Yeah.

Got to keep that brain loose,

let that mind fly.

(sighs softly)

There was this one time

I was with Debbie Augenblick.

Ah, you know Debbie.

She's got this humongous dildo

she's got mounted

on a Black & Decker

circular sander,

and she had me going

like my brains were gonna

come out the top

of my freaking skull.

I mean, I came like the

Grand Burlington motherfuck...

(moaning continues)

(moans softly)



GOON: One accomplishment.

Huh? Name me one.

At least I'm in the arena

dealing with people.

Those girls wound you up

like a top.

Flint, have you ever

f*cked a woman

on a creaky porch swing

on a warm summer evening...

Crickets, so forth?

I mean, just f*cked her

like there's no tomorrow,

trousers around your ankles,

belt jangling,

yelling to beat the band,

slamming away

like a Cincinnati jackhammer.

Yes, people might stroll by

and see you

looking foolish up there

slapping ham on the veranda,

but that is the price you pay

for interaction.

If this is too messy for you,

then you will spend

the rest of

your miserable f*cking life

just hitting people and then

pulling your measly little pud.

Can't wait to tell the chief.

Yeah, and why don't you

also tell him

that you're

a social f*cking imbecile

that I've been carrying

on my back

all the way from Philadelphia!

(grunts, moans)

Oh, my God.

CHAUFFEUR: Sir?

- Sir.

- Hmm?

Tallahassee, sir.

- Where to, exactly?

- (sighs)

Yes, um...

The track.

Dog track? Yes, sir.

Those penises are trouble,

Jamie.

JAMIE:

Oh, come on now.

I thought you were

gonna loosen up.

You gonna work your way

through all of them?

No. I like this one.

Oh, come on. Don't be mad.

Last night was beautiful,

but you fell asleep

and I didn't get my turn

on the waterslide,

if you know what I'm saying.

- Okay! -All right!

- (Jamie and Marian screaming)

Everyone, relax. Stay calm.

We're here for two things.

- (screaming continues)

- (grunts)

Careful with that thing,

you f*cking moron!

- Screw you!

- (screaming)

We're here for two items.

Whoa. She's naked.

All right, no big deal.

Just a naked lady.

We're here for two items.

Yes, this. Please and thank you.

- And the head box.

- Head box!

f*ck you!

Don't you f*cking lecture me!

All right, ladies.

No need to panic. One more time.

Please and thank you.

We're all friends here.

Two items. Don't panic. Okay.

Let's get this show on the road.

(screaming continues)

Yeah, baby.

You're such a big, bouncy,

beautiful baby.

Love doesn't have to die, baby.

Whoa.

This is so groovy.

Now I can love you forever.

Whoa.

And ever

and ever and ever

- and ever and ever.

- And ever and ever.

Never to wilt, never to wane.

BOTH: Never to wilt,

never to wane.

Never to wilt, never to wane.

(echoing): Never to wilt,

never to wane.

Never to wilt, never to wane.

Never to wilt...

(bell rings)

(snarling)

Took 'em straight here.

Haven't debriefed 'em, Chief.

Figured you want to do

the talking.

This is all they had?

What's all they had?

Ladies, you're a day late

and a d*ck short.

GOON:

What are you talking about?

The senator's p*nis

is not in the case!

- Not in the...

- Well, that just figures.

Come on, girls.

Where's the last phallus?

(muffled chattering)

You didn't check the case

before you left?

I-I...

He's been stepping on his d*ck

the whole way down, Chief.

What have you done, jerk-off?

I got the Spanish guy's head,

Einstein!

They gave you the combination,

and it still took you

15 minutes!

- FLINT: I never slip up.

- GOON: Right, left,

- past the first number.

- (yells)

(snarling)

The senator is a good man.

He smoked marijuana

once in college.

Many of us did.

- It was a different time.

- (muffled muttering)

He went to a party

and met a hippie chick,

Tiffany Plaster Caster.

Housekeeping.

(snarling)

She took a plaster cast

of his excited...

thing.

She made one model

of each of her "old men."

(beeping)

At the time, the senator

didn't know that someday

he'd be called on to serve

his community, his state,

and perhaps someday, his nation.

He was just a kid.

(humming an upbeat tune)

His p*nis passed

from hand to hand.

Finally ended up

with an international collector

named

Alejandro Santos y Obrador.

(hushed):

You saw him, sort of.

(continues humming)

(stops humming)

(housekeeper screaming)

This p*nis cannot become

a piece of merchandise.

Think of it: eBay,

"Senator Gary Channel's

ding-dong, lightly used."

Comments, reviews.

Think of what

it would do to him.

His children, his family,

his career.

(gasps)

- (g*ons yelling in distance)

- We're not unreasonable.

We'll gladly pay for it.

We just...

Will you please shut up!

That wasn't my idea!

I was just trying

to keep us awake.

I was experimenting.

But you liked it.

- FLINT: No, I didn't!

- I could tell.

Hey, it was the Irish coffee.

I was drunk!

Drunk on c*ck.

- FLINT: No! I didn't.

- It's not my thing.

I was just trying

to help you be a man.

- To understand life.

- No!

- The stuff of life!

- No, no, no!

what are you doing?!

get back to the hotel

out of the bed.

Then we switch hotels.

Yes. Who is this?

Somebody who wants

a million dollars.

If you can get it by tonight,

you can have your thing back.

Everybody's things.

I'll tell you where to bring

the money. Come alone.

If you're not alone,

believe me, I'll know it.

Someone named Jamie Dobbs

made a phone call

from here last night.

Uh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

Well, this is for her.

Oh, I'm sorry, miss.

You've missed them.

Um, her-her friend

just checked them out.



JAMIE: Done.

With what?

Tell you later.

I'm gonna clean up.

Want to join me?

I want...

Uh-huh?

What do you want, sugar sweet?

I want to make love

with the senator's p*nis.

I made a cast.

And two copies.

MARIAN: Great.

But why two?

For each other.

Ladies, your visitor is here.

Can we get our car?

You know, hers and hers.

Aunt Ellis.

Oh, hello, darling.

- She's your aunt?

- Uh-huh.

Uncle John met her in church.

Watch what you say.

She's very religious.

So good to see you.

This is my friend Jamie.

Oh, how are you, young lady?

This your first time

in Tallahassee?

Yes, ma'am,

and what a beautiful city.

- Not like Miami.

- Oh, no, no.

Not like Miami.

You able to stay with us long?

No, unfortunately...

Right after birding,

we're off to Massachusetts.

- We just decided last night.

- Jamie.

Well, what do they have

in Massachusetts

that we don't have right here

in North Florida?

Women can get married there.

To each other?

Hmm.

Well, that's an innovation.

("Cryin' My Eyes Out (Lyin'

Beside You)" by Shannon Shaw)

(engine starts)

- Ladies!

- (song stops)

(song resumes)

Here I am

Lying beside you

Feeling your heart

beat in time

Same as mine

Here I am

Since I'm beside you

And I'm your wife

and you're mine

Everything's fine, fine

You were the second thing

that I

I ever knew

Didn't think there was

anything on this earth

That you couldn't do

Here I am

Lying beside you

Feeling your heart

beat in time

Same as mine

Here I am

Since I'm beside you

And I'm your wife

and you're mine

Everything's fine, fine

Hands still strong

and fingers straight

Where have you been,

for goodness' sake?

What do you feel

from this point, huh?

What will it take?

You were the second thing

That I ever knew

Didn't think there was

anything on this earth

You couldn't do



Here I am

Lying beside you

Feeling your heart

beat in time

Same as mine

Here I am

Since I'm beside you

And I'm your wife

and you're mine

Everything's fine, fine.

Well...

("Got My Mojo Working" by

Joyce Harris & The Daylighters)

I got my mojo working,

but it-it won't work on you

Yeah, I got my mojo working

It just won't work on you

Well, I'm going

to love you so

Till I don't know what to do

I got my four-leaf clover

all a-hangin' high

Got my black cat bones

all clear and dry

Got my mojo working

It won't work on you

Yeah, I'm going

to love you so

Till I don't know what to do

I got my hoodoo ashes

all around your place

Got my black cat boots

underneath your bed

Got my mojo working

It won't work on you

Yeah, I'm going

to love you so

Till I don't know what to do

I got my mojo working

Oh, let me hear it

Got my mojo working

Come on by, now

I got my mojo working

Like, I mean,

you know, turn me off

- I got my mojo working

- Yeah

I got my mojo working

Yeah, I know you have

I got my mojo working

Yeah, I got my mojo working

But it just won't

work on you

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

I got my mojo working

It won't work on you

Yeah, I'm going

to love you so

Till I don't know what to do

Yeah, I got a Gypsy woman

giving me advice

Red-hot tip

gonna keep on ice

I got my mojo working

It won't work on you

Yeah, I'm going

to love you so

Till I don't know

what to do.
