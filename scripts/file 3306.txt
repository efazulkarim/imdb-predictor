Good morning, sunshine.

How'd you sleep?

KIT: Good.

Good? You brush your teeth?

For a full minute

Okay. Yeah, we're getting there.

What'd you dream about?

I dreamed about Mom

giving me lots of kisses.

I really miss Mom.

Look, she's always gonna

be looking after us, Kit.

You know that, right?

Kaya, why can't I

come with you today?

Because you're gonna be helping

Dad fixing the boat, okay?

Okay. Not fair.

I know.

I'll take you next time, okay?

I won't be gone long, I promise.

Hey. I'm meeting Tessa.

So, um, I made you breakfast.

There's eggs and toast

in the kitchen.

Nice, thanks.

Yeah.

Thanks, kiddo.

I, uh, thought

I'd patch up the boat

and take her out again.

Hey, you and, uh...

No. No.

You and Tessa treat yourselves.

Seriously. That's--

That's fine. It's okay.

I'm gonna go.

Uh, I'll see you later.

Just don't forget

Kit's insulin, okay?

I got it.

Yeah, all right. Bye.

Wait until

you see his friend.

Okay, I don't

need a fix-up, Tess.

I know. I'm just saying.

How'd you even meet these guys?

Um, from Lance's beach party.

They're like water-stunt junkies

or something, I don't know.

They film these insane videos,

but they're really cute.

They're cute, but super crazy.

Want?

No.

What? Can you please

keep an open mind?

Give them the chance.

It'll be fun, I promise.

Happy to be your wing girl.

Okay. Let's do this.

Why don't you hold this on it,

and it's gonna feel better

Yeah.

Okay.

Hi. Mm...

Mm.

This is my best friend, Kaya.

Kaya. Julian.

Nice to finally meet you.

I've heard so much about you.

Mostly good stuff.

Oh, great.

No, I'm just kidding.

Mostly bad stuff.

This is my best bro, Xander.

Hello.

Hi.

JULIAN:

You ladies ready

for the islands?

We should be off

in half an hour?

Islands?

Yeah, the Bahamas.

Bahamas?

Well, don't try

to act too scared.

Xander and I have made

the trip a million times.

It sounds scarier than it is.

I just can't be out long.

I have to take care

of my little brother.

We'll be back before sunset.

Yeah, come on, Kaya. Please?

Be spontaneous.

Please, Kaya?

JULIAN:

You're going jet-skiing?

Yeah, for a little while.

I wanna go on a jet ski,

Kaya, please!

Hey, buddy! I promise

I'll take you next time.

Can I be the driver?

Oh, of course!

I bet you're a better driver

than your sister.

Okay.

I miss you.

Okay, so I'm gonna be home late.

Dinner's in the fridge, okay?

I love you.

I love you too.

Bye.

Where the hell is your dad?

Probably halfway

through his first six-pack.

No. No, not today.

I promise you, his world is

not gonna stop without you.

Hey, look at me.

You need this.

Did you know about the islands?

You know, I thought I...

Okay, well, would you

have come if told you?

Probably not.

Yeah, exactly.

You are way too young

to be this old, Kaya.

Here.

You are so cheesy.

I know.

[BOTH GIGGLE]

Is this your way of apologizing?

Not exactly.

It's actually me saying

you need to stop

being so antisocial.

Oh, I see. Okay.

I love it.

I'm excited. Are you excited?

Yes.

Great.

Hey, cutie. How you doing?

Hey.

Are we almost ready to go?

Yeah.

Hey.

Hey. Thank you.

You ever been out there?

Uh, yeah.

I used to go sailing with

my family when I was younger,

but I haven't been

to the other side.

Is it really worth the trip?

[JET SKI MOTOR STARTS]

Epic beaches, caves,

crystal-clear lagoons,

wild pigs.

Pigs?

Legend goes, pirates hiding out

on the islands left them behind.

They've been out there

ever since.

You can swim with them.

Pigs can swim?

They're actually

pretty good. Phone?

KAYA: What?

XANDER: Cell phone.

Oh. Oh.

Unless you don't mind it resting

on the bottom of the ocean.

Got it. Here you go.

You nervous?

It's not my first rodeo,

Xander.

What's up, everybody?

King Julian on the mic,

piped up and ready

to jet over to the islands

with my dawg Xander!

Remember kids, Xander and I

are professionals, so please,

do not try this at home.

the islands of the Bahamas,

let's get it!

Only this time

Only this time

I won't go back

Won't go back

Won't go back

You and I are wasted now

I love you now...

This is incredible! Wow!

Xander, step on it, man!

You better not stay

Kaya! I think

Xander's feeling you.

yourself a man, Kaya.

[TESSA LAUGHS]

You ever been to Mexico?

No, I haven't.

Let's go.

Okay.

Tulum's got this unreal left

I've been wanting to surf,

and you and I can check out some

Mayan ruins and those caves.

Okay, no, my dad

will actually k*ll me.

I'm a hell of a schmoozer.

Oh, okay.

You think you can schmooze

a former Marine?

Yeah.

No, even my mom

is terrified of him.

What?

You're just so damn delicious.

Come here.

[CHIRPS]

XANDER: I love coming out here.

I could live here.

Why don't you?

I want to travel.

I want to sail

to every continent

and see every country.

On a sailboat?

Yeah, a sailboat.

Something about getting

from point A to B

becomes like a mental puzzle.

I have to know

where the wind is best.

Breeze fills the sailboat

with life.

Carried by a force

we cannot see, but feel.

It's like riding a magic beast.

Boyfriend?

No. Uh, Tessa.

How long have

you known each other?

We grew up together.

We're like sisters.

You know, she can

be a lot sometimes,

but she's good people.

We actually got into

the same college, so...

Yeah, she's into marine science.

She wants to rescue

manatees for a living.

I got accepted for

a swim scholarship, but...

I don't know.

Why not?

My little brother and I,

we live with our dad.

My mom just passed away

like a year ago.

And my dad's just kind of

in his own little world.

Sorry to hear that.

It's cool.

Anyways, you know,

just, like, juggling work

and taking care

of my little brother and my dad,

adding college to that

just seems impossible right now.

You seem like a

really good big sister.

Is there a GPS onboard?

There isn't a key.

To activate the beacon,

you must submerge it in water,

or you can do it manually.

Uh, manually.

Remove the safety pin,

unbutton the strap,

and remove the device

from the bracket.

[SUNDAY NIGHT SYNDROME'S

"ELUSION" PLAYING]

Clean all the white shades

In my brain

Before they make me blind

I try to track

The fear inside

I hear that sound

I hear that sound

Stay behind

I know I will stay

Behind

I'll never see why

Never see why

I abide by the sword

That's above

I'd better see how

Better see how

I could vanish and drain

All the lies away

Explain the battle

In my mind

The endless dilemma

This cell became

My comfort zone

I hear that sound

I hear that sound

Stay behind

I know I will stay

Behind

I'll never see why

Never see why

I abide by the sword

That's above

I'd better see how

Better see how

I could vanish and drain

All the lies away

I'll never see why

I'll never see why

I'll never see why

I should vanish and drain

All the lies

I'll never see why

Never see why

I'll never see why

I'll never see why

I'll never see why

I'll never see why
