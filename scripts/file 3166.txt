Slipping with my ball forward

Smoke weed everyday

First prom with my dudes.

It's hot. I need something to drink.

- Hello.

- Hello.

Making you thirsty?

- Yeah.

- Okay.

- Having fun?

- Yeah, I'm having fun.

- The fields, field of dreams.

- Yup.

And that's home base.

- Did I get that right?

- No, that's the pitcher's...

- That's the pitcher's mound.

- You don't have an idea.

There is home base.

- And that's where you stand?

- Yeah, yeah.

Where all your dreams came true.

Yeah.

Are you sad about graduating?

Not really. Are you?

Chloe and I are gonna come visit you...

obviously.

I'm just glad I have another year here.

I can't imagine leaving this place.

I think if you do it right,

it never really leaves you.

Sorry, I just heard that

and threw up in my own mouth.

I hope you're right.

Hey! Come on. Limo's here.

Let's get some double-doubles.

Okay. Be right there.

Oh, my God,

I got so wasted last night.

So, wait, what happened?

The bouncer wouldn't let you in

with your In-N-Out.

Which was obviously unacceptable.

Right. So, that's when we hoisted

you over the wall of the patio.

And then,

you fall into the cactus.

Oh, dude. They're everywhere.

It's like I was giving blowies

in the desert all night.

Oh, f***. I have work tomorrow.

Yeah, I have a practice exam

in the morning.

All right.

- Bye, ladies.

- Bye.

- I love you.

- Bye.

Bye.

Okay. To the homestead?

Thomas wants us to come

to Top of the World.

- Cool.

- Okay, okay, okay.

Would you rather

lose all the hair on your body

or be a prostitute for a week?

- Prostitute for a week.

- Easily.

You didn't even hear the parameters.

No hair whatsoever,

no eyebrows, no lashes.

Oh, please. Come on.

I pay good money to have hot wax

rip most of that sh*t

out of my body anyway.

Yeah, for real.

But seriously, feel how smooth.

Is it good?

It might be cool

to be all slithery like a dolphin.

I don't think I'd do well as a prostitute.

I'd definitely end up a truck-stop boy.

I'd be an escort, but I'd only take jobs

from Johns who, like,

- wanted to be dominated and stuff.

- Yeah.

You guys have always sucked at this.

Whatever. Your go-to used to be

fart out of your mouth or sweat piss?

Still a valid question.

You lack imagination.

Can't believe school's in your hands now.

It's all downhill.

Every year says that.

And this b*tch will be president

and these things will be extra special.

All right. Come on.

I'm tired as balls. Let's get out of here.

Thomas, I told mom

we'd be home soon.

Xi'an dinner tomorrow night?

- Oh, definitely.

- Okay.

We got to hit all the usual spots

before you go.

Okay. Bye, Thomas.

See you at home.

Don't be too long. Mom's gonna be pissed.

Love you.

Love you, girls.

Today we mark a moment

we will never understand,

that life stops.

A son, a brother,

a friend was taken from us.

I've tried to take comfort in the fact

that we are now

the stewards of his story...

...of his joy,

of his life.

We must hold on to that and to each other.

Oh, my God. Chloe,

we're so sorry. He meant so much to us.

No. Not right now. No.

What other way is there to heal

the pain than to think of him and cry,

and laugh, and be together?

Mint?

I'm gonna chug it.

Oh! My eyes.

Oh sh*t. You guys, we're late for yoga.

Namast-gay.

Oh. I got to meet with Student Council

Noah about prom.

You, you have your college meeting, yeah?

Oh, yeah. I should roll.

- Love you.

- Love you, bye.

Okay. So it's all finished?

- Pretty much.

- Okay. Great.

Are you sure you want to shut down

a full road for a red carpet?

Yes. Big gestures are very important.

Okay. So, what I'm thinking...

Hey, Lil.

Top of the afternoon, Guy.

Aren't you supposed to be

in my class right now?

Aren't you supposed to be

in your class right now?

- This never happened.

- What never happened?

Here you go.

Okay. I'm super excited.

I'm gonna plaster these around.

I'm thinking bathroom stalls.

Because people taking shits

are a very captive audience.

Ooh. Yeah. I like the way you move.

- Yeah. Bye.

- Bye.

- Hey.

- Hey.

How'd it go?

Uh, waitlist. Should find out this week.

She just keeps telling me

to think positive thoughts.

Sometimes I just wanna punch her

in her third eye.

I guess if I don't get in,

Santa Barbara wouldn't be that bad.

No. Hm-mmm.

You're going to NYU

and I'm going to Columbia.

We're gonna be life partners forever.

God, imagine how many times

we've walked these halls and thought

three months, two months, two weeks.

How the f*** did we get here?

"Time has a terrible way of fleeting by."

My mom wrote that to me

in a letter when I was eight.

Okay. I got to dump out.

I can't believe

you like shitting at school.

I'm very comfortable here.

So...

- Yo! What's up?

- Hey.

Just the girl I was looking for.

- Oh, Sam.

- Jared.

Jared. Hey guys, what's up?

So, we got a create-a-party tomorrow

at Carrie's and I need to spread the word.

- Hold on.

- Uh-oh.

I know what this is.

Hi, guys.

Hi. So, it was a really good day

at Path Less Taken, wasn't it?

Yeah, this guy knows

what I'm talking about. Cool.

Okay. So we only have

two weeks left, right?

- We need to cherish...

- And so, at prom, you two going together?

Well, yeah. Mein Fuhrer 's orders.

Yeah, she used to pencil in our playdates.

Prom, May 18th, it's gonna be

the best night of your life.

- But it's a shame though.

- I promise you.

- Buy tickets, please.

- I look fine in a tux.

Please, please.

Also, party at Carrie's tomorrow night.

Yes, thank you.

- Bye.

- Here you go.

Hey.

- Yo.

- Yo.

- Pretty good, huh?

- Mmm, that was nice.

- Bemis alarm. 3:00.

- Oh. Ooh,

Bemis.

Bite my penis.

- Bemis is really hot. 
- I know, right?

I like his wizard glasses.

Yeah, I'd let him Harry Potter this.

You should hide Donkey Bong better.

Come on. We need him around.

His last days of high school, too.

So we'll pick up tree

then meet at my house, yeah?

- For sure.

- Okay. Bye.

Becks.

Beck.

Rebecca, come on.

Becks.

Give it to me now

I wanna li-li-li-lick you

From your head to your toes

And I wanna move from the bed

Down to the down to the to the floor

And I wanna ah-ah

You make it so good

I don't wanna leave

But I got to kn-kn-kn-know

What was your fantasy

I wanna li-li-li-lick you

From your head to your toes

Hello? Yeah, father.

Divorce meeting tomorrow, remember?

Why don't you call her?

Bye.

Are you f...

Hey, don't text and drive.

From Dad, "Your mother is a b*tch."

Is everything okay?

Do you ever feel like your parents only

see you as an extension of their own ego

and have no regard

for your personal happiness

as an autonomous human being?

Yes. And they just don't know how to

support you in the ways that you need,

and that makes you feel alienated,

and then you feel guilty

for feeling alienated,

and then you resent them

for making you feel guilty

for feeling alienated, but the truth is

they just don't have the capacity

to understand or care?

Yeah. Hold on.

What were you and Bemis talking about?

Ugh. So, I gave a great presentation

on Kant today,

and then found this in my locker.

"I KANT stand this KUNT."

That's actually pretty clever.

Well, f*** you, because Bemis

said that my unpacking

of the third formulation was enlightened.

Mmm. Are you sure he wasn't talking

about the unpacking of his cock?

That... Ten and two.

Jesus.

Who goes there? What up?

- What up?

- Okay, okay. I knew it was you.

Thank you for putting up

my draconian security protocol.

How y'all doing? Have a seat.

Uh, I laid out

a little sample sale here.

We got Pluto OG,

aka Neil deGrasse Tyson.

Next up we got one I call Kramer,

because it like pops in.

You know I'm saying?

And then we got Strawberry Cough

and Barack O'bubba Kush,

because I know you're political and sh*t.

- Ha!

- Get some Cough.

That was your bro's favorite, too.

Highs and lows?

I'll go first. Highs,

prom-planning, duh. Uhm, and lows,

hmm, only having two weeks left

of high school with you guys.

That was so sad, it sucks.

Becks' eye-f***ed Bemis

for, like, 30 full seconds.

Oh, yeah, I did, because Amelia,

in yoga, was pose banging Aaron Jakes'

like cat and cow.

How about this? You like that one?

You like this one?

How's my p*ssy looking downward dog?

Oh, look at that.

What's that one?

How's that back arch

for my vagina?

Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Aaron Jakes,

the, the sophomore

who wears that puka shell necklace?

- Have his balls even dropped yet?

- Yes.

Into your mouth?

A couple times. He could be fun for prom.

Have you guys given thought

to going to prom together?

Just girls?

Oh, I want a real prom date,

like with a penis.

I know. There will be plenty of guys

to satisfy us at After Prom.

Okay. Sorry, Slutty B. Anthony.

But this is about more than just

girl power and getting laid.

Ugh, fine, you guys are such girls.

You should invite Bemis to prom.

I might invite him

to the graduation party.

- Ooh.

- Hi, guys.

- Hi, Jill.

- Hi.

Jill, who did you take to prom?

Uhm, I went with, uh, Lily's dad.

So, look how well that turned out.

Just kidding.

- Little girls.

- Love you.

Not so little anymore.

Now they're just a bunch

of washed-up skanks.

- What the f***? Shut up.

- Whoa.

- Excuse me.

- They washed-up, they swag.

- They all washed-up.

- F*** you.

- It's over.

- Crap, I got to pick up your sister.

I need some perfume. You got any?

Mom, she, she knows that you smoke.

When you have kids,

you will know how important it is

to keep up appearances for your children,

and then slowly reveal all your flaws

when they're old enough to handle them.

Okay, bye.

- I love you girls so much.

- Love you.

Love you.

I can't wait to be a mother.

- Go away. Get out of here.

- So weird. Go away.

- How's everybody doing?

- Excited.

- Yeah?

- Yeah. Uhm,

Chloe hasn't heard from NYU yet,

so that's a bummer.

Yeah, but I mean, wasn't she feeling

really good about UCSB?

No. Us, going to school together,

near each other, that is part of the plan.

Okay, my little cruise director.

- It is.

- Okay.

- Sorry.

- Okay. Okay.

- What's this? What are you writing?

- Oh. No, that's, uh...

it's for Clo.

Tomorrow's Thomas' 19th birthday.

So, I just had some nice things planned.

Do you wanna talk about it?

I'm fine.

It's gonna be a tough day, for everybody.

You know,

he would have hated this shrine.

"Don't be such a sad sack, mom. Turn it

into a pool room or a sex dungeon."

Hmm.

It's not

how it's supposed to be.

I know.

But it's how it is, mom.

We, we could do something later, maybe.

Yeah. Yeah.

Top of the morning, Jerry.

You wanted to see me?

So, how you doing?

Great.

A little wound-up lately?

Uh, it's kind of my default.

Okay. So, I wanted to talk to you about

some prom stuff before Student Council.

I wanna talk to you about delegating.

- You suck at it.

- Don't do this to me, Jerry. Don't do it.

You know who...

- And just because it hasn't worked before,

doesn't mean it never will.

People can be there, if you let them. You have to share

this process, you have to share it with Student Council,

especially with Noah, because

it looks like he's gonna be the one

taking over next year.

Okay. A wise man once told me, "The world

begins when I'm born and ends when I die."

And I really feel that that applies

to my tenure here. So, let's just,

you know, let that one marinate

and then we can circle back.

That doesn't make any sense.

My buddy was in jail at San Quentin. He was jonesing for some blow.

Uh, those days I had a pretty good arm. So, I loaded up a tennis ball

with some grade A quality snow,

hurled it over the wall.

It worked out great.

Okay. Let's get started

with those drug presentations.

- PCP?

- I have to go to the bathroom.

- Uhm, can it wait?

- If you want a bloody beanbag.

Menstruation is a miracle. I'm jealous

that I can't experience it myself.

Take your time.

All right. Who's ready? Angel dust?

Hey, Clo, you still at Lil's?

I'm, uh, I'm gonna swing by

and get you girls in 30.

I love you.

I'll call you when I'm outside.

Hey, Clo, you still at Lil's?

I'm, uh, I'm gonna swing by

and get you girls in 30.

I love you.

I'll call you when I'm outside.

Hey, Clo, you still at Lil's?

I'm, uh, I'm gonna swing by

and get you girls in 30.

I love you.

I'll call you when I'm outside.

Clo. Clo.

- Hey.

- Hey. I took the liberty.

- Is class over?

- Yeah.

- Thank you.

- No problem.

It was a hard day.

Here.

To Thomas,

who showed us that

you can be smart,

athletic, kind, and...

f***ing high all at the same time.

- Cheers.

- Cheers.

You want me to get Lil?
No, it's okay. She's off saving the world,

one prom at a time.

Yeah.

Well, you know, uhm, speaking of prom...

Uhm...

I was a little worried that

you might think I was just, like,

f***ing around earlier.

Definitely. I'd really like to go

with you, if you're into it?

I don't know about your face.

I don't know if you would. But...

No, I have this, uhm...

I have this pre-frosh thing

at UCSB this weekend.

-No. That's, that's chill.

- I totally get that.

- No. No. No. No. I'm not saying that.

I don't, I don't know

if I'm gonna go to that or not, uhm,

but if I don't go,

I'd love to go to prom with you.

Well you should then. Cool.

So Jerry will make

an announcement

and then it'll be girls' soccer,

led by yours truly.

Then it'll be boys' soccer,

though I really object to that order,

but then we'll both celebrate

our crushing victories.

Okay. Prom?

I really need your guys' help on this.

So Noah...

will you check the rates

at these catering companies?

Uhm, try Alphonso at Caf Food,

just let me know if you need any help.

You know what, I can actually, I can...

Noah, uh, are there some

agenda issues you'd like to address?

So, there are many things

that are important for prom,

but the most important thing,

is, uh, your date.

Hmm. What's going on?

Lily will you please

Come to prom with me

I think you are very pretty And very sweet

And I have wanted to ask you For like 600 weeks

Sorry if that makes me a creep

I'm so tall and I'm Jewish

And you're Jewish

We're both Jewish

And Jews should stick together

Because there's not that many of us

So let me go to prom with you

Don't say no, don't say no

Don't say no

- Don't say no, don't say no

- Wow, that was great.

That was... doesn't that...

Okay. Email tonight,

meeting adjourned, thank you guys.

Look, I know I'm no Heath Ledger,

but I know you like big gestures so...

Prom is my prom date

and it should be yours too.

I mean, dude, the ukulele...

Seriously? Have some self-respect.

Yeah, but he planned

the whole thing though.

Pretty f***ing cute.

- Hey.

- Hey.

- Hey.

- Guys, I just had a serious CRAFT moment.

What did you play, Light as a feather,

stiff as a board? I love that game.

No. So I was sitting in the library,

and guess who walks in.

- Hey. Rebecca.

- Hey. What's up?

- A little light reading I see?

- Yeah.

My parents never done one,

so I'm just trying to sort through

and this one's my personal reading.

Ah, well, uh,

you know, sometimes

there's just no reason at all

- and there's nothing pure about it.

- Yeah.

Right.

I'll just, uh, you know,

- finish the shift.

- Yeah, nice seeing you.

She rockin she drinkin she turning She rolling she smoking sweating

She's sweating I hold her She about to go and she going shake

She rocking

She rocking only for dollars

For dollars they are from ballers

From ballers think she'll be

Your sexy flawless

Here's 26, 28, 30 inches

You taste it got a lot of ambition

You get a lot of woman bad b*tches

Drop it, drop it, drop it

Girl get it get it

Pop it pop it drop it drop it rub it

Girl get it get it

Girl get it girl get it get it

What's up?

- Hey.

- Hey.

The water hot enough for you?

Have you ever masturbated to completion

next to a total stranger before?

Bemis is hot.

but in my fantasy,

it's Gore Vidal and Trent Reznor.

Is that f***ing crazy?

Wait. So she knew you were masturbating?

She knew who I was fantasizing about.

I masturbate at school all the time,

it's a great burst of energy.

It totally focuses and relaxes you.

I'm never holding your hand again.

Okay. So, if you send a sext

to somebody and they text you back,

"O period K period", what do you reply?

Aaron Jakes is a douche.

Have you seen him again?

Just a few times,

late night at his house,

younger boy throwdown,

they do what you say.

Hm. Unless they turn you down.

Anyway, indifference

is the greatest aphrodisiac.

Yup, because Iceberg Slim said,

"You can't need the p*ssy."

And who is Iceberg Slim?

A great writer and renowned pimp.

- How did the meeting go, Meils?

- Dude, divorce stuff sucks.

My dad refuses to give Rosa benefits,

but then I see him and he gives me this.

That's f***ing suck.

It's just such a f***ing letdown,

you know.

And this bracelet's

like really f***ing tacky.

- You should tell him it upsets you.

- No, you can't. He's a dick.

You might as well enjoy the perks.

I f***ed up my eyeliner.

- This corner.

- Yeah.

Okay. So...

I have a little something.

It's Thomas' favorite.

Oh.

Happy birthday dear Thomas

Happy birthday to you

Okay. To Thomas. All right.

Here we go, all right.

That was the one, good cake.

Very good cake.

Taxi's here bellas.

All right ladies, let's throw on

some slutty dresses and get f***ed up.

- Is that what you're wearing?

- Yeah, I'm over it.

Give me my shot, give me my shot

Give me my shot, keep calm

Give me my shot, give me my shot

Give me my shot, keep calm

Give me my shot, give me my shot

Give me my shot, keep calm

All right. Let's get schwatsy faced,

zanzi-bars? Shrooms?

I don't care, whatever, I'll get weird.

I'm gonna grab that blunt

from the Travises. Travis!

Oh.

Okay. I'm, I'll go to the bathroom.

A lot of Wagner biographies.

You go to Catcher High?

That's a bummer.

Uh-hmm. You a Path girl?

Hmm.

Enjoy yourself.

Yeah, you too.

Psst. Madame President?

What the f***?

Were you waiting out here

for me with a joint?

I was. Uh, it's an apology joint.

No. I should apologize.

You were really sweet. I was...

I was a really big b*tch, I'm sorry.

No. You weren't a b*tch, you weren't.

I, it's, most guys look so cool to you

and I thought that I would join the ranks

of those great uke players, but, uhm...

I found out

that I'm not one of those guys,

and I feel really bad

that I embarrassed you, I, I didn't...

- I'm just not that kind of girl.

- Yeah.

- Yeah. Uhm, and, and plus,

- Okay.

I already have dates.

I thought prom was your date?

Well, the girls and I

were probably gonna go together.

Yeah, but, I mean, who are they

gonna dance with during slow songs?

You'll be the one running sh*t,

they can't dance with you.

Besides, I thought it might be nice

if you have someone to give you their coat

if you get cold.

F***. I'm a b*tch.

That would be nice. You...

You're so nice, you are. It's just,

I have a lot of things...

I'm not that nice.

Okay. So, let's just hold our horses.

- I'm here with my girls.

- Oh, no. No. No. Don't...

Look, it's dark outside,

you're probably really drunk,

I could be anyone to you.

So, if we're gonna do this,

you need to come over

in the afternoon,

it's much better lighting.

Give me your phone.

You are really f***ing nice. Thank you.

- See you.

- Bye.

Bye. Thank you.

F*** yeah.

Well, this is f***ing cute.

Meanwhile, my chocolate chunk prom date

is over there feeling on some

just-started-birth-control-titties.

F*** Aaron Jakes

and screw that tiny Tinkerbell c*nt.
I mean, what are we gonna do

about tree next year?

That East Coast weed

is some schwag-ass sh*t.

I feel like we're gonna be doing,

like, cool, like, brooding winter drugs,

like, opium,

you know?

Chloe? Earth to Chloe.

What's up?

I, uhm,

I got into NYU this morning.

- You better f***ing stop.

- Oh, my God.

- Dude?

- Really?

- Hm-mmm.

- What? What's wrong?

You love Ol' West City.

I think I wanna go to UCSB,

like, be close to my mom and stuff.

Have you to talked to Lil?

Oh, sorry, excuse me. Hey.

Hey. They attached a trash bag

to a vaporizer, it's f***ing dope, hit it.

Wait, what happened to your lip?

Younger boy throwdown?

You fought a little boy?

Mmm. Yeah.

- What? Did I miss something?

- ...are star people.

Oh, my God, somethings off

in PussTown USA. I'm so sorry.

Uh, ah, Chloe, I know I said get weird

and do shrooms and sh*t,

maybe, maybe you're getting

a little too weird?

There's nothing weird about

just hanging with your prom date.

But hold on,

what about those shrooms, though?

It's disgusting,

there's splash everywhere.

Damn it.

Cops, cops with dogs.

Sh*t. Go. Go.

- Ah. Becks. Where's Becks? Where...

- Find her. Find her, meet me outside, go.

Got a little roof on there. A little roof.

Oh, what the...

Ah! Ah! What the f***! Really?

- Becks.

- Becks? Becks.

- No.

- Cops, cops, cops. Come on.

Guys, I pulled out two tampons.

- Dude, gross.

- I know.

- How long were they in there?

- One was mummified.

- So, they're like all...

- Yeah.

- Like a loom.

- No.

Like Penelope fighting off suitors.

Okay. Come on, we got to go. Come on.

All right.

Party's over, let's go.

Where are you ladies going?

- Uhm...

- Yeah?

Our friend Rebecca here

just had two tampons inside of her,

and it was quite a struggle

to get them out.

Maybe you, you have a, a daughter

and you know how difficult tampons

can be sometimes.

Yeah. She's got a point.

Nora just turned 13.

I spent an hour outside the bathroom

yelling through the door,

"Just shove it up there." Tampons.

All right, ladies, that's it, come on,

party's over. Let's go. Be safe. Come on.

Thank you, officers. Thank you.

- Anyone else?

- Oh, oh, oh.

There is this book,

it's called It's Perfectly Normal,

it talks about everything

from discharge to tampons,

you should really check it out.

Thank you so much.

That's the most times

Ive heard the word tampon ever.

Did she just say discharge?

Hey.

Croissants to soak up the poison

that is rotting in your stomachs.

Oh, Mr. Bemis loves croissants.

I feel like your period

is punctuated by two huge dumps,

- one at the beginning and one at the end.

- Oh, we're synched. Mc-lin-tock.

Yeah, I'm just happy,

I wont have it at prom.

Oh, yeah, which apparently

you are going to with Sam,

- that's a subtle ditch, Judas.

- Oh, your face. I cant. Too hung over.

Where's the tree?

I think were Treeless in Seattle.

- Not even One Tree Hill?

- Nothing.

All Ive got are these weird

weed mint strips.

Those even work?

I don't know, well see.

Either have really fresh breath

or we'll be really high.

Cheers.

- Cheers b*tches.

- Mazel tov.

I Am Legend is how it will happen.

Someone will invent a cure for cancer

and the vaccine will make everyone

a zombie brain-eater.

I Am Legend?

Okay...

Would you rather have penises for fingers

or vaginas for ears?

Hmm, do the penises get hard?

Yes.

Okay. But like can you control them

when they're hard?

The thing with dick fingers,

is that you cannot wear rings,

but if you have vaginal ears,

you can wear earrings.

Like bling?

- Like Vling.

- Vling.

Wait, wait, wait, wait, girl,

listen, listen, listen.

Yeah, what's up? Okay. What if

you have dick fingers and vagina ears?

- Oh.

- Yeah.

Like, oh,

like I've literally f***ed my brains out.

I've got brains coming out of my nose

and jizz all over my head

and I haven't even made dinner yet.

I'm making hamburger helpers.

Eww.

- Liv!

- Liv!

- Oh yeah. Here's my baby sister!

- There she is.

Wait, Liv, youre in sixth grade?

- Yeah?

- Dude,

- my b*obs were so big at sixth grade.

- That is...

Yeah. That is the best f***ing year,

- it's gonna be the best year of your life.

- I hope not.

- I promise.

- I hope you're the best.

I promise.

Oh no. Lil, I think Stella

ate your breath strips.

Oh, Stella.

You guys really like fresh breath.

Stella.

How are you feeling girl?

Trippin' balls...

Huge, sweaty balls...

You're gonna get through this.

I don't know man...

Oh. Her breath smells like someone

hot boxed a toothpaste factory.

Prom tickets, 15 dollars.

Seriously guys, they're 15 bucks.

Okay. After party tickets,

Forty bucks apiece. Leggo.

This is bullshit,

why do they want your tickets?

Look, after Party is more important

than prom, all right?

Prom is just an excuse for girls

to get fancy dresses and fake tans.

And to make memories

in a beautiful atmosphere,

all right, expertly created

- by dedicated Student Council members.

- Hm-mmm.

Look, you care too much. They smell it.

Look, wanting people to be happy

and have a good time, that's a bad thing?

No, it's just letting people

have a good time is better.

Thank you.

Look, you know, its fine

that you asked Chloe to prom,

but you should've talked to me first.

What about bro code?

Im sorry. I didnt want to upset you,

- okay?

- Whatever. It's cool.

I mean, I guess if she's not gonna go

with me, youre the next best thing.

All right. We good?

Yeah, we're cool.

- All right, thank you.

- All right.

Oh, God.

Meils. Meils, are you okay?

I came here to give that

little piece of sh*t a piece of my mind.

Piece of sh*t? Oh.

Aaron Jakes. You know that little

taint-troll? Is he around here?

All right, you know, you take that,

I'm gonna get this one home.

- Please do.

- All right. Let's go.

Oh, sh*t, better grab Liv, come on.

Aaron?

I love him.

Liv...

whats wrong?

I got in trouble, because James

wrote something really gross

in my paper on governments.

- What?

- James,

he must've gone

on the computer when it was up.

What did it say?

In the paragraph on oligarchies it said,

"I like to sneak in

and watch my dad take showers."

Its not funny.

Hes so mean, it really hurts me.

Older brothers are gonna make fun of you.

All right? That's just what they do.

James just sees you as a kid right now,

soon enough you'll be friends.

But seriously, you have to admit.

"I sneak in and watch my dad

take showers", that's funny.

Wait, who told you guys about that?

Okay. That only happened once, okay?

And Liv, it was really scary.

Never do it, okay?

It's like,

it's like an angry sea monster.

Hey, look, look,

I'll talk to James, all right?

- All right.

- Okay. Love you.

- Love you. Bye.

- Bye.

-Bye, Liv.

- Bye.

- Jesus.

Ugh, f***. I want froyo.

Hey, do you think were f***ed up,

because of our f***ed up relationships

with our dads?

Uh, you dont have a relationship

with your dad.
You know what I mean.

Well, yeah, I mean,

everyone's dad fucks them up.

Like, I see my dad and I'm like,

f*** you, f*** you, f*** you, f*** you.

But then, you know, I wanna see him

and I still want him to wanna see me.

Yeah.

I mean, I never felt like I needed mine.

I always have my mom, I have you guys.

Mmm, but either your dad fucks you up,

because he's not there

or your dad fucks you up,

because he's there

and honestly

nobody can live up to that sh*t.

Right.

But I guess, until then,

he's still gonna get laid, right?

Yeah.

Hey, dickwad,

can I talk to you for a second?

Your little essay addition,

you have anything to say about that?

Oh! You're repulsive.

That is disgusting. God, dear God.

Okay.

You know how many peoples' games you just

ruined? Abduls gonna be pissed at me.

Oh, cry me a river, Leroy Jenkins.

Dude, this is serious.

It's a joke.

She's not gonna get in trouble.

No, its not about school, its about her.

Poor thing, she thinks that you hate her.

She needs you. Look,

were the only other people who know

what weve been through, all right? And...

you know, pretty soon, your friends,

they're gonna wanna bang her

and if you're not nicer,

- she, she's probably gonna do it.

- Dude, dont talk about my friends

- f***ing my baby sister.

- Look, you talked about her peep-holeing

her own dad in writing,

in writing to her teacher.

Uh, yeah, but that's funny,

because we don't have a dad.

Seriously?

Noah

Hang? I'm nearby.

- Where are you going?

- Read a book.

And this is

where the magic happens.

This is awesome.

Thanks. How was your day?

Uh, It was, it was good. Uhm, that guy Ken

was a dick in Academic Journal.

Theres this like, this freshman girl...

Oh, my God. This is really out of tune.

It's horrible.

So there's this freshman girl who wears

those kind of like risqu stuff

and he makes these gross comments about it

and she's so f***ing schevvy like...

Young male teachers have a hard time

handling a burgeoning young woman, so...

Yes, well, you are very burgeoning.

Look, I'll talk to him,

if he's got a problem with her,

he should really

have a female counselor speak to her.

I, uhm, I wasn't listening

to anything you just said.

See, you would've missed all this

in the dark, drunken stupor of the party.

- Hey, that just tickles.

- Yeah.

I got it.

Wow.

Can I take these off?

That is so hot that you asked,

yes, please, take them off.

Okay. So, uhm...

I'm gonna get really quiet, but it,

it's not that it doesn't feel good.

It's, it's because that it does

and I just wanna focus on that moaning.

It's too distracting.

11 minutes later...

Keep going. Right there, I'm gonna cum.

Okay, wait.

Are you f***ing kidding me?

F*** me.

Okay.

You're f***ing beautiful.

Okay. Reciprocity.

- What?

- Take these off.

Oh, f***.

Look moi. No hands.

That's awesome.

Oh, f***.

Afternoon Delight is the best.

- Hey.

- You're amazing.

Yeah. Yeah, that was, that was awesome.

I'm gonna... a lot of energy

for the game now. Thanks.

Hey, so, uhm, listen. Would you ever

wanna come over to my house

and, like, have dinner with my parents

and just, like, hang out with my family?

Uhm, yeah, I, I would love to come over

and meet your parents as a mentor,

guidance figure in your life. But, uhm,

I mean, they'll really like me

and you'll like that and that's, that's,

that's just bad news for everyone, so...

Well, well, I mean, I already like you.

Like, I'm not trying to date you.

I, I know that you have to leave soon

and my crazy ex would kill me if...

What, the one from Catcher?

Yeah. Yeah.

They're gonna play her tonight.

You got to watch out. She got wind

of this and she's, she's really pissed.

All right, ladies,

we want a good, clean game.

Tough with these messy skanks.

- Excuse me?

- Call it.

- Heads.

- You would.

- What does that even mean?

- Heads it is.

Run that sh*t.

Independent women.

- You know, he was at my place last night.

- Well, that's cool. I'm a sharer.

Stay away from him, cock goblin.

Oh.

Boo!

- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

- What the f***?

Ref, your voicemail box is full,

you missed the ball.

No one's gonna go for that...

Done, b*tch.

Keanu Reeves's mother

is actually Asian.

So, that's why The Matrix is pretty

cool.

Because, uh, some say it's based on

Baudrillard's Simulacra and Simulation,

but he refuted the comparison.

It's not even a thing.

I can't believe

what a raging b*tch Noah's ex is.

Guys like crazy girls.

Yeah, I'm not getting involved

with that sh*t.

I am not playing The Boy is Mine

my last week of senior year.

Yo. You two right here?

You two were too f***ing amazing tonight.

You know that?

Yeah. You know that moment

when you just know

you're not gonna be

a professional athlete?

- Hm-mmm.

- I kind of have one tonight.

Mmm, well, that moment that you had,

comes a little later for black folk.

Yes, but I get you though. I do.

So, uhm, celebratory roll

- for your victory, though?

- Ooh.

- Where did you get this?

- You don't need to know.

Okay, guys, seriously,

just, like, drink lots of water.

- Stay hydrated, please.

I think I'm gonna go.

Oh, you're getting into NYU.

I don't even know if

that's a hundred percent what I wanna do.

What?

I don't know. Maybe this could be

like a good thing for us, have some space.

What's up? Excuse us.

This table is like, you know,

it's not tight, you know.

It's, it's, like, too confined.

You know, it's too tight.

I don't know what I'm f***ing saying.

Let's dance. Let's do that.

Dude, I love you, okay?

She's beyond high school.

She's beyond prom. She's beyond you.

No, no, no.

You have to tell her how you feel.

- Just...

- That was like beautiful.

What? Sh*t. F***.

I didn't see you there.

Are you okay?

I peed myself.

And it was like how warm, you know.

And now, now I'm right here.

Lookin' kind of lonely

I'm feelin' horny put the dick

Are you okay?

I feel like my heart's gonna explode.

Uhm, what hurts you?

I got pain in my chest,

a raging fire in my stomach,

and a desire to kill someone

and die at the same time.

Are you allergic to gluten?

Hi, I, uh, I'm Mike.

- Yeah.

- We met at the...

Yeah, yeah, I remember. Uhm, Lily. Sorry.

Uhm, whatever it is you're mad about,

I'm sure it's not that bad.

Or maybe it is. Okay.

Fine motherf***er

Won't you back that azz up

Call me Big Daddy

When you back that azz up

Hey, do you wanna go out somewhere,

like, it's a little bit quieter?

Would you go upstairs with me?

Can we go upstairs?

- Absolutely.

- Great.

Man, you are sexy. F***.

Uhm...

Those are for a balloon party.

We're not, we're not having sex.

Uh-huh. Yeah.

Oh, my God, you're so wet.

- Oh!

- Whoa, dude...

Okay, that was really...

that was really tricky.

- Mike, stop. Mike, stop.

- Hold on.

- Hold on, I'm gonna come. I'm gonna come.

- Mike. Get off. Get off.

Can I have my underwear, please?

- No.

- You look really bad, Lil.

Have you seen Chloe

or Amelia or Becks anywhere?

I'm pretty sure they all left.

I saw them walking outside.

- They left?

- Yeah. Sorry.

I'm headed to Moreno Street.

Oh! My face hurts.

Morning sluts.

Hey, are you okay?

Oh, sorry about the leaving confusion.

We couldn't find you for hours and then

Alicia the C*nt said you'd already left.

Yeah, what the f*** happened?

We couldn't find you. Your phone was off.

We were in the tree house.

Yeah, what happened to you?

Last night was really f***ed up.

- Yeah, we're pretty f***ed up, right?

- No, you guys were f***ed up to me.

Guess you wanted

to get it in with Sam now,

since you can't at prom, huh?

- Why are you acting like this?

- I'm just trying to be honest.

Chloe is not going to prom.

Chloe is going to orientation at UCSB.

You guys knew?

I had a feeling.

I hadn't heard from NYU,

UCSB was sounding like the smart option,

Lil. Maybe the thing that I wanna do.

Oh, you hadn't heard?

And, and now you know, right?

And you didn't tell me?

I didn't wanna say anything

before prom and ruin anything.

Ruin anything?

What about our f***ing lives, Clo?

- Calm down, Lily. This is good for us.

- Yeah. Yeah. This is great.

Let's all just be alone,

that's a great way to go through life.

You know what?

Last night was a little preview.

You are f***ed up and you're confused

and you're feeling all sorts

of new emotions and then all of a sudden,

you're in a dark room

with some sweaty guy on top of you,

- but none of your friends will care,

- What?

because none of your friends

are gonna be there

and you're gonna be

absolutely f***ing on your own.

- What happened to you last night?

- What happened?

Nothing. A guy was...

was goal-oriented,

it was shitty. I'm fine,

but you guys ditched me

and that is not fine.

Lily, you went off

with some dude and didn't tell us?

- That's not our fault, Lil. We're...

- That's easy for you to say,

you're turning your back on us.

What are you, you think

you're gonna find some new best friends?

What? I owe you,

so I can't make any new friends?

All, I'm just saying, like,

how could you be friends

with someone who didn't know Thomas?

Are you f***ing serious?

I can't be friends with anyone

who didn't know my dead brother?

Jesus f***ing Christ, Lily.

He didn't die

so we could be best friends forever.

We can still all be best friends.

- Yeah.

- No. No, because she is f***ing up

the friend ecosystem.

Like, I'm the glue here, but without Clo,

your boy crazy ass

is gonna be with some dude.

Your f***in' head

is gonna be in the clouds.

Yeah, my head's in the clouds,

because Im, like, worrying about

paying for loans and school and sh*t

that's never even entered your mind.

Yeah, and I'm boy crazy?

Guys drive you f***ing nuts, dude.

Look, you don't deal. Your dad is gone.

The guy that you were in love with, died.

- I'm sorry for the truth bomb.

- You know what?

Lil, I'm just thinking about it.

Every guy you've loved, has left.

Okay, f***! F***. I'm not trying

to psychoanalyze myself right now.

- I'm outta here.

- This is your house.

Yeah, make yourself at f***ing home.

This is an awkward moment,

but I feel like, uh, I have a coffee date,

potential roommate situation.

Could you drive me?

- I got you.

- Okay.

Okay. She's gonna go. That was f***ed up.

Come on. Let's go.

Hey. Lil.

What the f*** is going on with you?

I can't believe

you don't wanna go to school with me.

and I seriously cannot believe

that you lied to me about it.

This is f***ing bullshit. You are

too smart to be acting this pathetic.

You clearly don't understand at all

- where I'm coming from.

- No, clearly you don't understand.

All your cherishing every moment and prom

and your weird f***ing memorials.

Since Thomas died, you've gone

into overdrive. It's f***ing oppressive.

Yeah, this terrible thing happened

and I'm just trying to get us through it.

I'm trying to make it better.

Yeah, this terrible thing happened,

but it doesn't mean everything else

has to be peachy f***ing keen, Lily.

Meils' parents still suck,

Becks still has to worry about money,

your dad is still gone,

I still have to deal with the gaping

f***ing hole that's left in my family.

- Life is hard and it keeps being hard.

- Clo, I know that.

This has been really tough for me, too.

- Oh, my God.

- And every time I try to talk to you

- about it...

- Okay, but we are different, Lil.

- Our sh*t is different.

- Yeah. I miss him, too.

Okay. Well, you know what?

Sometimes you don't get to tell me that.

Youre right, I, I'm not blood,

but he was something else for me.

Dude, whatever you thought he was,

- he was actually my brother.

- Dude, I know.

And I, I, was, I was trying

to make this time special.

All right? I was trying to make our future special,

because, Clo, I don't know what I would do if I lost you.

Stop. Stop.

Oh, my God, I can't...

with this psycho girlfriend act.

This isn't you and I know it.

I'm okay alone

It makes my soul stir

Under microscopes

Oh. How adorable.

You know, college is gonna be

so great. We don't need any friends.

Yeah. We can totally reinvent ourselves

as sloppy skanks who don't need anyone

and gain 15 pounds.

God, sh*t buckets.

F***.

- Hello.

- What's going on back there?

- I'm sorry, I, I was...

- Texting?

- Thinking?

- Well...

you can't just stay still,

you have to keep moving.

- I know.

- And other people have places

- to go, too, so you can't stop them.

- No, I, I know that.

There is a whole life happening

all around you and you can't control it

just by stopping whenever you please

and decide everybody else

just have to fall into place.

I get it, f***!

Have you been smoking?

No.

Then what's that bong in the backseat? Oh, that donk... That's funny. That's a, a sculpture that I, I

made in school. It is. I, we're, I, I'm Student Body President.

I'm a good kid. I am. I just,

I have a lot on my plate right now.

I'm so stressed out.

I, I, I'm graduating.

- Right now...

- Are you going to college?

Yeah, Columbia.

- It's a university.

- Oh, it is? It's not just a country?

Now, I wonder if the people at Columbia

would be excited to find out

that one of their future students

- was arrested for possession.

- What?

I don't know

what the f*** you're thinking

driving around with a bong

in the backseat of your car.

Who do you think you are, Willie Nelson?

Now, even he got arrested.

You're arresting me?

All right. Look, I'm not,

I'm not gonna ruin your life forever.

Oh, thank God. Thank you.

But I am gonna f*** it up

for about a week.

God,

you could be in jail right now.

I can't believe

you would do something so stupid!

Mom, I'm a really safe driver.

I was just distracted.

Yeah, but...

Lil...

- Smash it.

- No.

- Yes.

- Mom.

This is Donkey Bong.

All right? He has been with us

through all of high school.

Thomas smoked out of this.

Smash it.

I wasn't even smoking. I was sad driving!

What's sad driving?

Rebecca was,

she was sitting with her new roommate.

Chloe's not going to NYU.

She f***ing hates me

and she's, she's ditching prom

for the orientation of her new life.

Okay. So, be happy for her,

you should be supportive of her choices.

But her choices, they're wrong.

Shes making a huge mistake.

She is ruining our lives.

Lily, she wants a change.

It's not some affront

to what you guys share together.

- Yes, it is. That's exactly what it is.

- No...

No wonder she wants to get away from you.

- Mom, why are you yelling at me

- Because

- about this?

- You're being a monster.

You think you know everything?

You don't know sh*t.

Now learn your lesson

and smash your bong!

Really good parenting, mom.

Well, f***.

F***.

F***. F***.

F***.

Hey, this is Chloe.

Leave a message.

Hey, guys, it's Meils.

Uhm, I don't check my messages. So...

see you when I see you, motherf***er.

Hi, it's Rebecca. I'm not here

right now, so leave a message. Bye.

Bergbaum-Goldwyn Residence One.

Hi Rosa, uhm, is Chloe over there?

Chloe, Beck, Melia. Where are you?

You need any help, Madame President?

Stop.

I, uh, I couldn't find you

at the party the other night.

- I wanted to congratulate you...

- It's a little vicious, huh?

- What?

- You and Jessica are still involved.

- Don't you think that's a little hurtful?

- Jessica and I have a bond,

but her being completely insane keeps us

from ever being in a relationship.

We're not together.

I like spending time with you.

I care about you.

Yeah, well, I don't wanna be that girl.

Yeah, you made that pretty clear

when you blew-and-dashed the other day.

- You couldn't turn me down fast enough.

- Yeah, clearly,

because you were shoving your tongue

down your ex's throat a few hours later.

Wait, I wanted to be with you

and now you're jealous?

Oh God. Don't flatter yourself.

You know, for someone who's so nice,

you're actually kind of a b*tch.

- Wow.

- Wow what?

Are you gonna talk to me?

No? Okay, awesome. F*** you.

Whatever.

- Hey.

- Hey.

- What's wrong?

- Everything.

No, it's just prom sh*t. What's up?

Uhm...

It's stupid but, uhm...

What's Chloe's favorite color?

- It's for her corsage.

- She's not going.

Oh. And so she's, uh,

going to the pre-frosh orientation thing.

Yeah, right, of course you knew.

Oh, uh, well, she had mentioned

something about it.

Okay. I got to go get streamers.

It's green, for what it's worth.

Thanks.

- Bye.

- Bye-bye.

What are you doing?

Figuring out what to wear to prom.

Paper bag should do.

Oh, you mean on your body.

Stop.

- Are you on your period?

- Yes.

I think that actual steam

just came out of your ears.

This is pretty.

Dude, no, do not.

You're gonna stretch it.

My slender boyish figure

is the stuff that trannies dream of.

Talk.

Mom's pissed at me.

Yeah, but you know she'll deal.

What's really going on?

All the girls hate me.

Which kind of makes sense,

I've pretty much sucked lately.

I mean, you are a freak. But,

uh, I mean, you've always been like that.

You know, I mean,

maybe you've been a bit, uh...

you know, like BFFAEAE this year

with your power p*ssy posse.

But, uh, you know,

I mean, your expiration dating.

You know, I mean, you taught me that.

It's like, uh, you know, like camp dude,

summer was over and he was like, uh,

he was like, "Oh, you're so hot,"

you know, "you give the best handys,

we're gonna AIM all the time

and all that sh*t."

It's like when you know things are ending,

you freak out, and you try to hold on

and then it gets weird waiting it out.

When did you get so wise?

I'm surrounded by brilliant women.

- You got to get a new mindset.

- What? Like an emotional pre-game?

It's like feel shitty or be alone.

You know, I mean, dad left

the night before our Disneyland trip.

You know, we didn't go. I mean,

that sh*t's gonna f*** me up

for the rest of my life, but it's chill.

C.A.R.L. 4ever

C.A.R.L. forever?

- Shut up.

- What are you, a gay trucker?

I'll leave you to wallow now.

- Take it off.

- Nope.

Hi, Robert, it's Jill.

Just calling, 'cause our daughter's

high school graduation is coming up...

Valedictorian.

Speech.

Gonna be a, a big one.

Yeah, could make up

for all the others that you missed,

maybe. Olivia and James are, are well.

They're becoming really...

just wonderful, smart people.

I think you'd really like them.

I do. I think you'd really like them.

Anyway, I'd say talk soon, but I think

we both know that's not gonna happen.

Okay? All right. Graduation, Tuesday.

If you give a sh*t, go f*** yourself.

Okay. Okay, goodbye.

Go f***... Yeah. Go f*** yourself.

What?

It took a lot to introduce myself

I had to put my heart up on the shelf

Glug, glug, glug, in my glass,

then my tummy, and I will pee you out.

That night I got home

I was all alone

Oh, was it love

Or was I fooling myself

And I hope that time

Doesn't pass us by

Or am I fooling myself

Fooling myself

Fooling myself

It took a lot to introduce myself

I had to put my heart up on the shelf

I didn't know that it could be so hard

That night I got home I was all alone

And left to wonder

About the great unknown

Oh was it love

And I hope that time

Doesn't pass us by

Or am I fooling myself

Fooling myself

Fooling myself

And I hope that time

Doesn't pass us by

It was so funny, and then

I don't even know what's going on.

I can't believe

we're at prom though.

Thank God we got invited.

- But I need to be way more drunk.

- Me, too.

Oh. Slow your roll, girls,

the night is long.

Whiskey?

Why not?

- Hi.

- What's up?

You, uh, you look beautiful.

- You look beautiful.

- All right, thank you.

Uhm, look, I just really wanted

to apologize for, for getting all weird 
and walking away from you

the other day in the library.

Loans categorically suck

and I'm still paying mine off.

So, you know, If you ever wanna talk,

I can imagine it's not the kind of thing

that gets,

gets a lot of attention around here.

Yeah, it's not really a big topic of

conversation amongst my friends. You know.

But, uhm, it's very cool

that you are dealing with it now.

- Got to do it, so...

- Yeah.

How's, uh, how's your date?

Uhm, it was just supposed

to be us girls, but things are changing.

Everyone's leaving, it's weird, you know.

Well, what endures

when all else has changed?

- It is love.

- It is love. Kierkegaard.

- Hm-mmm.

- I love that guy.

- Yeah.

- You know, poet.

Well, look, just tell them

your love hasn't changed.

You'll only get so many chances.

- You sad about leaving?

- Not really.

I'm just glad I have another year here.

I can't imagine leaving this place.

What are we doing?

You're leaving in a couple of months.

I, I don't know what Chloe's gonna do.

Hey, Lil, this isn't some fling.

I love you.

Hey.

Hey.

You came back.

Mr. Bemis:
What's a fart that sounds

and smells like nothing? A Sartre

I hate boys.

I know. We're ready for men.

No. You know what I need right now?

I need my dudes, where the f*** is Lily?

I don't know. I wish Clo was here, too.

I miss our token white friends.

I know, it's ironic.

This just...

- Wasn't we had planned?

- Wasn't us.

God, that fuckhead Mike's in there.

They have f***ed me up, just f***ed up.

Lil, whatever happened

with that guy, I just...

I'm really sorry.

I'm sorry.

I think I'm so f***ing well-adjusted.

I'm not, I'm just this,

like, Stepford wife control freak.

I'm crazy.

And I'm so sorry

for being so intense about Thomas.

I just wanted to be sad together.

I get it, sometimes you don't wanna talk,

and he's not my brother,

and just because I was in love with him,

it doesn't mean...

He was in love with you, too, Lil.

I know.

He wrote me a letter about it.

Look, Lil...

It's gonna hurt forever.

It's part of who we are now.

Mourning what was

and what is,

is sad enough, Lil.

I just, I can't take on mourning

something that could have been.

And, you know, whatever it is,

whatever is gonna happen,

we're still gonna be us.

You're my life partner.

I'm sorry about your prom.

No, you are my prom.

Ready?

Oh! Look who decided to show.

- Come on, I couldn't miss prom.

- Hm-mmm.

Guys, I'm really sorry

for being such a psycho.

- It's okay.

- Yeah, it's okay.

You're like

the obsessive boyfriend I never had.

What is never changed

when everything's changed?

It is love.

Oh. I love you.

Now, I don't know what's gonna happen,

but I've got you guys,

- and that is pretty f***ing good.

- Yeah, girl.

- Let's blow this joint.

- Yeah.

- Yes.

- Prom sucks.

- Yeah.

- Let's go.

Yes.

Have you seen the video

that she's talking about?

- No.

- It, it's the best.

- ...your f***ing phone. A**hole.

- Why were you looking at my phone?

You can't look in my phone.

Hey, remember me?

Hey, how's it go...

- Oh!

- Sh*t!

- Go f*** yourself.

- F***, yeah!

That was awesome.

- Yeah. You can't f***ing look...

- F*** you.

- Hey.

- Sh*t, sorry you had to see that.

Everything okay?

Uhm, she's mad that I have a phone...

I guess.

I don't know. She's f***ing crazy, man.

I shouldn't have brought her, that was...

a bad idea.

I have been such a dick to you

and I, I'm really sorry.

I didn't mean to be. And I'm really sorry.

Noah, I've been kind of dick-like, too.

- Dickishness forgiven?

- Yeah.

Great. Come on. Let's go.

- Yay!

- Yo, now the party's here.

Last ones to leave,

classy girls.

Savoring every moment.

All right, ladies.

Let's get the f*** out of here.

Oh, wait, wait, let me get a picture of you. - Oh, seriously?

- Yes.

- Yeah.

- So let's take pictures,

- Jesus Christ.

- Yeah, okay.

Oh, that's good. All right.

Freeze it, hold it.

She smashed brother's Donkey Bong?

Donkey Bong,

there with us through high school,

life, death, SATs, prom,

we only had a little bit of weed, but we

wanted to get, like, really, really high.

We bury you next to your brethren,

Jon Bong Jovi, Sean Bongery,

Bong Connery, "Ceci n'est pas une pipe."

You will be missed.

Oh.

Now, what do we do?

Hmm, I have to finish my grad speech,

but I almost don't give a f***.

What do you have so far?

Mmm, I'm writing that on my phone.

- Well, stand up. Do it for us.

- Yeah.

- Hmm?

- Lily, Lily.

Okay. I've tried to put a name

on what I'm feeling.

It has to do with fear,

of the unknown, of change.

It's wrapped up in memory,

being in the places

that have contained your life.

It has the sense of too-soon nostalgia,

as if I deeply long

for what's right in front of me.

Then a friend said it, loss.

Is that what I'm feeling,

what it means to grow up?

Your growing familiarity

with an acceptance

of the pain of life's losses?

Growing up is understanding

what eases that pain, friendship.

A bond fused by tears, traumas,

hours logged in the same cars,

in front of the same TVs.

All of our memories

are wrapped up in each other.

It's the greatest gift

this place has given us,

and it's part of our loss today.

But the poet, Robert Penn Warren

gave a better definition of loss,

what loss can be if we approach it right.

"The process whereby

the pain of the past in its pastness

may be converted

into the future tense of joy."

Mr. Bemis.

- Hi.

- Hey.

- Okay, uh, call me Immanuel.

- Immanuel? Really?

- Hm-mmm.

- Uhm, thank you for the flowers.

I'm glad you came.

God, what am I gonna do without you?

- You're the reason I come to school.

- Me, too. For you.

Look, I know it's wrong.

I'm 18, though.

Look, I just graduated, so...

I'm, I'm 24, but I have

the emotional maturity of like a 20 or...

- Right. Right. Right.

- maximum.

- Come, come meet my mom.

- Wow, uh...

I'm nervous. All right.

In the middle? Immanuel Bemis.

- Wait, wait, wait.

- I'm gonna get all of us.

- Amelia.

- Rosa.

Your brownies are so delicious,

everybody loves them.

Where did you, where did you get this?

Damn, I love to chill, dude.

- Hi.

- Congratulations.

You killed your speech.

I was crying the whole time.

- Thank you.

- Thanks. Yeah. It was great.

- Are we still on for dinner tomorrow?

- Yeah, motherf***er.

My mom is currently basting

the brisket as we speak, so, yeah.

- Amazing.

- Great.

Lily, I wanna get a family photo.

Okay. Go photo. I'm gonna stay here

and to really eat

- every single one of these brownies. - Okay. - Hey, guys.

- Go. Okay, wait, here she comes.

- All right. Go. Go. Go. Get in there.

- You just literally ruin it.

- Do something.

- Whoa.

- I'm sorry.

- Do something, uhm, adorable.

The monkeys. The monkeys.

- Aw. Do it.

- The monkeys.

Oh, there it is. There it is.

Good one. And we'll do that thing

where you guys hit a hundred times.

- And enough now. Come with me.

- Perfect.

- How are you doing?
- Little bro.

- How do you feel about everything?

- Free. I made it.

- And you're gonna miss the sh*t out of me.

- Do you feel all right about it?

- Yeah.

- I'll be right back.

What?

Rosa may have served the brownies

that I made for our private after party.

- What?

- What?

Just look.

- But how much weed's in them?

- Like an ounce.

- An ounce?

- F***.

- Maybe like four ounces.

- Four ounces?

- I thought we deserve to get high.

- Oh my God.

Your heads are so huge

in a good way.

Okay. Thanks, Rosa.

You know I throw hard in a motherf***er

It's like that go hard up In a motherf***er

And now my tracks getting plate up

In the club that ketamine's lean

But it's better than drugs what

Yo I'm trying to move this brand

Trying to get up

Till it's cracking like Petland

We seen a drought

Now we're wading through the wetlands

I could be the girl chick

I could be the yes man

But I think I catch

A Law and Order marathon

Send a couple texts

Put a motherfucking Snuggie on

I'm sorry, mama

That I am not a doctor

That I rap about the vag

And I smoke marijuana juana

I'm sorry mama that I am not a doctor

But my fortune cookies

Have always read true son

I got a mouth

From the motherfucking west

An involuntary underdog

Motherfucking Mets

And all these sneak b*tches

Hop up on the train

They squirt when I spit

So yeah I make it rain

They scream when I hit

I know exactly what they say

I love Awkwafina

Just like Gucci Gucci Mane

But I think I catch

A Law and Order marathon

Send a couple texts

Put a motherfucking Snuggie on
