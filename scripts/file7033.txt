TOM: Every Sunday, my father had the camera out.

He loved to tape us.

(BARKING PLAYFULLY)

(MOUTHING) Stop.

You've been shooting all day. Do you want to give it a rest?

EFREN: It's Sunday. You know the rules.

You know, he was unconscious immediately. I don't think he suffered that much.

How do you feel about it?

You know, I hadn't seen him in so long.

That made it a little easier.

Dad! Dad! Dad, look at me!

PSYCHIATRIST: Why do you think he stayed away?

You know why.

My mom leaving him. Him running for office.

You know, he was ashamed of me.

It's just, he was a great man, and he expected a lot from his son.

When they told me he k*lled himself...

I think it's 'cause I was getting released.

No, you don't know that.

You know, it's no wonder that he wound up hating me.

You know, one day, you're gonna have to take him off the pedestal, Tom.

You've come far, my friend.

It's clear to me that he loved you, even if he didn't want to face you.

He left you everything, gave you a second chance.

You can start over, live your life, make up for lost time.

Now, just remember, rule your fear.

Don't let it rule you. And when in doubt...

Trust my brain, not my eyes.

There you go.

(INTERCOM BUZZING)

(DOOR UNLOCKS)

I've discharged Mr. Walker. Please release him to his parole officer.

Good luck to you.

(PATIENTS SHOUTING)

(INDISTINCT CHATTER ON PA)

(PATIENTS SCREAMING)

I know it's been 20 years, but you've got to remember your own home.

(DOOR OPENS)

There. Your constant companion for the next 30 days of house arrest.

Impact resistant, waterproof.

It'll warn you if you start to stray. Come on.

TOM: Jeez.

Mmm.

Wait. What does this do?

(WHIRRING)

You've got to be sh1tting me.

Okay, the tour's over 'cause if I find out you have a bowling alley in the basement, I'm gonna shoot you.

I need you to direct your attention towards this marvel of modern technology.

It'll ring once or twice a day.

Could be 9:00 in the morning. Could be midnight.

Pick it up before it rings 10 times.

Stand in front of it, smile, because that camera needs to take your picture.

One more thing.

Fill it.

(SIGHS)

BRODY: (SIGHS) Idiots.

Your parents had no idea what they were getting into.

(URINATING)

I swear, the only way I'm going back down the aisle is in a box.

Aw. Bad luck.

Your father's suicide just days before your release.

(WHISPERS) Shut up.

(GROWLING)

(CONTINUES GROWLING)

Brody?

When my dad died, what did they do with his dog?

He was put down Thursday.

How'd you know he had one? Oh, he always kept a Doberman.

He prided himself on how well they were trained.

One bit me when I was little.

I wasn't supposed to pet him when he was eating.

Never get between a dog and his dinner.

Your father proved that loud and clear.

Wait. What does that mean?

It was days before we found him. It wasn't a pretty sight.

You feeling okay? Where are your pills? (STAMMERS)

Give me these. What is this? Need a little?

Look, that's... That's my problem, okay?

Not yours.

Come here. Come here. Come. Come on. Don't be shy.

You and me, we're gonna be friends.

(SCOFFS)

Look.

For the next 30 days, you're mine.

If you screw up in even the slightest way, you're going straight back to the institute.

A perimeter breach, missed phone call, someone else in the house... Oh...

Any sign that you're losing it, anything, boom.

Because after what you and your brother did, there is nothing I'd like more than to make sure you never get to swim in that pool again.

Okay.

Everyone in life either wears a collar or holds the leash.

Guess where that puts me.

No, I'm never going back to that place. Never.

That's the spirit. I'll be checking in.

Well, when can I expect you?

Whenever I feel like showing up.

Crap, I'm sorry, if I take one step outside the house, this thing will call the cops, so I just...

I just want my groceries.

I can see why, Mr. Badass.

You got five kinds of cereal, four kinds of ice cream, and every snack cake in the Hostess spectrum.

You're off your diet?

Or you're just incredibly high. I can't figure it out.

(NERVOUS CHUCKLE)

I just haven't been able to eat that stuff in a really long time.

What are you listening to?

Uh, that's Lump by the Presidents of the United States of America.

God, it sounds old.

I'm just not really that up on current music.

Yeah, no sh*t. (CHUCKLES)

Uh... Um...

(STAMMERS) I guess this is kind of awkward, but I heard about your dad passing away, and I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

You don't have any family members that could move in and help you out?

Nope.

Well, what about your mom?

I'm not supposed to let anyone in the house.

I'm sorry.

You might as well spill because whatever you don't tell me, Wikipedia will anyway.

Who's Wikipedia?

(LAUGHS)

Look, my mom left my dad when I was 15.

And I never heard from her again.

Why are you asking me all these questions?

Because you're weird and interesting.

And, trust me, nobody's interesting out here.

It's like a cultural wasteland.

Then why don't you just leave?

Well, you know, I'm kind of stuck at the moment, working at the market and... sh*t! The market.

Wait! The... (SIGHS) The groceries. BRB!

(CHUCKLES)

Something tells me you've still got a CD player.

Am I right?

Groceries, CD.

Uh...

"Gray"?

Yeah, I like to label my mixes according to the color I feel.

No, no, go ahead. Laugh. No, no, no.

You didn't do anything wrong. Yeah, go on. Go on. Laugh, rich boy.

No, I'm sorry. No, go ahead, you son of a b*tch.

You drag me out here in the middle of the night and go cold fish on me, and then you have the nerve to pity me?

Why'd you get me out here? Why? Why? Why'd you get me out here?

Are you afraid of the dark, rich boy? No, no.

(TOM GROANING)

No, no, no. I need my pills. I own you, b*tch.

Huh?

You come out when you're done, all right?

Hey, little brother.

No.

No, no, no. This isn't happening.

You're in prison.

They told me you were getting released.

Holy sh*t, look at you, all grown-up.

Well, don't look at me like I'm a stranger.

Well, it has been a long time.

(CHUCKLES)

I knew you had your issues, but it would've been nice if you replied to some of my letters over the years.

Out of sight, out of mind, huh?

How did you get in here?

I came in through the window in the big room there.

You left it open for me.

No. No, no. I didn't leave any window open.

ALEX: I meant unlocked.

Jesus, relax, Tommy.

The window's locked. Well, I locked it behind me, obviously.

You shouldn't just go leaving your windows unlocked, Tommy.

Can't be too careful with all those crazies around.

No, you...

This isn't real.

What?

You're not real.

Is that so?

I'm sorry. You just broke out of prison to come say hi? It's bullshit.

They let you out of the nuthouse a little early, huh?

My pills.

You know that I don't have my medication. You know that.

You know that, Tommy. How would I know that?

What's the difference? I don't want you here.

ALEX: I just got here. Why would I leave? (PHONE RINGING)

What the... Let it ring.

We're having a conversation here.

No, if I don't answer it, it'll call the cops.

Isn't that what you want? No.

It's a violation. They'll send me back to the institute.

I can't go back there. I can't go back. I can't...

Isn't that what we want, what we really want, deep down?

To go back?

(PHONE RINGING)

No.

AUTOMATED VOICE: State your name? Thomas Walker.

No, I didn't...

I didn't do this.

(RUSTLING)

(YELPS)

Oh, Christ!

(PANTING)

Relax, Tommy. You trashed the house.

Well, technically, you trashed the house.

Why would I...

Why...

Why would I trash the house?

You tell me.

(PHONE RINGING)

LYNN: Hello? Tom?

It's Lynn.

Hey, hi. Yeah, it's me.

(STAMMERS) It's my... I'm Tom.

(LAUGHS) Yeah, I figured it would be, seeing as no one else is there.

Did you listen to my gray mix yet?

Uh, no. I mean, I did. It was good.

Um, it was eclectic.

Yeah, I kind of forgot about that last song and sometimes, I start the next mix early, and...

I'm sorry. This one got a little pink at the end.

(LAUGHS)

So I've been thinking about you.

You have?

Mmm-hmm.

Did my homework, too.

I found out some pretty interesting stuff.

(ALEX CLICKS ON SPEAKER)

So I was thinking, I wanna come up and talk...

No, no, no. Uh, no need.

It's, uh, been really busy up here, so you just stay at the market.

The market...

Uh, Lynn, does the Red Pepper Market have a pharmacy?

Uh, yeah. Why? Um...

I'm just... I'm a little low on my meds.

So what the hell do you want me to do? Do you want me to boost drugs?

Well, I mean...

Yeah.

(LYNN SIGHS)

What... What is it you need? Lithitol?

Lynn?

That's serious anti-psychotic sh*t. Yeah.

How do you know that?

Um, look, the pharmacy closes in two minutes, so I'm just gonna slip in there now and see what I could do...

Thank you. But you're gonna owe me quite the explanation.

Thank you.

Who the hell are you, Tom Walker?

Alex?

Alex?

(CREAKING)

Stop playing games.

What the hell is...

(SCREAMS)

sh*t.

(PANTING)

Oh!

(LAUGHS) Skinny-dipping. Nice.

What are you doing here? Really?

Do you mind? Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.

(LAUGHS)

You got a pressurized leak.

What?

How do you know that?

My father's a pool cleaner.

So...

What... What are you doing here?

Your fix. Remember?

Nice place, by the way.

What, is it the maid's year off or something? (CHUCKLES)

Well, thank you so much for bringing these over, but if my parole officer catches me with someone inside the house, I'm screwed.

I just need to make it through these next 30 days.

Wow. You're barely out of the gate.

Can I just have my pills? Maybe we can talk later on the phone.

Oh, crap.

Is this me?

Um...

Yeah.

I've actually been drawing you a lot.

Kind of creepy, huh?

I wouldn't blame you if you just left the pills and, you know, took off.

I love it.

I always wanted a stalker.

(CHUCKLES)

I just never knew I was so beautiful.

You are.

It's Glycamen.

It's pretty much the same thing as Lithitol, so it should do the trick.

Um...

Sorry.

You're just gonna have to explain this to me.

I'd like to hear your side of the story.

I just wanna help you.

Okay, if I tell you,

will you just leave?

Yeah. I mean, if that's what you want.

(PANTING)

Okay. (MOUTHING) Ooh.

Okay.

Uh, when I was 13 years old, I had a real crush on this older girl, uh, Julie Demarco, and when I asked her out, she totally rejected me, uh, in front of the whole school.

And when I told my brother Alex about it, he said that we should teach her a lesson, you know, give her a little scare as payback.

So we hid under this bridge that was on her way home from this Wendy's that she worked at, and when we jumped out, he was right. It scared the sh*t out of her.

Then she started yelling at us and, you know, calling us immature.

Alex didn't like that.

He kind of... He just snapped.

He started wailing on her.

It was brutal.

I told him it was wrong.

But I think he must have known that I wasn't gonna like it because he took out this pair of handcuffs.

He chained me to a metal pipe.

I just had to sit there and watch.

And then he drowned her.

Right in front of me.

I remember, as the life was going out of her, he looked right up at me, and he said, "I'm just doing what you couldn't.

(MOUTHING) "Sometimes, it takes two men

"to make one brother."

Jesus.

And then he made me bury the body with him and said we were in this together. We were partners for life.

I was so messed up after that.

So he did it again with another girl on his own, and this time he got caught.

You know, it all came out.

I was convicted of the first m*rder alongside Alex.

No one believed that I just watched.

He got life in prison, and I got the institute on an insanity verdict.

My mind was ruined.

Okay, well, we had a deal, so...

Thank you so much for the pills.

Have a great life. You don't have to be alone.

Okay, well, actually the court says I do.

I might understand you more than you think.

EFREN: Well, Tom, enjoying the house?

I wish I had the courage to say this to your face.

But, as, uh, you know, I never had the courage to say anything to your face.

Believe me, I'm not proud of this.

I left a lot of things unresolved. (SNIFFLES)

What is this?

Video file recorded five days ago, the night he k*lled himself.

I know you blame yourself for what happened.

This isn't real.

It's as real as I am, brother.

For your mother leaving...

Leaving and not looking back.

Truth is, her leaving had nothing to do with you two boys being locked up.

The real... Real problem developed between the two of us.

Our relationship worked because I always knew what was best...

We... We had rules. (SNIFFLING) Hey, buddy.

Just tell us where it is.

EFREN: But with both of you boys gone...

Where what is?

...her behavior became unpredictable.

She would never talk back like that to me before.

I would've... I would've done anything to keep her from leaving.

(SIGHS)

Look, what I'm... what I'm trying to say is...

It's... (CRYING)

It's not your fault, Tommy.

I don't blame you.

He didn't hate me.

I know... I know it was selfish to stop visiting you, hide you away like you didn't exist.

(CHUCKLES) Oh, my God, it was all in my head.

No sh*t, Tommy. What isn't?

EFREN: I'm sorry.

I'm sorry it happened.

Oh, good. Only Mom hated us. Dad just cared more about his career.

I'm glad he cleared that up. I feel a lot better now.

You don't know that Mom hated us.

She left us, didn't she?

We were just children, and she left us to rot in that jail.

What do you imagine was so important that she never came to see us, never wrote, never called, and just erased all memory of her children?

What do you call that, Tommy?

I call that "hate."

(SCOFFS)


We did a lot of thinking in that cage, about Mom and Dad, each abandoning us in their own way.

We came to one inevitable conclusion, didn't we?

I'm the only one you can count on to be there.

We're in this together, and it's up to us to take what they denied us.

What do you want?

What are you... What are you looking for here?

I'm looking for the same thing you are, little brother.

A chance at peace, Tommy.

Freedom.

Hidden amongst Dad's secrets in this house, there's money, and that money is ours.

Wait. What?

Money? Yeah.

I don't want money.

I don't want any of this.

I'm here because you needed me. Okay?

Trust me, you do need me.

No, I don't need you.

I have my pills now, Alex.

I don't want you here, okay?

The only thing I wanna do is serve my next 30 days, and then, for the first time in my entire life, I'm gonna be free!

(GRUNTS)

(DOOR OPENS)

BRODY: Tom? Where are you?

This is bad.

Are you okay?

You know, I've had better days.

I didn't realize how sick you were.

Listen, I'm not...

(SIGHS)

Listen to me.

I'm gonna go home and get your pills.

Holy sh*t!

(DOOR CLOSES)

Thank you, Lynn.

Goodbye, Alex.

(GROANS)

(GRUNTS)

Oh, God.

(SIGHS)

Alex?

Alex?

His bike.

Yes!

Yes!

Oh, yeah!

(DOORBELL RINGING)

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

(CHUCKLES)

Uh, come in. Come in.

I had to come by after work because I felt really bad after what you told...

No, no, no. You know what?

Don't worry about it.

I'm surprised you're so hospitable all of a sudden because you couldn't have gotten rid of me faster before.

Oh. (CHUCKLES) Um...

That was before my meds kicked in.

I'm feeling much better now. (CHUCKLES)

You were seeing some pretty weird sh*t, huh?

Yeah, you could say that.

Hey, uh...

You want something to drink?

Yeah.

I'll take some of that grape juice straight up.

(BOTH CHUCKLE)

I'm glad my drug trafficking paid off.

Yeah.

It's worse when I'm alone.

Back in the institute, all these people around, I could kind of control it.

But here, by myself, I just... I thought maybe the drugs wouldn't be enough, you know?

Well, you have 27 more days to go?

Yeah.

I think I'll always be haunted, though,

'cause I didn't do anything except watch that day.

What could you have done?

You were 12. You were handcuffed.

I could've ignored his threats and gone to the police after that first m*rder.

If I did that, that other girl might still be alive.

But

I've come to see that there's nothing I can do about that.

I just have to make the best choices I can from here on out.

How the hell are you still such an optimist? (LAUGHS)

I mean, after all the sh*t that you've been through...

I'm not an optimist.

I just don't think I have any other choices.

I mean, what can I do?

Give up?

Sometimes, yeah.

Yeah.

You can be surrounded by people and still feel so alone.

I did everything to try to fit in.

I was nice to them. I smiled at them.

And they just took advantage of that.

The boys at school, they treated me like I was their dog.

I think that the worst part is that I went along with it.

You start to hear that you're worthless so many times,

you start to believe them.

I know what it's like to take medication and not feel normal.

And I know what it's like not to trust yourself with your own life.

(SIGHS) sh*t.

What a pair.

(CHUCKLES)

Can you excuse me for a moment because I'm...

I... I'm like a hot mess right now.

I just need to go to the bathroom.

Wait. Lynn? Yes?

Um...

If I... I mean, if... when I get done with my 30 days, would you... I'd love to.

(CHUCKLES)

(THUNDER BREAKING)

(STAMMERS) What?

It's real.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

Oh, Jesus.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

(GROANS)

What did I do?

Oh, Je...

(STAMMERS) I... I didn't...

f*ck it.

(CREAKING)

No. Oh, Jesus.

TOM: Look, this isn't what... Put her down.

No, no, no. Put her down.

I... (SIGHS) Put her down now.

Okay. Okay.

Put her down. Get away from her.

Why did you do this?

What happened to you?

Why the hell did you do this?

I didn't. I mean...

I... (BREATHING HEAVILY)

Is this because of your brother? What?

Wait. What happened to my brother?

He burned in a prison fire.

Is he dead? Do you know for a fact that he's dead?

(GROANING)

Oh!

I guess that settles it.

I'm real.

You're...

Oh, Alex. Wha...

Alex, what did you do? What you couldn't.

(PHONE RINGING)

Get the phone, Tommy, before it calls the cops.

Get the phone! Now!

AUTOMATED VOICE: State your name. Tom.

(GRUNTING)

I'm as real as you are, brother.

If I'd had it my way, I would have convinced you otherwise.

Where did you go?

For a crazy hermit with no friends, you have a very active social life.

What are you gonna do with that?

We're gonna have some fun.

No, you're not...

There's a tunnel. I... I saw a tunnel next to the pool.

It leads to a bunker or like a vault or something.

Oh, yeah?

All right.

(HANDCUFFS CLICKING)

Don't start without me.

Come on.

What are you doing?

You've got to get out of here right now, okay? You've got to get in your car, and you've got to drive now. Go. Run. Run. (WHIMPERING)

(GROANS)

(SIGHS)

(GRUNTS) (GROANS)

(GROANS)

Why are you still here?

Time to finish this, Tommy.

Well, is the money in the vault?

There's nothing down there that I want.

You saw him. You saw Dad.

Didn't you? You saw Dad down there.

You saw Dad down there, didn't you?

(GRUNTS) (GROANS)

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

(COUGHS)

Remember these?

No. Yeah.

No.

Alex. Alex.

No. No, no, no.

Don't do it, Alex.

Alex, don't...

Alex, don't do it.

Please. Alex. Don't.

You do what you do best, little brother.

Watch.

sh*t.

I need my little peeping Tom, and you need me.

No. No. No.

ALEX: Just like old times.

TOM: No, no, no. Huh?

(PANTING)

Watch this. No.

No! Please.

No. Please, no.

Oh, God.

No.

No.

Please. No. Please, don't. No!

No. I'm not watching another g*dd*mn...

(GRUNTING)

TOM: No. No.

(BOTH GRUNTING)

(COUGHING)

Go to hell.

You wanna see hell, huh?

I'll show you hell.

(GRUNTING)

I'll show you hell.

(GROANS)

Have fun down there, little brother.

(DOOR LOCKING)

(FOOTSTEPS RECEDING)

(GRUNTS)

Oh, God.

Ugh. God. (SNIFFS)

(EXHALES) Oh, God.

(PHONE RINGING)

(RINGING)

He was messed up, wasn't he?

More than either of us could ever be.

I guess you never really know someone until they're dead, and you get to pick over their bones.

This isn't real.

None of this is real.

You're not real, okay? None of this exists.

This is all in my... This is all in my head.

That's priceless.

You spent 20 years wishing your eyes would show you the truth, and when they finally do, all you want is to retreat back into your head.

Ambiguity is bliss, huh, Tommy?

Well, let me cure you of your uncertainty once and for all.

Our father was sick, and he made you what you are, and he made me what I am.

And his blood was poison, and it ruined us both!

And now I'm gonna prove it with your little girlfriend.

No.

(SOBBING)

Look at the... Look at the phone.

Look at my parole phone.

Notice anything?

That's real.

The cops will be here any minute.

Not before I take this out on your girlfriend.

Well, I found the money! Bullshit.

I don't trust you. You don't have time not to.

It's in a safe down here.

Okay, you just let Lynn go, and I promise you that there's a safe, and I swear to God, I'll... I'll tell you the combination.

What about your new best friend down there?

Aren't the two of you getting along?

What?

(CHAINS CLINKING)

One, zero, zero, seven.

(CHAINS RATTLING)

(WOMAN BREATHING HEAVILY)

Move.

TOM: Who are you?

(SHOUTS) Who are you?

Oh, my God.

You never left.

Oh, my God. You never left.

It's me.

It's... It's... It's your Tommy.

It's Tommy.

(CRYING)

Oh, Jesus Christ.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

(SOBBING)

(WHISPERS) Mom.

(SOBBING) Oh, Mom. I'm sorry.

What is that? Wait, wait, wait.

Stay right here. Stay here.

Stay here for one second.

Let me see.

Let me see.

(BOTH SOBBING)

Oh, God.

I'm sorry, Mom.

I'm sorry.

Come on. Here.

I got you.

It's a family reunion.

Hey, Mom.

(GASPING)

(SOBS)

(SHUSHING)

It's okay.

(MOTHER SOBBING)

(SNIFFLING)

It's okay. It's over. Oh!

(SHOUTS) (MOTHER GROANING)

Oh, my God.

TOM: What did you do?

What did you do? The same as always, Tommy.

What you wanted to but couldn't.

You bastard. Open the safe.

No.

What?

(PANTING)

Open the safe now.

(LYNN SOBBING)

Hurry up.

Five.

Four.

Um...

His office. My guess is, it's the number for his office.

Three.

Just... Hurry. Hurry.

Please, please, don't scream. It's okay.

(LYNN SOBBING) Two.

Home phone number.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

One, zero, zero, seven.

October 7th.

October 7th.

Their anniversary. October 7th.

One.

That was close.

I knew it was here. Get back.

I knew it was here.

(GROANS)

(GRUNTING)

(GROANS) (g*nsh*t)

(GROANS) No!

(BOTH GRUNTING)

(g*n CLICKING)

(GRUNTING)

(GLASS CRACKING)

(LYNN SHRIEKS)

(GRUNTING)

ALEX: We're still in this together.

Two men, one brother.

That's one too many for me.

(ANKLE MONITOR BEEPING)

(GASPING)

(MOTHER GRUNTING)

(GASPING)

(MUFFLED SCREAMING)

(BOTH PANTING)

(PRISONER OF LOVE PLAYING)

MAN: (SINGING) Alone, from night to night, you'll find me

Too weak to break the chains that bind me I need no shackles to remind me I'm just a prisoner of love For one command, I stand and wait now From one who's master of my fate now I can't escape for it's too late now I'm just a prisoner of love What's the good of my caring If someone is sharing those arms with me?

(POLICE SIREN BLARING) Although she has another I can't have another For I'm not free

(TIRES SCREECHING)

She's in my dreams, awake or sleeping You Thomas Walker?

Is this your house?

It is now.

My very life is in her keeping I'm just a prisoner of love Ugh, what's the good of my caring If somebody else is sharing those arms with me?

Though you have another I can't have another, 'cause you see, honey...

And could you please turn that thing off?
