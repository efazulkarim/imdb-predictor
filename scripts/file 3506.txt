The winter months 
Were so much fun 
For April's fool 
From snowball fights 
To skating on 
A frozen pool 
[RAIN PATTERING] 
Her nose so cold and wet 
I like to bow...

[SONG CONTINUES PLAYING

[CHEWING LOUDLY] 
Mmm. 
Mmm. 
That looks good. 
It's a hot dog, yeah? 
Yeah. 
[LAUGHING] 
Man, I can't even... 
Can't even see the hot dog 
in that hot dog, right? 
[CHUCKLES] 
[CHEWING LOUDLY] 
[CLEARS THROAT] 
Hey. 
You know what 
you want, hon? 
Um. Almost. 
Uh... 
It's been a while. 
Do you remember me? 
Well, I get a lot of people 
in here, so... 
Right. Right. 
You look a little thinner 
a couple of years ago? 
I kinda remember 
a couple coming in here a lot. That was, um... 
That was my fiance. 
Page 2/41
We used to... 
I don't think 
I've gained weight, though. 
WAITRESS: 
was someone else. 
[LAUGHING] My memory's 
shot to shit, hon. 
[LAUGHING WHEEZILY] 
Has it really been 
that long? 
So are you waiting 
for someone, or...? 
No, it's just me. 
MAN 1 [ON TV]: 
look down, and you realize 
there's no phone 
in your pocket. 
MAN 2 [ON TV]: 
That happens all the time. 
MAN 1: 
that sensation 
actually has a name? 
Scientists call it 
phantom vibration. 
You feel like 
your phone is vibrating, 
but it's actually not. 
It's just your body... 
[ADS POPPING] 
MAN 2: 
know there was a name for that. 
MAN 1: 
is there a name...

[ELEVATOR DINGS,

[ELEVATOR DOORS CLOSE] 
Okay, everybody. Who's ready 
to change their lives today? 
MAN: 
if you're not ready, 
there's the door. 
Go on, you can leave 
if you like. 
Okay. 
Now, you've all heard 
of the lemon-cleanse diet. 
It was designed back 
in the 1980s to help the body 
rid itself 
of negative toxins. 
Those... Those things 
that prevent 
the body 
from doing its job. 
It originated with Ken Roberts and his best-selling book, 
The Purification 
of the Lemon Cleanser. 
MAN: 
on like wildfire in recent years. In fact, some of your favorite celebrities have done it. 
But Mr. Roberts 
felt he could do better. 
Now I want you all 
to close your eyes and relax. 
Think about that pain 
you felt. 
That deep pain 
that prevents you 
from getting ahead in life. 
Page 5/41
WOMAN: 
We need to know that pain. 
MAN: 
Keep thinking. 
WOMAN: 
Keep thinking. 
MAN: 
Keep thinking. 
[BREATHING DEEPLY] 
WOMAN: 
And open. 
[EXHALES HEAVILY] 
Now... 
who wants to share 
their pain first? 
Yes, thank you. 
One sec, here we go. 
WOMAN: 
Oh, uh... 
Mr. Roberts just wants to get 
a good look at you. 
Heh, heh. 
Uh. So, uh, this, uh, 
one time, I... 
Uh, posted on Facebook 
that my friend Darryl 
was a... A dick-licker. 
I guess I kind of feel 
bad about that. 
Is that what 
you're looking for? 
He's actually... 
He's actually not a dick-licker. Okay. Ha, ha. 
What's wrong? 
[WHISPERING] Come 
on, I'm kidding. 
This shit is weird. 
Page 6/41
Folks, it's... 
It's really important that we... We dig deep here. 
You know, 
your personal stories right now are what will help us determine who goes on the retreat. 
Yes, in the back? 
MAN: 
One sec. 
Okay, hi, I'm Maggie. 
Um. Ahem. 
Yeah, I was married 
for 10 years. Um... 
We got hitched 
after high school. 
Uh. Yeah. My... 
My husband wanted kids. 
Ah, I was against it. 
And then one day, 
I came home and, um, 
[CRYING] he blew his... He blew his brains out with a shotgun. And, um... 
MAN: 
Thank you. 
- You can go ahead now, hon. 
- Oh, not now. 
- Go on. Go ahead. 
- I don't... 
Uh... 
I'm-I'm Paul Berger. 
I guess I don't know 
if I have a lot of pain. 
I mean, we all have bad days 
once in a while, right? 
Um, I recently lost my job. 
I was engaged for a long time, that didn't work out. What else? Um, I'm from New Jersey, 
which I know 
what you're all thinking, 
Page 7/41
but New Jersey, it's... 
It's actually a great place. 
Have any of you heard of 
a town called Newfield? 
Well, it's a borough, 
actually. 
It was established 
in 1924. 
PAUL: 
cleansed before? 
Oh, no, 
thank you. 
I like 
my sandwiches. 
[LAUGHING] 
Yeah, I hear you. 
I'm gonna miss 
hot dogs. 
This sounds real interesting, 
though, don't it? 
The idea of getting pure, 
restarting your life? 
- Keep pressure on that. 
- Yeah. 
[EASY-LISTENING MUSIC PLAYING] When will I know 
if they pick me? 
They'll call you 
today.

[DOOR CLOSES] 
[MUFFLED] 
Sorry, I didn't mean... 
[CELL PHONE BUZZES] 
Hi, I'm Paul Berger. 
[MUFFLED] 
Yeah, I know. 
Hey, I just wanted to say that that was really brave of you. 
What was? 
What you just said in... 
[UNMUFFLED] I'm sorry 
about your husband. 
Page 8/41
I-I-I can't believe 
you had to see that. 
That must 
have been terrible. 
Yeah, um... 
I made that up. 
[MUFFLED] 
What? 
[UNMUFFLED] Well, didn't 
you make yours up too? 
I guess the way 
you kept, you know, 
[UNMUFFLED] going on 
and on and on, you... 
Oh, yeah. No. 
[SCOFFING] 
I made mine up too. 
[MUFFLED] 
Oh, I, uh, 
gotta get that. 
[UNMUFFLED] 
Okay, yeah. Sure. 
Hey. 
I... I hope you 
get the call today. 
Maybe I'll see you 
there, huh? 
[MUFFLED] All right, 
I'll see you around.

ROBERTS [ON RECORDING]: 
Hello, this is Ken Roberts. 
Thank you for 
purchasing my book. 
Although it was 
first published in the 1980s, 
you'll find that a lot 
of my current principles 
actually originated 
in this early text. 
So thank you for listening.

Thank you. 
Hey.

PAUL: 
My uncle had a cat, 
used to scratch him

They can get real ornery, huh? You have a cat? 
Yeah, I have a cat. 
I'll show you where 
orientation is on the map. 
Follow me. 
I'll get you guys 
settled in, huh? 
Let me take that 
for you. 
Oh, it's okay. 
I got it. 
- No, please. I insist. 
- I... I got... 
Could you put that

- That's it. 
- You okay? 
Uh-huh. 
[SIGHS] 
Come on, 
you guys. 
So are-are you 
an actress? 
Yeah, I-I used to be. 
[CHUCKLING] 
Yeah. 
Your photo here looks 
like one of those headshots. 
It's an old one. 
[CLEARS THROAT] 
Gotcha. 
Boy, it's been a long time 
since I've seen the water. 
MAN: 
Hey-o. 
What's up, Jersey? 
They picked him 
off that dick-licker story? 
Heh, heh. 
- What's up, man? Hey. 
- Hey. 
So, uh, check this out. 
She really wanted 
to come here, right? 
- And I'm... I'm trying to be a good dude... - Sure. 
[LAUGHING] but what the fuck 
was up with that contract? 
Kind of freaked me 
the fuck out. 
[LAUGHING] Yeah, no, it did 
that to me too, but... 
[WOMAN SCREAMING] 
[CONTINUES SCREAMING] 
Come on, let it out. 
What? 
[YELLING] 
Page 13/41
Let it out, out, out! 
[SCREAMING] 
[ALL SCREAMING] 
It feels good to get 
that out, doesn't it? 
Mmm. Thank you so much. 
And welcome. 
My name is Lily. 
Now, I know you must be 
starving from your trip 
so let's get started 
right away. 
Fredericks is handing each 
of you your own cleansing kit. Each kit contains 
four drinks, 
which you must consume 
by the end of the day. 
Now, each of these drinks 
is specifically 
formulated for each of you, 
so don't drink anyone else's 
by mistake. 
After you've completed 
your four-course cleanse 
you'll find additional 
nutritional supplement 
in your cabinets 
for the rest of your stay. 
No outside food. 
It's prohibited. 
Oh, whoa. 
[COUGHS, SPITS] 
That tastes 
like an asshole. 
What? Baby, I thought 
you said this is about 
being open, 
being honest, right? 
Getting rid of all 
the bad stuff, right? 
Yes, it is, Eric. 
And thank you 
for your candor. 
Page 14/41
But you must know that 
these drinks are very powerful, and while they may seem 
like a bitter pill to swallow, I can assure you that 
I completed the course myself. And the anxiety 
and sadness that I felt 
was replaced by... 
humility, a clear mind 
and an open heart. 
[SLURPING] 
LILY: 
Good. Good, Paul. Good. 
[GROANING] 
[GROANS] 
Fuck. 
Fredericks here has been 
cleansing for some time too. 
We're hoping he completes 
the course with all of you. 
And now, 
without further ado... 
a message 
from Ken Roberts. 
ROBERTS [ON RECORDING]: 
Hello, everyone. 
Congratulations on being 
one of the chosen few 
to take part in this retreat. 
I'd also like 
to say thank you. 
It takes great courage 
to do this. 
[] 
It is not easy 
to put yourself out there. 
To... To risk judgment. 
It's one of the hardest, 
but most important, 
things that we can do. 
We all have our baggage, folks. It's part of being human. 
Page 15/41
And letting it go 
can be scary. 
And confusing. 
And what makes it 
so confusing is that, 
over time, well, we've actually come to depend on it. 
It's become familiar to us. 
Like a best friend 
to get us through the day 
or a stuffed animal that... 
That keeps us cozy at night, 
and we cling to it 
because we don't know 
any better. 
Especially when we're scared. 
Now, the cleansing process 
here won't be easy. 
But we are 
extraordinarily proud 
of the system 
we've created, 
and so excited to take part 
in this next step with you. 
But you'll need to find 
that inner strength. 
It's over to you now. 
I know you all have it, 
and I'm so looking forward 
to meeting you all 
in the next few days. 
Let's get pure.

are weird as hell, huh? 
You sure you did your research on this place? 
Ken Roberts 
has helped a lot of people. 
And... couples. 
Mm-hm. Mm-hm. 
Okay, well, I-I-I still 
don't understand why 
we need help, 
but, uh, okay. 
[BASKET RATTLES] 
[GROANS] 
You finished 
all of yours? 
Yup. 
Here. 
What you do is... 
You ready? 
Grab your nose,

and then take a sip, 
and it should help.

[GIGGLES] 
Okay, so... 
What is this thing? 
What are...? What are we doing? Are we supposed to...? 
We do this, we leave here, 
Page 17/41
and we-we feel different, right? We feel enlightened, 
is that the deal? 
Mm-hm. 
I guess enlightenment 
could be rad.

LILY: 
I know it's exhausting, 
but you should take 
great pride in the fact 
that you've completed 
your cleanse, 
Page 18/41
and that you're moving on 
to the elimination process. 
Right. Q-question. When you say "elimination process," you... 
You mean, like... 
[IMITATES VOMITING] 
Heh, heh, right? 'Cause 
I was doing a lot of that 
last night, and a lot coming out the other end too. 
LILY: 
Yes, Eric. 
That is part of 
the elimination process. 
And, of course, the next stage will be termination, 
and after that, 
you're gonna feel wonderful. 
Well, I already feel 
good as hell, so, heh-heh-heh. 
LILY: 
That's interesting, Eric. 
Most people feel worse 
before they feel better. 
Laurie has been having 
some trouble with her cleanse, but I have faith 
that, in her absence, 
she'll be able 
to focus and complete. 
Yeah. 
No, Laurie'll be good. 
Fredericks? 
And now, 
I'd like you to... 
...stare into 
each other's eyes. 
[] 
[SCOFFS, CHUCKLES] 
LILY: 
It's hard, isn't it? 
Page 19/41
Hard to look into 
somebody else's eyes. 
I want you all to remember 
how hard this is, 
because once you move 
into the termination process, 
once you finish this, 
you'll finally be able to stare into someone's eyes 
in a real, meaningful way. 
And it will be 
a beautiful thing.

Thanks. 
Page 21/41
Yeah. You probably 
shouldn't be exercising 
when you're cleansing. 
You could hurt yourself. 
I read that. 
I read it in Ken's book. 
We're supposed to limit 
physical activity.

I didn't bring this on purpose. I'm not... I'm not cheating. 
[SIGHS] 
My thing loves this stuff. 
[GRUNTING] 
Go on. 
Come on. 
[] 
Hm. 
[GRUNTING] 
It's got teeth. 
Yours has got teeth. 
Yeah, he's teething. 
I guess. 
[BOTH GRUNTING]

Page 25/41
No, what are you doing? 
Paul, I... I don't think 
they should... 
...get that close. 
- [GROWLS] 
- [WHIMPERS] 
PAUL: 
were calling out for each other. [COOING] 
You haven't picked yours up yet, have you? 
It's not that bad, really. 
It's just kind of like... 
...weird butterballs. 
This is so strange. 
PAUL: 
It's not that strange. 
They did come out of us 
after all, right? 
[SIGHS] 
[BANG] 
[SIGHS] 
[CREATURE GRUNTING] 
Hello? 
[] 
Yeah, babe. 
[SIGHS] 
[OBJEC LIGHTLY THUDS] 
[SIGHS] 
Look, hey. Did you 
drink your, uh... 
...your last drink? 
Huh? 
Never mind. 
[WHISPERS] 
Oh, yeah. 
What are you doing? 
I... I was gonna try to finish, but they're too gross. 
I just can't drink them. 
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Can you 
just shut up for a second? 
Page 26/41
Just stop talking, please. 
You're, like, giving me 
a migraine. 
Sorry. 
It's fine. Why 
are you apologizing? 
Sorry. 
[SIGHS] 
You haven't eliminated once on this entire retreat, have you? - Eliminated? 
- I must have... 
I must have 
thrown up and shit 
like 20 times 
up on that mountaintop. 
You wouldn't believe... 
what came out of me. 
Okay. 
It's starting to make 
a lot of sense, 
what they're doing here, 
Laurie. 
Like, I feel... 
[INHALES] 
...different. I feel good. 
Even those drinks 
taste great to me now. 
- Really? 
- Yup. 
You would know 
if you finished your cleanse. 
How can I finish 
if you drank them all? 
You're just jealous. 
Stop being jealous. 
Jealous? 
We came out here 
to fix you, Eric. 
[CREATURE GROWLING] 
What's that noise? 
Shit. 
- Eric? 
- Oh, shit. Hey! 
Page 27/41
- No, no, no. 
- LAURIE: 
ERIC: 
Hey, what are you doing? 
- [CREATURE GROWLING] 
- Please, stop it! 
Get your hand out of... 
No, don't 
do that. Why...? 
Why are you eating 
your hand? Don't... 
Why are you 
eating yourself? 
[CREATURE GROANING] 
[LAUGHING] 
- That's crazy, look. 
- Hm? 
Well, he's... 
...doing that, you know, 
knuckle thing that you do. 
Really? 
[KNUCKLES CRACKING] 
Heh. 
Heh. 
Yours does the thing 
that you do too. 
The weird lip-twitch thing. 
Not weird. 
I didn't... We all have 
our things, right? 
[COOING] 
[GRUNTING] 
So, what do you 
do for fun? 
Really? You wanna... 
...get to know me, 
like... 
...right now? 
Well, I mean, 
they're calm now. 
I mean, yeah. Yeah. 
I figured, you know, 
Page 28/41

we can finally talk. 
Okay. 
The acting thing, 
are you still doing that? 
[SIGHS] 
I'm sorry, I really don't 
wanna talk about that. 
Okay. 
- Yeah. 
- [GRUNTING] 
If you'd like to know 
what I used to do 
for a living, 
I could tell you. 
Well, I worked for this start-up called Buzzy Brain. 
It's... It's a huge 
software company, 
and I was there 
from the beginning, 
ever since It's Monkey Time. 
It's Monkey Time? 
Oh, it was one 
of our first apps. 
If you had a kid, 
you would know it. 
The kids went nuts for it. 
It was a good job. 
It really was. 
And what happened? 
With It's Monkey Time? 
With your job. 
Well... 
That was... It kind of... 
Around the same time 
as the whole... 
fiance-stood-me-up 
at-the-altar incident and... I-- [PAUL'S CREATURE GROANING] 
Let's not talk 
about my old job. 
I know you don't wanna talk 
about it, the acting thing, 
but I think it's great that you Page 29/41

have dreams you wanna pursue. 
No, it's not. 
It's the worst thing 
in the world. 
You just 
end up getting... 
...disappointed. 
[MAGGIE'S CREATURE COOING] 
I wish I was like you. 
I wish I had no dreams at all. I didn't say 
I have no dreams. I... 
I have dreams. 
[PAUL'S CREATURE GROWLING] 
[GROANING LOUDLY] 
Jeez. 
- [GROANING] 
- Hey, hey. 
Chill out, buddy. 
There you go. 
Getting jealous or something? 
- [CHOMP] 
- Aah. 
Are you okay? 
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. 
[MOANING] 
- Are you sure you're okay? 
- Yeah. Uh-huh. 
Fine. 
It just nipped me a little, 
that's all.

[BIRDS CHIRPING] 
[MAGGIE SNORING LIGHTLY] 
[SNIFFS] 
[BOTH COOING] 
Maggie. 
Psst. Maggie. Quit snoring 
and check this out. 
[GROANS] 
Look, they didn't get 
any bigger overnight. 
I found them like this 
when I woke up. 
Page 30/41
Told you they weren't 
gonna hurt each other. 
[KNOCK] 
LILY: 
Amazing, isn't it? 
There are anywhere from... 
50 to 75 trillion blood cells 
in the human body. 
Each cell 
has its own life span. 
Red blood cells last 
for maybe four months. 
White blood cells last for 
approximately a year and a half. [SNIFFS] 
Our bodies 
are constantly changing. 
It's comforting, isn't it? 
To know that nothing's 
permanent? 
Mr. Roberts would like 
to see you now. 
He's here? 
Oh, yes. He'd like to see 
you both. And... 
...you can bring them 
with you. 
He can help you finish. 
[] 
[INDISTINCT CHATTERING] 
ROBERTS: 
And you double-cleansed. 
You drank 
someone else's cleanses. 
It's important to know 
it is a violation. 
It's a simple action. You just gotta follow through. Okay? 
Paul? Maggie? 
So great to finally see you 
in the flesh. 
Eric's just having a little 
Page 31/41
setback here, but... 
Don't let the flames 
put you off. 
Come on. Let me get 
a better look at you. 
[LAUGHS] You're 
better-looking in person. 
Oh. How are you doing? 
I know this can be 
a scary process, 
but all things considered, 
you look like you're doing 
pretty good. How's it going? 
Talk to me. 
What's on your mind? 
Paul? 
Well... 
I really appreciate 
what you're trying to do 
here, Mr. Roberts, but... 
...these things 
that came out of us, 
you didn't 
tell us about that. 
You lied to us. Well, 
you didn't lie, but you... 
didn't tell us 
the whole story here. 
Fantastic. It's unbelievable 
that you could tell me that. 
Maggie, do you mind if I... 
...just had 
a moment with Paul? 
You know, you and I... 
We actually have a lot more 
in common than you think. 
I was laughed out 
of the medical community. 
And it really hurt. 
I mean, it hurt... 
Are you listening to me? 
- Yeah. 
- What'd I just say? 
Well, you said 
Page 32/41
that we're a lot alike. 
Right. 
Because we're human beings 
in a lot of pain. 
I'm really thrilled you're 
becoming more aware of yours. 
And I wanna ask you 
a question. 
I know that 
your ex-fiance hurt you, 
and that's not your fault... 
But is there anything 
you're doing wrong? 
Relationship-wise. 
People sometimes say 
I suffocate them. 
Do you? 
It's okay, we all 
have our stuff. 
Hey, Maggie? 
Come on over here a second. 
I'm gonna do a bit 
more work with Eric. 
Then we'll move on to 
the final stage of our program. You're in a really good place. I'm excited about it. 
Okay? So just 
give me a second. 
What did he say to you? 
Uh... 
- Did he make you cry? 
- No. 
No. 
You look like 
you were crying. 
I wasn't crying. 
[] 
Do we really have to wear 
these blindfolds? 
ROBERTS: 
cookie, aren't you, Maggie? 
We like to think 
Page 33/41
that... 
...if you're trying 
to look inward, 
it just helps to remove 
distractions, 
so we can look into 
our own void and face it. 
Does that make sense? 
Is that 
satisfactory? 
Yes. 
Good. 
Now, normally, I wouldn't 
have you two together 
at this part 
of the process, 
but Paul seems 
a little uncertain 
about my methods, so... 
But I don't think 
you'll have... 
...any more doubts once you see what we're about to do here. 
So, Maggie, tell me. Why...? 
Why did you come 
to this retreat? 
Well, I was married, and... 
I'm just gonna stop you there. I know that that was a story 
that you fabricated 
during the selection process. 
Bu... I'm not angry at you, 
but I just want to encourage you to be honest with yourself. 
You never had a husband, right? 
MAGGIE: 
Yeah. Don't remind me. 
So why are you here? 
I wanted to lose some weight, 
okay? Is that satisfactory? 
- Why'd you say it like that? 
- What? 
"Is that satisfactory?" 
Page 34/41
You're distancing yourself 
from the process with sarcasm. Don't you wanna get better? 
Maggie? I asked you a question. [WHISPERS] 
Don't you wanna get better? 
Yeah. 
Then respect the process, okay? - Okay. 
- Thank you. 
[IN NORMAL VOICE] 
So... 
why are you here? 
I don't like the way I look. 
Sometimes. 
Sometimes? 
I could lose some weight. 
So you lied about having 
a husband, 
and the act of suicide, 
because you wanna 
lose some weight? 
- Yup. 
- But why? 
Because I went on an audition, and the director said 
I wasn't thin enough. 
It couldn't be something 
as superficial 
as appearance 
or going on an audition. 
I hadn't been on one 
in a long time. 
I really wanted the part. 
And he said 
I had a stomach... 
Maggie, there's no more time 
for posturing. 
Stop fucking around! 
Why are you here? 
You know what? Fuck you. 
[SIGHS] 
I've been fucked 
around a lot, okay? 
Page 35/41
I put myself out there 
for so long, 
and I just thought, "Fuck it, 
fuck it, that's it. I... 
I give up." 
[SIGHS] And I'm getting older 
now, and I don't know if... 
...anyone could.... 
Or I would... 
And I've been with 
a lot of guys, okay? 
They all just... 
[CRYING] 
[] 
[MAGGIE'S CREATURE COOING] 
Thank you. 
[GASPING] 
[CONTINUES COOING] 
Okay, Maggie, we're gonna 
finish what we started. 
The cleanse you drank 
has expelled all the negativity from your life, 
and put it into what you 
see before you. 
You've reached the final stage of our program. 
All right, I want you 
to think about 
everything you just told me... ...and pick up that knife... 
...and end it. 
End it now. 
It's the only way 
you can be free. 
I can't. 
I'm s... I'm sorry, I can't. 
It's okay, Paul. 
It's a lot to take in, 
but you have to believe me. 
I'm not the enemy here. 
What are you doing? 
Paul, don't go. 
We can still fix this.

Eric? Laurie? 
Hello? 
You okay? 
[SOBBING] 
Hey, man. What's wrong? 
Paul, will you please 
go away? 
I would just like to stay 
here with her. 
[] 
Is Laurie...? Is she okay? 
She couldn't get it out. 
[CONTINUES SOBBING] 
She just couldn't get it out. 
She didn't finish her cleanse. It fucked up her insides. 
It's all my fault. 
Lily says she's dead. 
Will you please go away? 
Does Ken know about this? 
Paul, just get the fuck 
out of here! 
I wanna stay here with her! 
[KNOCK] 
Hey, look, I was gonna come 
and see you... 
We need to go now. 
Hey, guys! Sorry. Sorry, 
I didn't mean to startle you. 
You, um... 
You probably heard about 
what happened to Laurie, right? Page 37/41

It's important 
that you understand 
that what happened to her... 
...is a result of not 
following instructions. 
You guys have been. You drank 
all your cleanse, eliminated. 
She didn't. 
Anyway, given everything 
that's happened, um... 
we've decided that... 
...the solution... 
...to our current problem 
is that, um... 
Yeah, we need those back. 
- What? 
- ROBERTS: 
Paul, listen. You guys have 
shown so much courage. 
But now I'm giving you 
permission not to finish. 
Just want you 
to trust us. 
Hand over what's in the bag. 
Let us handle it. 
Here, look. 
Take my car. 
Right over there. 
Give me the bag, drive my car 
away. We're finished. 
Scout's honor. 
PAUL: 
you want them back? 
It's a layered thing, really. 
It's complex. 
You're not strong enough 
to finish. 
- Yeah. 
- LILY: 
But they're a part of us. 
- You can't have them. 
Page 38/41
- Paul. 
Fine. 
You wanna know something? 
I got a secret to tell you. 
I didn't even finish 
the cleanse. Me. 
Didn't have the guts. 
Lily had to do it for me. 
She was the only one strong 
enough to finish this program. I guess we're not all 
capable of change. 
We just don't want anyone 
else to get hurt. 
Give us the bag, and we'll 
shut this whole thing down. 
It's over. 
[COMMOTION] 
MAN [MUFFLED]: 
Get off me! 
Paul. Paul. 
It's gonna kill you, Paul.

[MAN MUTTERS]

[ENGINE STARTS] 
[CAR BEEPING] 
Why did they just let us 
go like that? 
What if they're right? 
What if we kill these things 
and it helps? 
I think we should just 
pull over and end this. 
But we don't know, Maggie. 
- Yeah, exactly. 
- It could get worse. 
[] 
[CREATURES GROANING] 
They've been in the bag 
for a while. 
They're probably just, 
you know... 
Page 39/41
getting claustrophobic. 
Hey. 
It's okay. Shh. 
It's okay. 
It's all right.
