- You're gonna burn him. Be careful.

- Shut up.

Oh, my God...

Holy...

You girls are cruel.

Guys, quit. You're going...

seriously, just stop.

You're going to burn...

What was that?!

- Oh!

- Matt, stop.

- Wha...

- Matt, stop the car. You hit something.

- What?

Wait, let me

get my camera.

Something's burning.

The engine's burning.

F***ed up

the front end.

Everyone, chill.

Everyone, chill.

You gonna give the deer

mouth-to-mouth resuscitation?

Hit a f***ing deer

or something.

I mean, you good, man.

The car's still running.

- I'm good?!

- There's nothing leaking...

- 700 bucks! - Look, there's nothing

leaking at the bottom, bro.

You're straight.

It sounded fine.

- We can get there. Let's go.

- I know, but it's just...

That wasn't no deer, bro.

It's here.

- F***, what is that?

- Over there.

Look at the leaves.

Holy sh*t.

Guys, something's moving

out there.

Let's go!

Jesus.

- Okay, okay. We're coming. Chill.

Matt, maybe we

should just go home.

Babe, I've driven,

like, eight hours.

- I'm not just going to turn

around. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Really? Really?

My beard?

- Shut up, Brian.

- You shut up.

You burnt

my f***ing beard.

Yo, did anybody see

what that was?

- Maybe it was a bear.

- Wait, wait, wait.

- I got something. I don't

know if it was a f***ing bear.

It's probably a deer or

something. What is that?

Yo, what the f***

is that?

It looks like it's walking.

F***ing sh*t!

I think I missed the

road. What the hell?

There we go. This is it.

Riverfront.

Oh, that sh*t is overgrown.

- Is this for real it?

- Oh, my God.

Trust me, it's better

on the other side, guys.

Dude, I don't remember it

being this...

- Do you remember where we stop?

- No.

Bro, your uncle

has a cabin out here?

Yeah, dude.

- Um...

- What the f***, bro?

We're not getting past that.

- It's seriously just up here.

- We've got to walk from here.

What do you mean

you can't...

- What? Where do you want to go around?

- I don't know!

What are you

getting out for?

She's right. We have to walk from here.

- Are you serious?

- I'm not walking.

Black people

don't do this sh*t, man.

All right, guys. It's

just up here to the right.

Yo.

Anybody hear that?

Hear what?

I heard something, man.

There it is.

Is that it?

- Yeah.

Home, sweet home.

Seriously?

Trust me, guys. It looks a

lot better in the daylight.

- Oh, sh*t. Jesus.

- Watch out on the right.

There's a loose board.

Uh, whoa.

- Guess we didn't need to steal

the keys, huh? - Shut up.

Man.

Um, I mean, yeah, we just need to brush

off some of these leaves and stuff,

but, yeah, this is it.

Ew!

When's the last time

he was here?

Kind of looks like

somebody left in a hurry.

It's like a lovemaking

palace up in here.

Sweat stains on it.

Usually they got rose petals

and sh*t on the ground,

but we got leaves.

We got leaves. You can make

tons of magic up in here.

I mean, you just hop on,

you know?

Oh, baby!

All right, Brian.

- Yeah!

- So lame.

- Brian, quit it.

You're making it

all f***ing dusty.

F***ing job!

- What the hell was that?

- What was that?

Hello?

Hello?

Matt, hold on.

Matt. Wait up.

Don't go over there.

Seriously, there's

a f***ing pig in your cabin?

- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

- Oh, hell, no, man.

We'll get it out and we'll just...

- I'm not touching it!

It's your cabin. And I'm not

staying in this motherf***er.

It's a f***ing hog.

We're out in the woods.

- I'm not staying here.

- Me neither.

Come on, babe.

F*** that.

Matt.

What?

What is that?

You see anything?

No.

Just go to sleep.

It sounds like it's crying.

Close the window, dude.

- Do you hear that?

- Close the window.

Dude, you don't hear...

come on.

Oh, you're a dick.

Dude, do you think it was that sh*t

that Uncle Bob saw back in the day?

Shut up about that.

Why?

Not a word about any of that

stupid sh*t. I'm serious.

I'm serious.

Maybe it's that thing we hit.

Oh, my God.

What do we got here?

So this is pretty sweet.

Usually when you put a GoPro

camera inside of this casing,

it doesn't focus very well

underwater.

So I went out and I bought

one of these bad boys.

That's going to help me focus

underwater because it's got a flat lens.

So we're pretty much going to get

some pimp shots underwater today.

What's going on? Hey.

- Brian.

- What's up?

- Come swimming with us.

- Oh, I'll be right there.

Mm. What's up?

How you doing?

- What is this?

- It's called a little GoPro camera.

- You're an obsessed freak.

- What's going to happen is

I'm going to make you guys

look like super pimps

because we're going to have

the best YouTube video ever.

- You're lame. Let's go.

- Hold up, hold up.

- I got to get

this sh*t together.

Die, motherfuckers!

Good sh*t!

That's great sh*t!

Sh*t, dude, nice!

- What you got? What you got?

- Want to see what I got?

- I'd love to see what you got.

- I'm going to show y'all what I got.

- Hold up, this is how I'm about to do it.

- Make me proud.

YouTube ain't got

sh*t on us, man!

Oh! Damn!

I don't know. Todd may have

just shown up Matt for sure.

Uh-oh.

What've we got here?

Looks like a little

love walk going on.

God, I am so

going to hell for this.

Todd, you son of a b*tch.

I hate you,

you lucky bastard.

I shouldn't be

shooting this.

Oh, sh*t!

What the f*** is that?!

What the sh...

what the hell was that?

I know that's not Brian.

- Dude, be careful, man.

- There's something over there.

There's something over there.

It just ran up the ridge.

- Oh, yeah? I know what's over here, bro.

- I know. I'm serious, man.

There's something f***ing

over there, all right?

Brian, you're

a f***ing a**hole!

- What the f***, dude?!

God, you are such an...

You're recording your little

brother's friends in the woods?

What is wrong

with you?

I got your memory card.

Come get it.

- Yeah, whatever, dude.

- What's going on, man?

- What's going on? - Your brother's

recording us messing around in the woods.

Now you talking sh*t!

I will f*** you up!

- What's wrong with you?! Because

of that f***ing memory card!

There was a f***ing beast

on the memory card!

Okay, no need to name

Todd's dick.

Oh, that's really

f***ing cute.

- You're f***ing cute!

- I'm being f***ing serious.

- Serious? You're acting like an

eight-year-old. - Yeah. Come on, bro.

We're about to go shoot

some paintballs.

Film us doing that

or something, man.

That sounds like

a fun f***ing time.

- You d*cks.

- What'd you say?!

I said I'll

be in the woods.

This is definitely

where I was shooting.

He ran across that ridge.

Right there.

This is definitely

the spot.

I hear something.

See, years ago,

my uncle saw something

out here.

Something that freaked him

the f*** out.

Bad enough that he never came

back to his beloved hunting cabin.

He never used

the word Bigfoot,

but, man,

if it's out here,

Brian Tover's going to

get it on video.

'Cause that's

what I do, man.That's my thing.

Hey.

Hey, big man.

We can be cool, man.

We can be... we can be friends.

'Cause, like,

I'm hairy, too, man.

Chicks dig it, man.

Holy f***ing sh*t.

Look at the size

of this print.

Look at that thing.

There's some toe marks

in here.

Holy sh*t.

There's definitely

something moving.

Hello?

Hello?

Holy sh*t.

Holy sh*t.

I think I see something.

Hey.

We can be friends, man.

Holy sh*t.

I'm backing off.

It's your house.

You know where I'll be.

Yeah, you know

where I'll be.

It's 1:
37 a. m.

I think the noise

from up there at the cabin

is probably scaring

anything off.

It'll come, but...

man, as soon as

those lights go off...

then we're going to

have something.

Should be...

coming from

right over here.

Until then,

I'm just going to wait.

Trying to get some

creatures out of

the woods here.

Just got to mimic

their sounds.

Got to be very delicate.

- What are you doing?

- Huh? Oh, sorry.

Um...

I'm...

just recording some stuff.

I got some GoPros set up

all over the forest.

If anything moves

up in here,

Brian Tover's

going to catch it.

- Why?

- Why?

Ha. Why?

'Cause I'm making a video.

Because it's going to be huge.

This is going to be like

"Alien Autopsy" huge, you know?

Like YouTube

top f***ing ten.

Okay, whatever. Can you please just

be quiet? We're trying to sleep.

- I'm sorry.

- Good night.

I'll be quiet.

I'm just letting you know.

- Good night.

- All right?

Sh*t's going to be like...

like "Daily Show" huge.

I think those calls

did the trick.

And now

we motherfucking wait.

Whoa!

God damn it.

There's a noise.

I definitely

heard some sounds.

Just out here.

Sounds like

what I heard yesterday.

Looks like it found me.

F***.

Holy sh*t.

Hey, man.

Hello?

Mr. Sasquatch?

I just want to be friends.

Mr. Sasquatch?

Ow, ow, ow! Sh*t! Ow!

Motherf***er!

What the f***, dude?!

Ow!

Ow!

Man, that's f***ed up, dude.

You guys are f***ing a**holes.

You should have seen

your face, man.

Ow! Sh*t, dude!

You f***ing dick, man.

Mr. Sasquatch,

can I suck

your hairy cock?

Holy f***.

- We should get inside. Go, go.

- Holy sh*t.

Let's go.

Go, go, go, go, go.

What the f***?

Turn off the lights.

Turn off the lights.

Get the lights. Get the

lights. Get the lights.

Todd, what is that?

I don't f***ing know.

There's something out there.

That ain't no

f***ing animal, man.

- What the f*** is that?

- I know what it is.

Shut up.

Shut up.

Okay, we'll just stay

close and stay quiet.

Shh.

Guys, get back,

get back, get back.

Do you see anything?

- I want to go.

- Okay, listen.

- I want to go now.

- I know, baby. Listen.

Now might not be

the best time, okay?

- We're safe in the cabin.

- You need to calm down.

Guys, we're safe

in the cabin.

We have to stay calm,

okay?

We're going to be fine

as long as we don't

provoke it, okay?

There's no credible documented

cases of a Sasquatch attack.

Shut up about

a Sasquatch.

I'm serious.

- Shut up.

We're in f***ing East Texas,

okay? The big f***ing thicket.

There's a new sighting

every goddamn week.

Okay, guys.

Whatever it is,

we'll just leave

in the morning, okay?

- When the sun comes up.

- All right.

- Okay?

- Okay.

Turn the f***ing

flashlight off.

What?

Okay, okay.

Is it gone?

Brian, get your crazy ass

back here.

It's okay.

Brian.

It's gone.

It's okay.

There's nothing out here.

- What was that?!

- What the f*** is that?

What was it?

What'd you see?

- I think I got it on film.

- Got what?

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

You scared it off.

- It ran off.

- You scared it off.

- It ran off.

- Okay.

- I think I got it.

- Shut up!

- Bri, what was it?

It was f***ing Bigfoot, dude.

What was that?

- Oh, sh*t.

- Shut up, shut up.

What the f***?!

What is it?

You guys,

what is it doing?

Don't open... don't open

the window. Are you crazy?!

- Oh, sh*t.

- F***.

What the f***?

Sh*t.

What the...

oh, sh*t.

Motherfuck.

See if it starts, man.

- F***ing nothing.

- No?

- Come on, bro.

- Nothing!

Brian, let's go back.

I thought Brian said

they were peaceful.

- Brian, I thought you said...

- I thought you said it was peaceful.

That's what the f***ing

book said, all right?

Let's get the f*** back.

We just wait.

We have plenty of food and we'll

just wait until his uncle gets here.

My uncle's not coming.

Well, he's going to figure out

that we're not back eventually.

I stole the key.

From Uncle Bob.

Are you kidding?

What does he mean

he stole the key?

Because he doesn't let

anyone come out here.

So no one knows

we're here?

No.

Are you f***ing

kidding me?!

Why the hell, Matt?!

It's not his fault.

No, it's not

just his fault.

It's your f***ing fault, too,

because you knew, too!

- Dora, come on.

- I'm sorry.

Calm down, okay?

Matt, nobody knows

we're out here.

What the f***

are we going to do, bro?

Dude, hold up.

Matt, I'll go.

I'll go. I'll go.

I'm faster than you. No

offense, but I'm faster, dude.

I know these woods, okay?

Just take care

of the girls, okay?

Matt, wait.

I'll be back,

okay, babe?

- Baby, you don't have to do this.

- It's okay.

- It's okay.

- Matt, you don't have to do this, please.

Hey, listen, bro.

You get cell phone reception,

you make that call,

you get your ass back here,

all right?

- Later, man.

- Good luck, Matt.

Ride fast, bro.

- Like a demon.

Don't stop.

Damn it.

I know this isn't the weekend

you girls expected,

but this sh*t is serious.

I don't know how long it's

going to be before Matt gets back

and whatever the f***'s

out there is big

and if it gets in here,

we're f***ed.

Okay, we're going to take

all the furniture,

we're going to put it

against the windows and doors.

And, Brian,

what you're going to do

is put down

the f***ing camera.

- For real, bro.

- All right. Okay.

- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

- What do we got here?

Come check this out, guys.

Oh, sh*t.

Thank you.

Hello?

Check that out.

Let me see

what's going on.

- Babe, be careful.

- Yeah.

- What you got?

- Let me see if I can find a light. Hold up.

Oh, sick! Hey, guys!

Hey, we got a gun!

Hell, yeah.

You know what I'm saying?

- Dude, be careful where you

point that thing. - Watch it.

Do you even know

how to use that?

- Todd, you just pointed the gun at my face.

- Todd, watch it!

Will you check to see

if it's loaded?

It's probably not even loaded.

Calm down and sh*t.

Do you even know how to open it?

- Calm down, calm down.

I'm about to check.

Dude, really?

- It's loaded.

- Y'all going to be trippin...

Do you even know how to use a gun?

I play paintball.

How different can it be?

Come on.

Thank God. Okay.

9-1-1.

What's your emergency?

Yeah, we're trapped in a cabin

outside Route 212.

Hello? 9-1...

- 9-1-1. What's your emergency?

- Yeah, my name's Matt Tover.

- Hello? Is anyone there?

- We're outside Route 212 in a cabin.

- Hello? 9-1-1.

- Hello?

F***! Come on.

Come on.

Hello? Hello?- Please.

Hey, Uncle Bob.

It's...

Oh, God.

Matt, is that you? Matt?

- Uncle Bob, it's Matt!

- I'm having a bad connection.

- I'm at the cabin!

- Hello?

- Cabin?

- Uncle Bob, it's Matt. We're at the cabin!

Matt, did you say the cabin?

What the f***?!

Come on!

Holy...

Help!

Somebody!

F***!

Maybe he found somebody

on the road.

They're probably

on their way back right now.

We knew why my uncle never let

anyone come out to this place.

We just didn't believe him.

We should have never

come out here.

I'm sorry.

- We should probably get inside.

- It will get dark soon.

Matt's the man, guys.

He's bringing back help.

All right?

Oh, sh*t!

Holy f***ing sh*t, man.

Go, go!

Come on, Brian, come on!

Oh, sh*t. Move

something. Move something.

That's Matt's bike.

- F***.

Help me with this, man,

help me with this.

I'm trying, man.

Move it!

F***. F***.

F***. Grab that sh*t.

Wait, guys. Where is it?

I don't f***ing know, man.

That's Matt's bike.

- Oh, sh*t.

- Do you see it?

I can't see sh*t.

Check the other window.

- Can you see it? I

can't see sh*t out there.

It's waiting for it

to get dark.

It's waiting

for the night.

It's at the generator.

Oh, sh*t.

- It got the generator.

He's f***ing with us.

He's f***ing with us.

Okay, okay.

He's f***ing with us.

Oh, sh*t.

Todd, shoot it.

I don't want

to waste a shot.

F*** that!

Shoot it!

Be careful, man.

- F***.

Be careful... oh, sh*t.

- Where'd it go?

- It's okay.

Shh. It's gone, okay?

It can't get in.

F***er can't get in, okay?

He can't get in.

- Get in the room!

- Get in the room!

Go, go, go, go!

- Help me!

- Go, man.

What do we do now?

Okay.

Okay, guys.

Okay.

Let's go.

Sh*t.

I can't hold it!

Where did it go?

It ran off.

- It's gone.

- I think you got it.

Yeah.

Help me!

Guys, help her!

Help her!

- Help me!

- Get off her, motherf***er!

Beth!

Sh*t, come on.

Oh, sh*t.

Brian, help me!

Help me, man!

Go, go!

Get to the cellar!

- Got to get the gun. Come on. Get it.

It thinks we're outside.

He doesn't know

we're down here.

Shh.

- Be quiet, okay, baby?

- Please.

Is it gone?

Oh, sh*t!

Oh, sh*t! He looked at

me! He looked right at me.

Shh.

- He knows we're in here.

- Shut up, shut up.

He knows.

- Quiet. Be quiet. Shut up.

He doesn't know.

He doesn't know.

Oh, my God.

He knows.

He f***ing knows

that we're here.

Shoot him!

Motherf***er.

Let's go. Let's go.

Are you okay?

Lizzy.

Lizzy.

Is she breathing?

- Is she okay?

- Oh, my God.

Holy sh*t.

Hey, guys.

It's all clear up here.

We got it.

Oh, my God.

Jesus.

It's his f***ing bike.

We have to go.

We can't stay here.

See you soon, man.

What about Liz?

We'll come back

for her body.

Brian,

your cell phone working?

No.

- Yours?

- F***, no.

Hey. Hey.

It's over this way.

- What?

- It's the trail.

If we take the trail,

it's going to take us

half the time to get to 212.

Look at that sh*t, man.

There's no road out there.

I've been out here before.

Sure?

Ow.

It's straight down there.

Ah. F***.

Some f***ing shortcut

you got, man.

Dora. Dora.

Over this way.

- What?

- Over this way.

No, no, no. We keep going right up here.

I'm serious. We keep just

walking right up here.

Dude, I know

these f***ing woods.

Todd, he's been here before. Come on.

Yeah, whatever.

It better be over this way.

Come on.

Holy sh*t.

I think we did

something to it.

What the f***

did we do?

We didn't do sh*t.

We didn't do anything.

Holy sh*t.

It's Matt's bag.

Oh, sh*t.

- Matt?

- Wait, Dora.

Matt?

- Matt? Dora, slow

down. Slow down, Dora.

I see more blood.

Oh, God.

Matt...

No, no, no, no.

Sh*t.

Hey. Hey, baby.

Watch out, watch out.

Just leave me here.

Slow down, slow down.

I can't see sh*t.

Oh, sh*t. Oh, sh*t.

You all right, man?

We got to rest, bro.

Cut that light off.

Don't keep it on too long.

All right.

We got to find some cover,

somewhere not out...

somewhere not

out in the open.

Where the hell's

the 212, man?

We're getting close.

I remember this little

bridge and this road.

Hey, man.

I'm sorry about Liz, bro.

I think it found us.

Chill out, chill out.

F*** that.

That thing killed Liz.

- Todd! Todd!

- Brian, stay here. Stay here.

- I'm right here! Let's go!

- Stay here. Get under that.

Where this f***er at?!

- Todd!

I can do this all night,

motherf***er!

What are you doing?

Shut up!

How you going to kill

my friends?!

Shut up, Todd. Todd!

I'm killing this motherf***er

right now!

- Where you at?!

- Where you at, huh?!

- You can't even see it.

- What are you shooting at?

What's up?! I'm right...

- What the f***?

- Okay, okay.

Oh, sh*t!

- F***ing save the shell.

- Save the shell, bro.

- F*** it. Dude,

don't waste the shells.

The shell's

not coming out, man.

The shell's not

coming out, man.

Yo, we can't stay here.

We got to move.

We got to move. Dora,

come on. Dora, let's go.

- Let's go, let's go.

- We got to go.

Watch out, watch out!

Go, go, go, go, go, go.

Come on, y'all!

F*** that sh*t, nigga!

Go. Come on, man. We got to f***ing go.

- Brian, come on.

- Careful. Coming.

- You guys see it?

- No.

- Do you see it?

F***ing be careful, dude.

All right, man.

Where the f*** are we, bro?

Where the f*** are we, bro?

What is that?

Guys, guys.

There's people here.

There's people here.

They can help us.

- That looks deserted.

- That looks deserted, Brian.

Where the f*** are we, bro?

Where are we, bro?

Must be close to the 212.

Okay, let's get the f***

out of here, man.

Where...

Matt?

It's Matt! It's Matt!

- Matt!

- Yo, Matt!

- That's Matt.

- Matt!

- Matt!

- Matt!

- Brian.

- Brian, hold on a second.

- Shut up. I can hear him.

Oh, what the hell is that?

Matt?

- Where is he?

- Matt.

I don't hear him.

Matt?

Whoa, whoa. Yo.

Matt.

He sounds hurt.

- Matt.

- Come on.

Let's go in here.

Slow down.

Holy f***.

Matt?

Matt?

It's some sort

of a tunnel.

Or a nest

or something.

Matt.

He's down there.

He's down there.

- Hold this.

- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

What are you doing?

- What are you doing?

- I'm going in to get him.

- Come on, dude.

- You can't be going in there.

I don't have a choice.

That's my bro down there.

I've got this. I'll be

able to see in the dark.

Brian, it's all

we got left.

All right.

He'll be

all right, Dora.

You're all right.

Matt?

F***.

Which way?

Which way?

- Matt?

- Matt:
Huh?

- Huh?

- Matt?

Brian? Brian?!

Matt.
