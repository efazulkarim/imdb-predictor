Come on. I need to

No. Stay.

No. I won't you let you go.

I can't.

Have a good day.

Young woman: Wait. Is

someone still in here?

Young woman #2: It's

that quiet girl.

Hey!

Bye.

Witchcraft.

The official town

record blames the fire

on an unholy coven of

the devil's witches.

But, remember, history isn't

always what actually happened.

It's what people say happened,

what they wrote

down at the time,

and how others

interpret it later.

Slide, please.

Young woman: So there

were no witches.

Were there?

What do you think? Samantha?

Witches aren't real,

but scapegoats are.

They needed to blame somebody.

So why not make up a

story about witches?

Well, witches or no witches,

the fire wiped out the town.

The record lists

only four survivors,

and they founded a new

town just down the mountain

from where this very

school stands today.

Okay. Have a lovely

Christmas, everybody.

And remember that

your essays are due

right after break.

Young woman: I need,

like, 20 new dresses.

Young woman #2: Yeah.

Young woman: Oh, my

God. Are you serious?

Young woman #2: How can they

expect us to go to class

when there's murderous,

psychotic killer on the loose?

It's the third one this week.

That's less than

30 miles from here.

First one was in Danville.

Second was in Rivington.

And last night's

was in Somerset.

It's always the same thing.

They pick a house with

a nice couple in it,

and then they slash them up

until only ribbons of

their flesh remain.

Young woman: Ew.

What does the symbol mean?

Uh, probably some Satanic

shit, if you ask me.

Young woman #2: Well,

hopefully they'll catch them

before we get back from break.

Luckily, we'll be long

gone from here for a while.

Well, most of us, anyway.

Hey, Clara, why don't

you ever go home?

Do your parents hate

you or something?

Maybe she's an orphan.

Since you'll be here all

alone over Christmas,

I bet you'll have a lot of

time to work on your art.

What are you working on?

- Oh, my God.

Girls. Just what is this?

It's the Christmas

Killers, headmistress.

And where did you get it?

From Miss Tanner's boyfriend.

Horrible tragedy, but there's

no point scaring yourselves

with this tabloid trash.

Well, don't just sit

there. Get to class.

Yes, Headmistress.

I'll... I'll...

I'll talk to Jimmy.

Yes. Do.

Mm-hmm.

♪ It came upon a

midnight clear ♪

♪ That glorious song of old ♪

"Christmas Killers

strike again."

Do you think that's

suitable reading material

for impressionable young minds?

Uh...'Cause I was

thinking perhaps

we can invite the

Cincinnati Strangler

to give a lecture

on mass murder.

Look, I mean, they're asking me.

What am I supposed

to do... lie to them?

Well...

no, but we don't need

them scaring each other.

It's freaky enough

around here as it is.

I need a break from here

and all this isolation.

I shouldn't have agreed to stay.

And maybe next semester I

can get a public school job

and be back in civilization.

I know what you need.

You know the girls are also

calling you my boyfriend?

Uh-oh.

Well, we don't want that, do we?

Huh.

Miss Kramer. Your

father left word.

You can't just leave me here.

Mr. Kramer: Look,

let's not make a scene.

It's not fair.

It's just one Christmas.

You said... I know.

You promised.

I know.

I just want to go home.

Put the woman back on.

Yes, Mr. Kramer.

We understand.

Yes, of course. Plans change.

These things can't be helped.

No, it's no problem at all.

Oh, well, no, actually.

I won't be here.

But we have a teacher

and one of the other

girls who will be.

Wait! No, no.

No. What? What? No!

Stop! Oh! No!

Let's see what we got here.

No.

You were right.

There it is.

Told you. Just

like the others.

It's all in the book.

No. No, you don't

want to do this!

Oh, but we do.

No, please! No.

Yes.

No.

Almost there.

Thank you, Father.

You've been a great help.

Don't let it out!

Shut him up.

Young woman: We're

gonna go shopping.

All right. Treat for

the road... gingerbread.

- Oh, I'll take one.

- Me too.

Samantha?

Oh. Mm-hmm.

I'll get that for you.

All right, girls. Last

ride to the station...

leaves now.

I'll be back soon.

Can't wait.

You're staying?

Hey, hey.

I know this isn't ideal,

but we're gonna have fun.

I promise.

Well, someone's not feeling

the Christmas spirit.

Is that the last of them?

That's everybody who's leaving.

I'll be back in a

couple of hours.

Oh, I almost forgot.

I made you something

for Christmas.

Ah. Thanks, Jimmy.

If I'm not here

when you get back,

have a merry Christmas.

I have a feeling I will.

We're just getting word now

that this could be linked

to the murders from

a nearby county...

homicides which some

have already dubbed

the Christmas Killings.

Local holiday carolers are

being questioned by police,

whom are believed to

have been the last

to have seen Arthur and

Marion O'Malley alive.

Ever bake a pie from scratch?

Back to you, Roger.

No.

Do you want to learn?

Not really.

Little known fact...

The secret to the

perfect pie crust

is butter,

shortening, and vodka.

Do you want to grab a

bottle from the basement?

Cook keeps them in the pantry.

Not enticed by alcohol?

What kind of teenager are you?

Why don't you see

what Clara's up to?

No, thanks.

What's that saying?

"Blackvale girls look

out for each other."

Do you want to talk

about what's going on?

Because I know that this

is a difficult time and...

My stepdad said to try this

place out for one semester.

And I did.

But he lied.

He just doesn't want

to deal with me.

Nothing's been the same since.

I just don't have any

say over anything.

I'm just stuck.

Look...

you may feel trapped now.

But you're not gonna

be a teenager forever.

And soon you'll get to live

life on your own terms.

And in the immediate

future, there's pie.

Where in the basement?

It's in the nook,

right at the bottom

of the steps.

Thank you, Samantha.

Mm-hmm.

Who say they were under orders

to kill everyone in the village.

You're not supposed

to be down here.

And neither are you.

Miss Tanner sent me.

You've never been?

No.

You spend a lot

of time down here?

I keep to myself.

What are these?

The books they don't

want us to read.

Hey, I'm really sorry

about last night...

that I barged in

on you like that.

It's fine.

I didn't see anything.

There was nothing to see.

Hey.

Look what I have.

Do... Do you want some?

Sure.

I like your necklace.

Oh.

Thanks. My mom gave it to me.

How'd she die?

What?

That...

That's why you're here, right?

I overheard the

headmistress mention it.

Sorry. I didn't realize

it was a secret.

It's not a secret.

It's just personal.

I don't really want

the other girls here

to know about my life.

I can understand that.

It was a car accident.

You were there?

Yeah, I got out okay and

I ran to go get help.

But by the time I got back...

It was too late.

Your secret's safe with me.

Thanks.

Well, I'm... I'm gonna

go back upstairs.

I promised Miss Tanner I'd

help her bake a pie, so...

Are you gonna stay?

Um...

No. No, I'll go, too.

Okay.

It's a cold one

out there tonight,

so let's dream of celebrating

Christmas someplace warm.

Maybe a warning...

like, a sign we're on the

Just a hypothetical.

No need for anyone to respond.

Do you think this

is part of the plan?

It's all part of the plan.

We're on the right path.

Merry Christmas, folks.

Merry Christmas.

Oof. Looks like Santa's

this year, huh?

Anybody hurt?

No. No, w-we're fine, Officer.

Mm. Thank you.

- Just a little shaken up.

- Mm-hmm.

Mm. How fast were you going?

Oh, we were going

The deer just came

out of nowhere.

Where are you headed?

Home for the holidays.

Oh! Uh!

Oh, my God! I'm gonna die!

I'm dying!

Merry Christmas.

Hey, Clara, did you

hear what I said?

Dinner's almost

ready. Are you okay?

I'm fine.

Okay, grab these and

help me set the table,

'cause Jimmy should

be here any minute.

So did you know that Jimmy

and Miss Tanner are a couple?

Yes, I did.

Well, I guess Clara

knows everything.

Look...

I'm sorry you have to be here.

I know it's not your

ideal Christmas.

I'm just trying to

make the best of it.

If I come off as cold

sometimes, I just...

I don't really like

to let people in.

I'm not very good with

human interaction.

It's okay.

Neither am I, so...

Girls, get changed for dinner!

Okay, Miss Tanner.

How old is Jimmy?

He's 27.

He's pretty handsome.

- He sure is.

- So you like him?

Of course I like him.

Yeah, but do you love him?

Oh, shush.

I don't know. Maybe.

What do you think, Clara?

Sounds like love to me.

Sounds like Prince

Charming's back.

Sounds like Prince

Charming forgot his keys.

Hello, ma'am. Hmm?

So sorry to bother you, it

being Christmas Eve and all,

but do you mind if we come in?

My friend here,

he's hurt real bad.

Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry. I'm

not supposed to let anyone in.

I'm sorry.

- Please.

- Um, why don't you...

I'll... I'll call

for help for you,

and you can wait out here.

Hey. That's not a good idea.

Check the kitchen.

If I remember, there's a

first aid kit behind the door.

Just a bandage and some alcohol - would help so much.

- What?

- How did you know that?

- Class of '64.

My picture's on the

wall over there.

Come on. Help us out here.

Blackvale girls are

supposed to look out

for each other, right?

- That's right.

- Yeah.

Aah!

Still the same.

I guess some things

never change, huh?

What are your names?

I'm Samantha. This is Clara.

And that's Miss Tanner.

Miss Tanner have a first name?

Rose.

Rose.

How pretty.

Hey, you look familiar.

You have an older

sister or something?

What happened?

I got shot.

Why were you shot?

I don't know.

'Cause you'd have to ask

the person who shot me.

Well, there's... there's

no entry hole and...

it just scraped the skin.

That's what I said.

He wanted to go to a hospital.

I said, "You don't

need a hospital.

You just need a nice lady

with a first aid kit."

There was so much blood.

It smells good in

here. Christmas dinner?

I am so sorry. We can't

invite you to stay.

We don't need an invitation.

Nothing fancy like that for us.

This place is so much nicer

than the one in Somerset.

The other one had

small-town charm,

but this one is

far more elegant.

Wow. That turkey

looks mighty fine.

And mashed potatoes.

I could certainly go

for some of those.

You girls like mashed potatoes?

That's enough. Your

friend is bandaged up.

Good as new.

Please leave.

But it's Christmas.

Girls, why don't

you go upstairs?

Don't... go... anywhere.

Oh.

Girls. Run.

Now.

Oh, no. She's got scissors.

Where are you going?

Oh, don't leave.

Mm.

Someone gonna get them?

Wait.

What?

Come on.

Where are you going?

Where are you going?

We need to get out of here.

We need to hide.

All right.

Girls, let's cooperate, huh?

You're only delaying

the inevitable.

Come out.

No?

Fine.

Hmm.

Ha!

Clara! Run!

Stop!

Give me the knife. Give

me the fucking knife.

I'm gonna snap her neck.

Clara...

Come on.

Good girl.

Let's go.

Chop-chop.

We're gonna have a white

Christmas this year.

The National Weather

icy conditions and

more snow on the way.

sure he felt welcome.

One was on the phone.

We have a lot

But first, best to

get our strength up

with a meal lovingly

prepared by our friend here.

Yum.

- Thanks, Rose.

Before we eat, we say...

grace...

- Grace.

Just like my daddy taught me.

Join hands. Mm.

- Oh, uh...

- Oh. Whoops.

Yeah. Yeah.

Good bread. Good meat.

Good God. Let's eat.

Amen.

Oh. Mmm.

How do you like

going to school here?

- Wine? Okay.

- Mm. Thank you.

The headmaster still

That's pretty good.

What dorms are you in?

I was in the south dorm.

Ahh!

Great biscuit.

And good gravy.

No lumps.

- You like it, Grant?

- Oh, yeah.

I don't know why you thought

that you wouldn't have enough

food for everyone, Rose.

There's plenty here.

You should really try some.

Yeah, you should try it.

Ahh!

Here.

Eat it.

Untie me, and I will.

Oh, there's no

need. You can reach.

No. Don't do it.

Come on, Rose.

They're delicious.

No.

I think she needs help.

See?

Wasn't that good?

You did such a lovely job.

Get out of here, you murderers!

I know who you are.

You killed those people,

and the police...

the police are coming for you,

and they're gonna get you.

Oh, no. The police

are coming to get us.

Oh, no.

Tell me something, Rosie.

Doug, can you clean her up?

I can't look at her.

Why do I got to?

Just do it, Doug.

Take valuable time.

There.

There.

There.

Spick-and-fucking span.

Thanks.

Now, tell me something.

Do you love your boyfriend?

What?

Do you love him?

Yes.

Wow! Great.

Because I think he feels

the same way about you.

Maisie, if you'll please.

Make a move, and I

slit your throat.

Oh!

Aww.

No.

My dearest Rose...

I've waited an awfully

long time to do this

because I wanted

it to be special.

And what could be more special

than a night like this?

The greatest gift you can

give me is a single word.

Here.

We can do this

next part together.

You...

Fuck you!

I think she said yes.

Ah! Damn it, Jude!

You got blood all over the food.

Hey, you've had enough.

You don't want to get chubby

like Grant over there.

Besides, we have so many more

festivities before midnight.

We've got to stay on schedule.

Here...

wear this.

It's lovely.

He must have saved up for it.

What's this?

She's been, uh, ahem...

very cooperative.

So...

are you the kinds of people

that like to open your

presents on Christmas Eve

or Christmas Morning?

Eve. I just can't wait.

Oh, I want this one.

That belongs to Samantha.

Can't you see her

name on the card?

Oh. Of course.

Sorry, Samantha.

"Dear Samantha...

I'm so happy to be spending

the holiday with you.

My apologies. This gift

was a little last minute.

I'd bought this for myself,

but I know you love

the color blue,

and I think it would look

so much better on you.

Rose."

Jude, aren't we on

a schedule here?

There's always time

for presents, Doug.

This is beautiful.

Do you think it's gonna fit me?

Now, now, Maisie.

Give it to Samantha.

It belongs to her.

She should wear it.

Don't try anything funny now

that your hands are free.

Go ahead, sweetie.

Put the dress on.

We need to make sure it

fits right, don't we, Rosie?

I can't with everyone watching.

Nonsense.

We're all friends here.

Mm-hmm.

I can't.[Sighs] Clara...

go stand in front

of your friend.

Let her have some privacy,

if that's what she needs.

Come on!

Let's go. Let's go.

Ah.

How beautiful.

Okay, who's up next?

Ahh.

"Merry Christmas."

"Dear Jimmy..."

Guess we don't

need this anymore.

Here, Grant. You can have it.

It's a necktie.

How perfect.

- This one is for you.

Oh, thank you. You

shouldn't have.

"Dear Clara, I know you're

eager to see the world someday.

I'm sure you'll have many

wonderful adventures.

Rose." Hmm.

Oh, a travel book.

You're not missing much.

Thank you, Rose.

Mm, it's almost midnight!

Time for our presents.

The party has just begun.

It's gonna be the best

Christmas of your lives...

and likely the last,

so let's make it really count.

Maisie, give me a hand.

Hold on.

Fire. Music.

Ahh.

What do we got here?

See? It's like I told you.

They fit together like a puzzle.

Mm-hmm.

If you get the chance,

get to the guard booth.

It's dead head

here, but there's...

there's a separate line

at the guard booth. Okay?

We're gonna get out of here.

Let me tell you a story.

Yeah?

My daddy was a preacher.

You wouldn't know it

to look at me now,

but I grew up in the church.

Every Sunday, there I was down

on my knees, hands together,

watching my daddy

as he preached.

"Praise the Lord!"

Every eye in the house on him,

waiting on his every word to

deliver hope and salvation.

Now, the simple

people of Greenwood

came to my daddy's church,

and they prayed hard.

"Please, don't let them

close the factory, God."

"Don't let them

draft my only son."

"Don't let this

cancer kill me."

But most of them,

their prayers went unanswered.

Factories closed.

Young men went to

war, and old men died.

I know what you're thinking...

Maybe there is no God.

But you know what?

I don't think that's

true. I think he's real.

The only problem is,

he doesn't give a fuck.

He's not listening.

It's not prayers that

get God's attention.

Oh, no.

It's sacrifice.

The universe runs on sacrifice.

The powerful sacrifice

the weak and innocent

every day to gods or devils

and get rewarded for it.

And now it's our turn.

Tell them, Maisie.

They're part of it now.

They deserve to know.

There's something

special about this place,

tracing back to the old

days before it was a school.

When I was a Blackvale girl,

not much older than

the two of you,

I found a book of magic.

Real magic. Blood magic.

And when they saw what I was

up to, they kicked me out,

but not before I

could grab this.

Hm.

"The Demon Rite."

We followed this to the letter.

Every murder,

every drop of blood

brought us one step closer.

Brought us here...

back to Blackvale.

- Mm, mm, mm. Where, tonight,

we can finish the

ritual, bring him forth.

A demon who will grant

us unimaginable power.

All we needed was

Maisie's knowledge,

Grant's muscle, and my vision.

Oh, and Doug's car.

He's got a really nice car.

Oh, wow. Real

nice. Thanks, Jude.

Oh, and, of course,

your sacrifice.

Sanguinem innocentius...

the blood of the innocent.

We only need one of you

to complete the ritual.

But don't get your hopes up.

We're still gonna kill you all.

You're insane.

What? What was that?

You're insane!

You're murdering people

because of... of some fairy

tale you found in some book?

Just please, please.

Please just let...

Let them go.

They're just girls.

They don't... They don't

need to be involved in this.

I don't think you know

how this works, Rosie.

That's exactly why they

need to be involved.

Yeah. The blood

of the innocent.

That's the kind of

thing that demons love.

They practically dine on

little girls like you.

But then again,

what could be more innocent

than a sweet little

schoolteacher?

We got a feisty one!

No! Ciroc...

king of hell...

Feast on this lamb of God!

No!

Aah!

So... what now?

Is the demon here?

Hello, demon?

Come out, come out,

wherever you are.

Maisie?

Something just happened.

The lights, the fire.

You guys saw that, right?

We did everything we

were supposed to do...

the... the blood

of the innocent,

the sigil, the...

the skin puzzle.

Just give it a

minute. Hold on.

Maisie...

did we just go on a murder

spree for no reason?

No. The demon is

supposed to show.

Are you just making

this shit up?

Hello?! Did you guys

just see what I saw?

Something happened.

And the sigil inscribed

on all those people...

- Did I make that up, too?

- Wait, wait!

There has to be something

we're missing here.

What did we get wrong?

I don't know.

- Well, think!

- I'm trying to.

Okay, I'll...

I'm gonna find the book.

Okay, let's go.

Watch them.

Wait up.

Ahh...

We have to get out of here.

They're gonna kill

us if we don't.

Fuck! I'm out.

Grant, help me find

something to drink.

What are you gonna ask it for?

What?

The demon.

I assume you're summoning it

because you want

something from it.

None of your business.

What would you

ask for, Samantha,

if you could have anything?

'Cause that's how

it works, right?

You just wish something, and

then the demon grants it?

Like a genie?

You think it's real, though.

What?!

We've seen the news stories.

You've killed a lot of people.

It's real.

Maisie has proved it

time and time again.

Is it, though, Grant?

I mean, how do we know?

You know? How do

we really know?

I mean, we're trying to raise

a demon, for Christ's sake.

Just because a bunch

of religious weirdos

get matching tattoos

doesn't make it real.

And, Jesus, I got

shot because of it.

I've seen people get shot.

That's barely a scratch.

So...

here we are.

A pretty girl bats

her eyes at me,

says I'll get anything

I want out of it.

And I believed her.

Because you want her.

Maisie?

Of course I want Maisie.

Everybody wants Maisie.

Even this guy wants Maisie.

Don't let the whole

shell-shocked vet thing

throw you.

This guy has killed for Maisie.

But Jude's in charge?

No, no, no.

He talks the most.

But no, none of us are

here because of Jude.

Maisie's the one

with the nightmares.

Sorry. The visions. Mm.

Maisie's the one who

knew about the book.

About this place.

It's all Maisie.

Jude's just good at

the actual killing.

No offense, Grant.

Grant's a stone-cold

killer, too, but...

Jude's a touch more

theatrical about it.

Maybe it's not a literal demon.

Maybe it's a demon force.

Huh?

I feel something. Do

you feel something?

What do you think Maisie is

doing right now with Jude?

Why do you think they

ran off together?

This whole thing

is a fucking joke.

You asked me what I

want. I want Maisie.

But I'm clearly not any

closer to getting her.

Not even with this fairy-tale,

blood-of-the-innocent bullshit.

The first time I came

down here was on a dare.

I was only supposed to be

down here for a few minutes,

but then my friends

locked me in.

I was down here all

night by myself.

But that's the night

I found the book,

so who's laughing now?

I can't take this

anymore. I need a drink.

There's got to be some

booze here somewhere.

There's vodka.

In the basement.

Now we're talking.

Watch 'em.

Now what?

I hope it's still here.

What year were you again?

'64.

'64.

There we go.

Look at all these assholes.

Good thing you left this school.

That's it.

Perfect.

You should let her go.

She's not what you want.

What do you know about

what I want, kid?

You're not like the others.

You're different.

You're a soldier.

Sit down.

You're going along

with all of this

because you want something.

You need orders.

You need a mission.

I said, "Sit"!

Hell is waiting for you.

Hell is waiting for you.

Hell is waiting for you.

Hell is waiting for you.

You look good in glasses.

Hell is waiting for you.

Hell is waiting for you.

Where the hell is the basement?

No.

No.

Oh, more hallway. Good.

I want to show you something.

What are you doing?

Okay. Stop...

You should let her go.

Yoo-hoo?

Jude and Maisie?

We better figure this out

or get the hell out of here.

Bingo.

I just...

I can feel him.

The demon we've summoned.

We're gonna get

everything we wanted.

All of its power.

Me and you...

as one.

Can you feel him, Maisie?

Jude. Jude, you're hurting me.

You did it.

We did it.

You brought him forth.

You summoned him.

Now all we need is

sanguinem nocendium!

Sanguinem nocendium!

Sanguinem nocendium!

Aah!

Jesus.

Jesus, Maisie. What's

wrong with you?

I don't think you're

feeling like yourself, Jude.

Maybe I'm not.

But maybe I'm more...

because I can feel him.

Don't you want to

feel him with me?!

Don't fucking touch me!

You'll see.

Won't be long now.

Doug.

Did he hurt you?

No, I'm fine.

I-I wasn't watching.

I was just...

Well, I-I was just

looking for you.

What did he say?

Sanguinem...

This is...

There's more.

"Blood of the guilty."

Blood of the what?

Let's go, Clara.

No, no. I'll stay

and keep them busy.

Don't be crazy.

We can make out together.

Come here.

I just don't understand.

If you don't go now...

you'll die.

Where are you?

Where are you?

Where are you?

Hell is waiting for you.

It's the blood of

our other victims.

You've seen a lot of

blood, haven't you?

We kill people, like

they say on the news.

Yes.

But what about before?

Over there.

Over there, too.

When they shoot, we shoot.

Somebody dies. That's the job.

But it isn't just a job, is it?

When you're out

there, in the jungle,

far from home...

knowing that a Vietcong soldier

might already have you

lined up in his sights.

They think you're just a

big, dumb killing machine.

How did you end up

with them anyway?

You had friends in your platoon.

Brothers.

Where are they?

Gone.

It was a massacre.

We walked right into it.

I just...

I kept shooting, but

they kept coming.

I didn't know what to do, so...

I hid under a pile of bodies

until the shooting stopped.

They all died.

You didn't.

I should have.

Instead, they gave me a medal.

Sole survivor.

What a joke.

You wish...

You wish you hadn't

let them all down.

You wish you could

have saved them.

Yes.

Or died trying.

Yes.

It's not too late

to get your wish.

But first, I have one

last mission for you.

Soldier...

killer...

sole survivor...

death has marked you.

Want to make it permanent?

Where are you, Ciroc?

Show yourself.

We did the things.

We did everything you

asked. We killed the people.

We came to the place.

Everything you showed Maisie.

I know you're here.

I can feel you.

It's time to reveal yourself.

Don't fuck with me!

Insane.

We did it wrong.

Fuck. It all happened so fast.

And I-I wanted to

grab this whole book,

- but they caught me.

- Wrong? How?

It wasn't a summoning ritual.

It was an unbinding one.

Meaning?

We thought we came here

to summon the demon.

Yeah?

But it's been here all along.

And it lured us here.

We set it free.

Ciroc!

You owe us.

You owe me!

Where are you?!

Where are you?

Where...

are you?

Are you...

Am I...

Yes.

Yes.

Where else would it be?

I'm the vessel.

Okay, so...

the demon is here.

Like, it's invisible.

I always thought a demon needed

to take some kind of form,

take over your body.

I don't know.

Oh, I wish you'd known a

bit more before we embarked

on this little project of yours.

Anyway...

if... if it's wanting

to be set free,

then it's not free, right?

Like, it's... stuck here?

What?

What?

No way.

Come with me.

Okay.

Hold this.

I knew she looked familiar.

The sister?

I think we should

go. Should we go?

Yeah.

What do you mean?

Where are you going?

We're not done here.

We're just getting started.

Jude, did you...

Are you okay?

Ah, never better, baby.

Hey. We figured it out.

Clara's the demon.

What? The girl, Clara.

She's the demon.

Clara's not the demon.

I'm the demon.

No, you've lost your mind.

Look. She's in every photo.

She's as old as the school.

She's clearly the demon.

Oh! I see what's

going on here.

I step away for a

minute to clear my head.

And now you two are

buddy-buddy, playing detective,

solving the case of the demon

at The Blackvale

School for Girls.

Nancy fucking Drew

over here and her dog,

Toto, too.

Hey, back the hell off.

Oh, dog. Doggy.

You think she gives

a shit about you?

Jude.

Oh! Ah!

Fuck.

Ah, that actually fucking hurt.

Guys!

Jude, stop.

Your time's up, Dougie boy.

It's all coming to an end.

Yeah! Aah!

You figured it all out.

Good for you.

But you can't leave now, Maisie.

We're gathering the guests

for my going-away party.

Let me out of here.

Hey, get the fuck away from me!

Aah! Aah!

Yes.

Operator. Hi!

I need the police. One moment.

Hi. What's the emergency?

Yeah, hi.

Yes.

I'm at the Blackvale School - for Girls.

- Okay.

And the Killers...

the Christmas

Killers, they're here.

Slow down. Is this some

kind of prank call?

No, this isn't a joke.

- They've killed people.

- Who have they killed?

My teacher and the

security guard.

Where are they now?

They're in the main building.

And my friend is

trapped in there, too.

Uh-huh. And where are you?

I'm at the security booth

by the main entrance.

Okay. Stay calm.

What's your name?

My name is Samantha.

Samantha Kramer.

Samantha.

No, they don't know I got out.

Hang on there.

But what about Clara?

They're gonna kill her.

I think they're doing

some sort of ceremony.

Stay put till we get there.

Okay. Hurry.

Please hurry.

Blackvale girls look

out for each other.

Fuck.

Let us out of here.

Grant! Come on, buddy.

Let us out.

Please. Please.

Come on, buddy.

Let me out.

Help!

Somebody help us!

Help!

Someone help us!

- Nobody can hear you.

- What is this?!

Let us go.

Come on, buddy. Let me out.

What is this?

You wanted a ceremony.

Here it is.

Grant...

I am the demon.

I command you...

let us out right fucking now!

All right, listen to Jude,

because he's the demon.

You were right, Jude...

The strong gain power

when sacrificing the weak.

And you are very good

at sacrificing the weak.

I watched you kill in my name,

paint my mark in blood

for the world to see,

and finally you came here

to me to shed the blood

of the innocent within

these very walls.

Well done.

What are you?

Something much older than

you could possibly imagine.

You think these guys

would do anything for you?

Men feared me, worshiped

me, died for me...

until they turned on me.

The fire that

wiped out the town.

They were summoning you.

And then they

changed their minds.

Didn't understand what they

were getting into, I guess.

I have been trapped in this

place, in this building,

in this body for

a very long time.

They thought they destroyed me,

but I made the best

of a bad situation.

I was weak, but it didn't take

much for me to assume this form,

to hide in plain sight,

and to cloud the minds

of students, teachers.

Who pays attention to the

quiet girl in the corner?

You certainly didn't.

Did you, Maisie?

What, you thought you found

that old book by accident?

You've restored my power.

I am so grateful.

But there's one last step.

One last sacrifice needed

to break their bonds

and set me free.

The blood of the guilty.

Guess who that is.

Us. You...

You're gonna kill us.

If I could kill you myself,

you'd have been dead

the second you walked

through the door.

No.

You have to do it to

yourselves or to each other.

So, who is ready to make

the first sacrifice?

We can start small.

Mm...

No.

Hmm?

Mm-hmm...

Mm.

No, no, no, no. No, no. Grant.

Grant.

- Grant, what are you doing?

What is your offering?

Are you kidding me?

I'm not giving you anything.

If you don't give on

your own, then we'll have

to take something from

you as punishment.

Grant, don't. Don't do it.

Jude, make them stop.

- One last chance.

- Jude!

Grant, you choose.

- What are you doing?

- No! Don't...

- Grant.

- No, no. No, no!

Stop! Grant!

- Dude, stop!

- No, no. No, no.

Fuck you, Grant! Fuck you!

Stop it!

Stop, Grant, stop!

Fuck you, you fucking demon!

Shit!

Great. Who's next?

Shit.

- Ah.

- What the fuck?

Doug's turn.

Hmm?

Maisie, I love you so much.

I love you so much,

even without the hair.

It's nice.

Shut up, Doug!

Doug, ever the

hopeless romantic.

A metaphoric sacrifice...

so sweet.

But I was hoping for

something a little more...

visceral.

- Grant.

- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

I want to offer blood the

way Grant offered blood.

Wonderful. Stick

out your hand.

No! Fuck!

Fuck! No!

Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

You cut off my fingers!

Next. Fuck you!

What about our reward?

You got the blood

of the innocent.

Aren't we supposed to

get something, too?

Don't you see, Jude?

You're getting it.

You fucking cut off

my fingers, man!

- This is it.

- Fuck you!

I want power! Influence! Fame!

Well, your wish is my command.

When the tabloids

find your bodies,

you'll be on the cover of every

newspaper in the entire world.

You'll be talked

about for generations.

- You're welcome.

- Fuck you.

I don't think Jude's listening.

Grant, can you

get his attention?

Grant, you mother...

Aah!

Fine. You're right.

Ever since I found that damn

book, I've been obsessed.

Even though I knew people

would die, I had to come back.

And I had... I had to

know if it was real.

And now you know.

Clara?

And...

And I wish I didn't.

It's okay.

And... And none of you would

be here if it wasn't for me.

And I'm... And I'm sorry.

Touching.

Also interesting to note that

death doesn't seem to matter

unless you and your friends

are the ones staring

down its throat.

Well, this has been fun,

but it's almost sunrise.

And, like Jude said,

we're on a schedule.

- Grant. Wait, wait, wait.

No, no. Grant. No.

It's Dougie. It's your friend.

No!

No, Grant, no!

Aah!

You bastard.

You killed him.

He was one of our own.

And you killed him.

Grant. Grant. Listen to me.

You know I've always

been your greatest ally.

I took you in.

Don't you dare bring that

thing close to me again.

I am the vessel.

Obey the vessel.

No.

No, Grant.

Grant, please.

Grant, please, please.

Hey, we... we can

get out of here.

Just us.

We can... We can go anywhere.

We can go anywhere you want.

We can just get in

the car. We can drive.

And... And now that Jude and

Doug are dead, it's just us.

And we can... We

can really be happy.

Don't listen to her.

- We'll do whatever we want.

- You know?

- You have a mission. Finish it.

Jude was possessive,

and Doug was jealous.

She's lying to you. Lying

like she always does.

She's using you. She

doesn't care about you.

You know what you need

to do... kill her.

- Serve your purpose.

- You can do whatever you want.

- Kill her!

- Enough!

Well, that's disappointing.

Three down, one to go.

Um...

I'm here to save you.

What is going on in here?

She's the demon?

Clara, stop it.

How dare you?

Clara, what is this?

What is going on?

Are you gonna kill her?

I can't kill her, but

I can fuck with her.

Drive her crazy until

she kills herself.

Clara! Stop it!

I have waited so long.

I'm so close.

And you're ruining it!

I told you to leave.

Why didn't you listen to me?

Why did you come back?

Well, I couldn't just leave you.

They were going to kill you.

Kill me?

You stupid girl. I wish

they could kill me.

What your kind has done to

me is something far worse.

Do you know what it's like

being stuck here

year after year here?

I've met millions of

versions of you, Samantha.

You want to be liked.

You want to fit in.

It's so pathetic.

It's so... human.

But I thought we were friends.

We're not friends. We've

never been friends.

You're a meager little mortal

with your meager

little mortal concerns.

So sad. You're stuck

here for Christmas.

Poor Samantha.

Try being stuck here forever.

How do you think I feel?

No, Clara.

I care about you.

You care about me?

You care about me?!

Please, let me in.

Then let me out.

Oh.

You actually did it.

You freed me.

Yeah, well...

I heard Blackvale

girls are supposed

to look out for each other.

Yeah. Yeah.

So what are you gonna do now?

Are you gonna leave?

Do you want to come with me?
