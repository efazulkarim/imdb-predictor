- So, Ben, have you ever
sat for her?
- God, no. No.
Her subjects are, um,
mothers, babies
so she has no use for me.
- I've read
about your latest show.
Congratulations.
It must be a real thrill to do
all that hard work come good.
-Yeah, it went down a storm
and she got a couple
of commissions
which is always a bonus.
- Your success will really help
your application.
Everyone here at the home
is thrilled
that you've applied for custody.
I know that
your recent relationship
with your daughter
hasn't been easy
but Chloe needs this
as much as you do.
-Hi, Chloe.
- I'll leave you to it.
- Wow, my photo of you
is really out of date.
So, Louisa said that you were
thinking about our offer.
Come and stay with us,
see how you feel.
We've got a great bedroom.
The house is in a quiet
neighborhood,
but it's just a short
train ride...
-why are you doing this?
-I was hoping..
Now that I've moved back
for good
that you and I could spend
some time together.
- Nine years ago
was when I needed you.
Didn't want me then.
-I did.
I..
I... I..
-Don't come here again.
Don't call me.
Just leave me the fuck alone.
Okay?
- Chloe, please don't leave.
- Jess, you know how
important tonight is for me.
Will you please get ready?
We're going to be late.
Jess?
I've already moved this dinner
twice because of you.
- Tira, do you mind
if we pick this up next week?
-Of course.
- We need to leave
in 20 minutes.
-Bye, Ben!
Can you hold her?
-Um, yeah.
Okay. Hi.
Oh.
- Don't be sad
about your daughter.
A mother's love for her child
is very powerful.
This is a talas.
Its magic will help
your daughter
see the love in your heart.
-It's pretty. Thank you.
-You're welcome. Bye.
-What?
- Fucking kids.
- Do you remember
when we used to play that game?
You should see Mary's house now.
They knocked down
the whole street.
Come.
I wanna show you something.
- But I haven't finished.
- It looks great to me.
You know kids are scared
to come here now?
They say that 'cause Mary's dead
there's no one left
to feed the demon.
They reckon
it's still trapped in there
waiting for someone to knock.
- Why are we even here?
You know I hate this place.
- Once to wake her from her bed.
Twice to raise her
from the dead.
If you knock her door,
she still hears it.
Sooner or later she comes
knockin' for you.
- That's not funny.
She took Michael.
-It's just a story.
I'm sorry.
I, I didn't wanna upset you.
Look. I'll prove it to ya.
Gonna have a go?
-Danny?
Danny!
- Hah!
- Oh, fuck!
You are such a shit!
- That was great.
-Why would you do that?
-Your face.
Wait, I'm sorry,
I'm joking, I'm joking.
Come on. You alright?
-Danny.
It's coming.
Get out.
Run.
-Sorry, did I wake you?
-I don't feel right, chlo.
-Hang on. Two secs.
Sorry, that's so creepy.
I thought someone was
at my door.
Danny?
- Danny's phone.
Leave a message.
-Where are you?
Just call me, okay?
Danny?
- Run for your life.
-Danny.
- Chlo..
-Danny.
- Do you mind?
The cleaners wanna do the room.
- Yeah, sorry.
I'll just get my phone.
Someone open the door! Help!
Someone open the door!
Someone open the door!
Open the door! Open the door!
Help!
Help, open the door! Please!
Please!
-What's going on?
-Ben.
-What?
-There's someone here.
-What?
-Wait.
-No, no. Wait there.
-Can I stay?
- Okay. Bye.
So, um, they said
that it's okay for a few nights
but you have to call Louisa
in the morning.
- It's lovely to have you here,
Chloe.
Okay, I'll see you
in the morning.
-Sorry about the mess.
We've been redecorating.
We were really hoping that
you would pick
the paint color for the room
and, uh, you know, just
make the room your own, really.
Yeah.
The bathroom
is through that door.
And, um, Ben and i
are just across the hall
if you, if you need anything.
-This place is huge.
Did you win the lottery
or something?
-Um, no.
Although sometimes
it does feel like it.
The last few years
have been amazing.
The only thing missing was you,
Chloe.
- Well, I'm not gonna
stay very long.
Couple of nights maybe.
- Listen, about
what you said before.
I know that I can't change
what I did.
-I'm pretty tired.
-Of course.
Um..
See you in the morning.
-Can you leave it open?
Please.
-Yeah.
I'm really glad you're here,
Chloe.
She hates me.
I don't blame her.
- Sweetheart,
you can't change the past.
What matters
is that you're trying
to do the right thing now.
Look, I've got to go.
I'll be back for dinner,
alright?
- Why are we having
this conversation again?
I thought we agreed
there would be no more
work trips for a while.
-I know, I know, I'm sorry.
Look, it's only for a few days.
-Get someone else to go.
-I would if I could.
Some new client has insisted
i attend personally.
-Hey, Chloe.
It's carrot and coriander soup.
-I'll alert the media.
- Do you like it?
It's organic.
-Mm-hmm.
-Thank you.
-So, I was thinking
maybe tomorrow
you could give me a hand
in the studio?
It would be a big help to get
the new collection ready.
- Well, maybe she doesn't want
to be an artist.
Some people have real jobs,
you know.
-What, like being a banker?
- Hah, okay.
You got me there.
We are a bunch of shits.
- You enjoy his money though,
don't you?
- Actually, we, we bought
the house together.
-Did you?
- Just to be clear,
i didn't need her to
I'm bloody loaded,
but your mother is
a very stubborn,
independent woman
and those hideous things she
makes sell for a fortune.
Christ!
Hey.
- What's the matter?
- Hey, let me.
Let me do it.
Maybe she doesn't like
coriander.
I'll be back soon.
- Yeah. Bye.
Chloe?
Who are you?
- Przepraszam.
-No!
Jesus!
-I heard you shouting.
-Um, it was just a dumb dream.
I'm fine.
-What was it?
-Um..
There was this, um
old woman
with red hair
and she was crying
and she had a... a knife and..
She killed herself.
- When I was a kid, there was
this strange, old woman
who lived near the home.
She had this long,
dirty red hair
everyone called her ginger.
And she never came out of
the house, but you'd see her
in the window sometimes..
And people started saying
that she was a witch.
And so after she died,
stories started
that if you went
and knocked on her door
she would come and get you.
Danny and I went there
the other night.
We knocked.
And now Danny's gone
and I think
she's coming for me next.
- Oh, sweetie,
it was just a bad dream.
-Please don't let her get me.
-Okay.
Nothing is gonna happen to you.
You're safe, okay?
Morning.
I think we overslept.
-Sorry.
-Don't be.
Oh.
It's okay.
Tira?
-Am I early?
- Oh. God. Um, you know,
i must have totally forgotten.
Uh, just give me a second.
Alright, let's go.
We're gonna finish
by the time she's walking.
-That soon?
- I thought you might like
some coffee.
-Oh, gosh, would I ever?
Thank you.
Um, sorry, tira,
this is my daugh..
Um, sorry.
Uh, this is Chloe.
-I'm sorry, I have to go.
-Tira?
-I think I have to go.
-Tira?
What's goin' on?
-Nothing. I can't stay.
-Tell me.
- Be careful, Jess.
You can't help her.
She belongs to someone else.
There's a darkness around her.
Trust me, Jess,
i know about these things.
She's marked
by something terrible.
-What do you mean?
- How's your mother
been treating you?
- Okay.
- You look upset.
- I'm fine.
- Are you both getting on okay?
- Yeah.
-Are you okay?
-Chloe?
-This is detective boardman.
- Don't worry,
she's not in any trouble.
Friend of Chloe's, Dan chambers,
he's been reported missing.
I'm just following up.
I was just telling her
there's probably
nothing for her to worry about.
- Right. And, um,
you two know each other?
-Oh, yes, we..
We've known each other
since she was little.
A few years ago we got called
to woodman house
the children's home.
One of their boys,
a ten year old, Michael flowers
he'd been reported missing and..
His mates, Chloe and Danny,
got it into their heads that
this old lady, Mary aminov,
had something to do with it..
And they hounded her.
Kept knocking on her door,
night after night
until in the end..
She couldn't take it any more.
She killed herself.
By the time we found the body,
the foxes had got to it.
It was a nasty business.
-Um, did you ever find out
if she took Chloe's friend,
Michael?
- There wasn't any evidence,
but..
99% of the time
when something bad does happen
to a child,
it's down to someone they know.
- You said you believed us.
- And I investigated.
Thoroughly.
Now, ahem.
When was the last time
that you saw Danny?
-We knocked on ginger's door.
She took him,
and now she's coming for me.
-Chloe..
The one thing that we can be
really certain of
is that old lady aminov
is not back from the dead.
-Chloe.
- Must be very difficult
bringing up a child on your own.
- My husband will be back
in a few days.
-Okay. Stay in touch.
-Will do.
Hey. It's just foxes.
We get them around here.
What are you looking at?
-You need to see this.
Baba yaga,
it's eastern European, I think
but it means different things,
evil hag, dark mother.
She's the most
ancient kind of demon.
She opens a doorway between
hell and the world of men
so that she can devour
the innocent.
Like my friend, Michael.
The demon's powers are limited
so she needs the help
from a human slave
or... or a cursed soul to help
do her bidding here on earth.
And you can tell
who the human slave is
because the demon marks them.
Look.
I bet Mary had that mark.
When you knock, the first
knock raises the demon
the second
summons the human slave
and the only way that
the human slave can be free
of the demon
is if they kill themselves
or if they trick someone else
into replacing them
by forcing them to do
something truly, truly evil.
-Enough.
- I thought
you wanted to help me.
- I do, sweetie,
but this is insane.
What is it?
-Doesn't matter.
-Yes, it does. Come here.
Come here.
Okay.
Um..
We are gonna work
with some Clay.
Here.
Warm it up in your hands.
We're just gonna put it around.
Like this.
Doesn't have to be pretty.
Cover the whole thing.
Fingers too.
See? Fun.
- Do you remember when you
and your friends had that party
and you painted all those crazy
animals on my wall?
-Um..
Yeah, yeah, I do.
You must have been, like five?
Maybe?
- There was that turtle
above my bed
the big green one
looking down on me
I loved that thing.
-That's right.
- That horrible bear
you painted behind the door.
It used to scare me so much.
- I... I don't remember
doing that.
- Probably 'cause you were high.
You were though, weren't you?
-I was, I was sick.
I hate that word, but, uh,
but it's the truth.
And..
When it got..
Really bad, I just..
I figured that
you were safer with..
Someone else lookin' after you.
-Well, I wasn't.
Forget it.
- I tried to get you back
sooner, I... I really did.
They just,
they... they wouldn't let me.
Maybe they were right,
maybe I... I wasn't
I wasn't ready back then, but..
I'm ready now.
God, I could use a drink.
But we are a, uh..
Soft drink only family now, so..
Uh, we've got diet and regular
I'm sure juice, soda water
um, and let's see.
Uh, regular good?
You really shouldn't move them
like that.
They're so fragile.
I'm sorry.
I am not angry at you.
-I thought I was safe here.
-You are.
Chloe!
- Thanks for the tour.
It's an incredible house.
-Thank you.
Do you mind if I check on Chloe?
We had a big delivery
for the studio.
-No, no problem.
Hello, Chloe.
-Hi.
There's just one more box.
-Okay.
-She's been really helpful.
Okay. The studio's this way.
- Jesus.
- No.
What?
Did you do this?
-No.
-What is wrong with you?
- You know, I'm gonna
have to put that
in my assessment, don't you?
If you feel unable to cope.
Chloe can always
come back to us.
You've got my number.
Okay?
- Hello, woodman house
child services?
Hello? Is anyone there?
Listen, whoever this is,
I can hear that you're upset.
Just know that you can
speak to me in confidence
and I'll do my best to help you.
Are you still there?
Hello?
- Chloe?
What are you doing?
-Leaving.
-Why?
- 'Cause you're gonna
send me back, aren't you?
Dump me?
Isn't that what you do?
- Do you know the scariest part
about having a baby?
It's not the pain
or the sleepless nights
it's not even doing it alone..
It's the love.
Nobody prepares you for that.
It's like, uh..
This wave that crashes into
you and pulls you out
to sea, you can't..
You can't fight it.
It's too strong.
I loved you from
the moment I saw you.
I loved you
when you were crying.
I loved you when I was high.
I loved you when I..
I loved you when I gave you up.
I loved you when I was..
Thousands of miles away.
And I love you now.
No matter what happens..
Nothing will ever change that.
-It wasn't me.
-Okay.
-Jess?
Jess?
Jess?
Jess?
Jess?
- Run.
-Jess?
Jess?
-Run!
-Jess, please!
Jess! Help. Help!
Don't, she's in there!
- Chloe,
there's no one in there.
Sweetheart, there's no one
in there. Okay?
Okay.
Shh.
Okay.
I've got you. Shh.
Hey.
I got an idea, alright?
I might need your help.
Okay.
-Did you grab my passport?
-Yes.
- Uh, we're gonna be
super early, though, so.
-Jess.
Help!
-Chloe, Chloe!
Come on, no!
-Jess?
Jess, please!
- Chloe, no!
- Help!
God, no!
- You finally covered up
dad's initials.
Good choice.
What are we gonna do?
- We're gonna find someone
who can help.
Okay?
Okay.
- I'm so sorry, Jess,
I want to help.
I have my own daughter
to think about.
- Just tell us what
we're dealing with, that's all.
You said that Chloe belongs
to someone else, what did..
Did you mean this?
-No. This is not right.
Don't believe everything
you read on the Internet.
It's not a baba yaga
haunting you.
-Then what is it?
- Mary was accused of a
terrible crime she didn't commit
and driven to suicide.
Chloe helped spread that lie
and now Mary wants revenge.
Jess, so far your love
for Chloe has protected her.
-It's my fault.
-No, it's not. Don't say that.
-Hi.
-Hey! Stay away from her!
I don't want you near my baby.
-Okay. Okay.
Tira, how do I stop this?
- Jess, there is only one way
to save your daughter.
- How?
- By clearing Mary's name.
If she didn't take that boy,
then find out who did.
And if you listen hard enough,
perhaps she will guide you.
-What do you think?
Chloe?
Chloe!
That missing boy Michael..
Were there ever any other
suspects besides Mary?
- Not as I recall.
Chances are he just ran away.
- But Chloe said that
you believed her
about Mary taking Michael,
what changed your mind?
- I didn't say
I changed my mind.
We closed the case, that's all.
Jess.
- And if you listen hard enough
perhaps she will guide you.
- "Michael flowers."
- That Michael flowers,
he's not the first, is he?
What about her?
Or her? Or him?
Tell me!
What do you think
will happen to you
when people find out
what you did?
I will make sure
that everybody does.
- We're here to discuss
what happens next.
-What do you mean?
- Chloe was very upset
when detective boardman
returned her to us this morning.
He's raised
some serious concerns
about your relationship
with her.
-Just trying to protect her.
She needs me.
- She spent last night
alone on the streets.
She believes that
witches are conspiring
to feed her to a demon.
How exactly is exposing her
to this kind of nonsense
protecting her?
- Have you asked Chloe
what she wants?
-Jess, are you using again?
- No. -Then would it be alright
with you to provide a sample?
-Sure. You got a cup?
- You're showing
some aggression.
-Oh, you have no idea.
No fucking idea.
I am just trying to protect her,
okay?
She's my daughter. She's mine.
Goddamnit!
- There will have to be
a full review
but it's only fair to warn you
that in light of what's happened
it is very likely your contact
with Chloe will be restricted.
She's a traumatized,
vulnerable young woman
who needs a stable environment.
Perhaps you should
consider counseling
for your own issues before
reapplying for custody.
- Michael flowers.
- Sorry?
- Is this detective boardman?
- What?
-Is this detective boardman?
- Yes. He's volunteered
here for years.
The kids love him.
- But 99% of the time
when something bad
does happen to a child.
- Jess, we're not finished.
- It's down to someone
they know.
-Chloe. Come on.
Shit.
- This way.
- Jess, I don't think
i can help her.
- Please, tira,
we don't have anyone else.
- Okay. I'll see
what I can do.
- Okay.
- Meet me back in the park.
I don't live far from there.
Thanks for coming back for me.
-Chloe!
Chloe! Chloe!
Shit.
Chloe?
Chloe, is that you?
- Yeah, I've got her,
she's down here.
- No, I need more time.
I need more time.
You didn't give me enough time.
I can bring you what you need.
I just need more time.
- You are trespassing.
- Come with us.
- I don't know what to do!
- Come outside. Don't resist.
-Wait. Ow, ow, ow, wait.
- Just stay with her.
I'll be back.
- You're expecting someone else?
This little reformed character
act you've got going
it's paper thin, isn't it?
Scratch the surface
and you're still
the same selfish piece of shit
that abandoned your kid
as soon as she got
in the way of your career.
-You don't know me.
-No. You don't understand.
You fucked up that poor
little girl's life once.
And I am not gonna let you
fuck it up again.
Now, where did you take Chloe?
What did you do with her?
Where is she?
- She took her.
- Who?
-Mary aminov.
Ginger.
- What?
- I thought I could protect her.
But once you knock,
she doesn't stop.
She just keeps coming.
-Oh, enough!
Tell me the truth.
-You didn't tell me the truth.
You said that the kids
hounded that woman.
But it was you.
You blamed her for the killings.
You kept at her until
she couldn't take it any more.
-She killed herself.
She got what she deserved.
-Did she? Did she really?
It's usually down
to someone they know.
That's what you told me.
- So?
- So, you knew them
better than she did.
You knew Michael,
you knew all the kids.
Why were you so determined
to point the finger at Mary?
Was she an easy scapegoat?
Why were there
never any other suspects?
How did it happen?
How does something
like that happen?
Did you see him out
on the street that night?
Did you offer
to give him a ride home?
How many others have you taken?
-We'll talk again later.
-Come on.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Chloe? Chloe.
- Jess.
Jess.
This way.
Chloe?
Hello?
Wait. Wait!
Wait.
Hello?
Chloe?
Ah!
- Michael.
- Help! Help!
Get away!
No!
-Jess!
- Hi. I'm gonna get you
out of here, okay?
-It's coming.
Let's go!
- Help!
Help us!
Come on!
Run.
- No!
Come on!
- Wait!
Help me. Help me.
- Come on.
Come on, we gotta go. Come on.
-What the fuck?
Jess?
Jess!
What are you doing?
Where's Jess?
I'm calling the police.
-Ben?
So, Chloe and I are home.
Um, we're safe. So, come back.
Okay. Bye. Love you.
You okay?
-Just thinking about boardman.
-He did some very bad things.
He had it coming.
- What do you mean?
What did he do?
-Your friend, Michael boardman
is the one who really took him.
He made everyone think
that it was Mary
so they wouldn't suspect him.
He got what he deserved.
-Boardman didn't take Michael.
He was a good man.
He always protected us.
- How are you?
You being taken care of?
- He's volunteered
here for years.
The kids love him.
-What are you talking about?
-I saw Michael.
Mary fed him to the demon.
Boardman was the only one
who believed us.
- And I investigated.
Thoroughly.
Everybody knows what you did.
She killed herself.
-No!
- She got what she deserved.
- And the only way
that the human slave
can be free of the demon
is if they kill themselves.
Or if they trick someone else
into replacing them
by forcing them to do something
truly, truly evil.
- Mary was the demon's slave.
She killed herself to be free.
Tira lied to me.
- It's not a baba yaga
haunting you.
-She tricked me.
- If she didn't take that boy,
then find out who did.
- She made me believe that
boardman was guilty.
Shit!
