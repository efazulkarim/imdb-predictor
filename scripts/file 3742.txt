"Through me you pass 
into the city of woe. 
"Through me you pass 
into eternal pain. 
"Through me among the 
people lost for aye. 
"Justice the founder 
of my fabric moved 
"To rear me was the task 
of Power divine, 
"Supreme Wisdom, 
and primeval Love. 
"Before me things 
create were none, 
"save things Eternal 
"and eternal I endure. 
"Abandon all hope all ye 
"who enter here." 
And now you've listened 
to that powerful reading, 
can anyone tell me 
why Dante's Inferno 
is still so important today? 
Am I to abandon all hope? 
Lawrence. 
Because he imagined hell. 
Yeah. 
Yeah, because he imagined hell. He shared with us a version of man's experience and 
relationship to existence 
to his sins, to his own mortality. I mean, you all come here, 
ladies and gentlemen 
to get lost in the classics and be inspired by the great masters but also to begin and to 
try to make sense of your own 
descent into hell. 
So, instead of the usual critical analysis of Dante's Inferno, 
I would like you 
to provide me with an 
Page 2/39
alternative poetic proposal 
to Dante's Hell. 
Your own. 
Your struggles, 
your fears, your sins 
whatever they may be. 
Oh, and uh... 
I want it by Monday. 
Yeah, good weekend. 
All right. 
Thanks. 
-Did you enjoy it? 
-Yes. 
Oh, really? 
Oh, hello, Susan. Thanks. 
Aren't you the hippest 
professor of them all? 
Darling, I would never dare 
take that title away from you. Well, I didn't just publish a book. That obviously helped. 
Don't worry, by this time next week, they would have forgotten all about it. There's a rectoral dinner 
at my place tonight. 
Select professors only. 
Please come. 
Ah, I'm afraid I can't tonight. I have plans. 
-Plans? 
-Mm-hmm. 
I imagine they're not staying 
at home correcting exams. 
Not exactly. 
-Have a good weekend. 
-You too. 
Do you mind giving me 
a lift, Professor? 
-Are you sleeping? 
-Mmm. 
Why do you smell so good? 
I'd like to stay like this 
forever. 
Not move, just stay here. 
Page 3/39
I don't think my publisher 
would be too happy about that. He has other writers, 
he'll get over it. 
You'll have to give up 
going to university. 
-Mm, I wouldn't mind. 
-You wouldn't mind? 
No. 
We'll never be able 
to make love again. 
If it's only for that, we'll move. How long have we been together? I don't know, um, almost a year? Thirteen months. 
-Thirteen months? 
-Mmm. 
And no one knows. 
So? 
Do you love me, Samuel? 
What sort of question is that? -Don't laugh, I'm being serious. -Well... 
I mean it. 
If you loved me, you wouldn't be hiding from everyone all the time. No. 
But then the entire university would be gossiping about us. 
Is that what you want? 
Just, I don't want 
this ever to end. 
Neither do I. 
Then promise me. 
You'll love me forever. 
Okay. 
Say it. 
I promise. 
Not like that, say it. 
I promise. 
I will love you forever. 
Bye. 
Oh, hello. 
Hello. 
Page 4/39
You hungry? 
You still love me, don't you? 
I waited by the chapel door 
But you were not inside 
The bells began their pealing 
In the silence 
Sorry, you know... 
The rain began to spatter 
Baby, um 
we've run out of cat food, so 
I'm gonna have to pop out. 
What do you say, I pick up 
some takeaway on my way back? 
No, no. 
Oh, my God, what have you done? Beatriz? Beatriz, come on! 
Hold on, hold on, hold on! 
Hold on! 
What have you done? Shit! 
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! 
Baby, come on. 
No! 
Come on! 
Come on! 
Come on! 
No! 
Here you go. 
Empty. 
I know, but this is the reference, that's what I'm saying. 
I missed it, perhaps, ma'am. 
You think you can manage? 
Yeah, sure, I'll catch you later. Hey. 
Here I was thinking I would never see you around here again. 
Well, I'm sure there 
are some people... 
who'd be delighted 
if that were the case. 
I don't think that's true. 
How are you? 
Does that offer for 
dinner still stand? 
Page 5/39
Of course. 
That little girl 
of five foot two 
Amazing things 
that she could do 
It sounds creepy. 
How long have you 
been having them? 
Every night 
for the past... three weeks. 
Are you seeing anyone 
to help you with this? 
First, I had a 
a grief counselor but I decided that wasn't really for me. 
I'm sure it has 
occurred to you that 
these dreams might have 
something to do with 
what happened. 
The woman in my dreams 
looks nothing like Beatriz. 
No, what I mean is like, y-your head is trying to get rid of 
the pain that's inside you, 
like, you know, therapy. 
It's got nothing 
to do with that, okay? 
Have you written anything? 
I've got nothing to say. 
Pfff. 
Write about your dream. 
Oh, sure. I'll become 
a horror writer. 
What's wrong about that? 
Horror writers are sexy. 
Come on. 
Poets are starving, boring. 
Oh, on that note, 
I got that for your birthday 
and then you disappeared, so... better late than never. 
Happy birthday to you. 
Open it. 
Page 6/39
Now, that's what I call pressure. Come on, use it for 
your grocery list. 
Or to correct exams. 
You are a professor, remember? And a good one, so. 
Why don't you stop 
biting your nails? 
Fuck you. 
You miss me already? 
Are you at home? Samuel? 
Yeah, just got back. 
Switch on the TV. 
The local news channel. 
Quick. 
-Why? 
-Just do it. 
-Do it! 
-Okay, okay. 
Do you have it? 
Murder has shaken the quiet 
-Yeah. 
-sleepy suburb of Ballsbridge. A Garda spokesman has said 
that the badly beaten corpse 
was found on the second story 
surrounded by what appears to be a makeshift white circle on the floor. Garda believe the event has all the hallmarks of a ritual-type killing. Samuel? 
-Further forensic investigation -Samuel? 
to establish the exact course of events is currently underway. 
She was killed 
a couple of days ago. 
And apparently a 
cleaning lady found her 
when she arrived in the morning. Okay. 
She was an Italian lady 
and her name, uh... 
her name is Lidia Garetti 
Page 7/39
and this is the woman 
I saw in my dreams. 
This is her. I am positive. 
Samuel, do you realize 
how incredible this is? 
Yes. 
You dreamt about something that was going to happen before it did. Before it did. 
That's called a 
premonitory dream. 
But why me? Why? 
-I-I don't even know this woman. -I don't know. 
There has to be an explanation. We'll figure it out. 
No, we will not. 
This is not one of your 
esoteric adventures. 
This woman is dead. 
This is real. 
And I saw how it happened. 
Really? What are you gonna do? Who are you going to talk to 
the police? 
What are you going to say? 
"Hi, inspector, um... 
"I know what happened to the 
Italian woman in Ballsbridge. 
"I wasn't there, but 
I saw it in my dream." 
Do you realize what 
that looks like? 
It's crazy. 
Wait! 
Wait! 
Stop! 
-No! 
-Stop! 
No! Please don't hurt me! 
Please don't hurt me. 
I'm not gonna hurt you. 
I'm not gonna hurt you. 
Just tell me what 
Page 8/39
you're doing here. 
Are y-you a policeman? 
No, no, I'm... I'm... 
Wait, who are you? 
Were you stealing? 
No. 
No, I... 
I saw what happened 
to that...woman on TV. 
Did you know her? 
No. No, no. 
Then why? 
What about you? 
If you're not with 
the police, then... 
I just know it. 
You dreamt about it 
too, didn't you? 
You have to see something. 
Follow me. 
Jesus Christ. 
Notice anything different? 
I realized as soon as I came in. Something was missing. 
-There. 
-Yes. 
Those shelves. 
There was a... 
-There was a door. 
-Exactly. 
Be careful. 
Oh, shit. 
It's the battery. 
-I've got some matches. 
-Yeah? 
-Here you go. 
-Thanks. 
Oh, Christ. 
Why on earth would you 
keep an aquarium up here? 
Don't know. 
There's... 
There's something in there. 
What is that? 
Page 9/39
Let's find out. 
Some kind of inscription on it. "You see the beast that 
made me turn aside" 
That's... that's Dante. 
Yeah, that's right. 
Whoever killed her was 
looking for something. 
You saw the house. 
This could be what they're after. But she wanted us to find it. 
That's why we had 
the same dream. 
Think about it. 
Shit. 
Let's go. 
Hurry! 
Hey! 
Stop there! 
Stop! 
Stop! 
Tomorrow at 7: 
There's a waiting list. 
The White Ring was some 
sort of experimental 
literary circle that 
used to meet there. 
And it seems some of 
their concerns were too 
esoteric to be taken seriously. Shakespeare. 
The impossible sonnets. 
Nobody's ever been able 
to decipher them. 
-Including Shakespeare himself. -Mm-hmm. 
He says they've been dictated 
to him in his dreams 
-by a dark lady. 
-Mm-hmm. 
Milton... my specialty. 
He tells of his experience 
of meeting a lady 
Page 10/39
by the name of Herberia on 
the outskirts of Florence. 
Mm. 
According to him, she was the 
inspiration for Paradise Lost. Keats, Blake, the 
references are endless. 
They all hint at having had 
some contact with the muses. 
-Number one invites. 
-Mm-hmm. 
Number two invokes. 
Number three lies. 
Number four punishes. 
Number five foretells. 
Number six impassions. 
Number seven hides. 
The seven ladies. 
Yeah, the mystery of the muses. Is there more? 
Well, your friends through the White Ring took the subject too far. For years they published 
their theories 
in all sorts of 
specialized magazines. 
First, in academic 
circles, then in 
marginal occult publications. 
And in all of them, they 
claim that they met them. 
What is this? 
Poetic inspiration taken from 
nature in the form of a woman. Supernatural beings 
of inconceivable evil. 
Immortal witches 
invoking poetry 
through the use of spells. 
Okay. 
Well, do you think 
we can find these guys? 
I could call Berkeley 
through the department 
Page 11/39
but I'm kind of getting 
tired of being a secretary. 
You went to that house 
without telling me. 
You found a treasure in 
some kind of aquarium and 
suddenly a girl showed up 
out of nowhere and took it. 
If I had been there, that 
would not have happened. 
So, are you gonna help me 
find these guys or what? 
Mom! 
What's that? 
Nothing. Just something I found. Are you annoyed? 
What? 
I don't know, you seem weird. 
What do you mean? 
No, baby, I'm just... 
pfff, I'm just tired, is all. 
You going to work tonight? 
Just for a little while. 
But I'll be back soon. 
I promise. 
And you know what? 
What? 
Tonight's my last night. 
I'm not going back there again. Really? 
Ever! 
He's in go noogie wig! 
There's uh, five of them. 
Lee Barlow, Matthew Osmen, Lawrence Colbert, Barry Sutton, Herbert Rauschen. Great. Um, can we reach them? 
Wait. 
Lee Barlow stabbed 
himself six years ago. 
28 times to be precise 
in front of his family. 
Matthew Osmen, a strange 
degenerative disease 
that rots the tissue until the 
Page 12/39
victim collapses to death. 
Doctors still don't understand. Barry Sutton was found 
dead on a Portland dock. 
He had been devoured from the 
inside by an unidentified insect. The interesting detail is 
they found a verse by Baudelaire scratched onto his body by a knife. Lawrence Colbert went mad. 
He stabbed several children 
who were on their way 
home at the school gates. 
The police shot him down. 
And you know what? 
They also found verses 
tattooed on his back. 
So, it looks like we 
have no witnesses left. 
That's it. 
No, no, no, no, wait. 
You said there... 
What about Herbert Rauschen? 
Berkeley doesn't have 
any records of him. 
In fact, they didn't 
even recognize his name. 
Do what you're told. 
Hey, Rachel, 
what a nice surprise. 
I heard you were late. 
Again. 
I'm sorry. I'm not 
feeling too great. 
Ah. That's a shame. 
Neither am I. 
Would you look at this. 
Look at this, this crap 
I have to take. Hmm? 
Yeah. 
But I'm never late, am I? 
No. 
You said that when 
I got to 100 grand 
Page 13/39
you'd give it back to me. 
That's the last of it. 
And what am I gonna tell the people that brought you here, Rachel, huh? You don't know them. 
They're... 
They're bad news. 
Hmm? 
Hmm? 
You wanna leave us? 
You? Queen of the whores? 
After all we've been 
through together. 
Don't we take good care of you? You do. 
We treat you well? 
-You do. 
-Hmm? 
Don't be late again, Rachel. 
Ever. 
No, no, no, no. 
Shh, shh, shh, shh... 
And you're mistaken. 
It's 150 grand you owe me. 
That's the deal. 
Have you found anything? 
There. 
That's no surprise. 
Dunquin. 
That's here, right? 
There's a Dunquin in 
County Kerry. 
Can you still access the 
Irish university's database? 
He's dead, Samuel. 
They all are. 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, 
but see for yourself. 
They never found a body. 
We need to look to see if he had any link with the university here. Doctorates, conferences, 
PhDs, anything. 
We need to see if we can get 
Page 14/39
a location on him, uh... 
find an address 
for him living here. 
You better wait after me. 
I love you. 
Dino, come get it! 
Come get it. 
Dino? 
Dino? 
Dino? 
Dino? 
How the fuck did you 
get into my home? 
Through the drain pipe. 
I can do incredible things. 
You better get out 
before I call the police. 
We want the imago. 
What you found in the aquarium. It belongs to us. 
Who the hell are you? 
You took it out of the water. 
You have to be the one 
who gives it back. 
Those are the rules. 
Get out. 
What the fuck have 
you done with-- 
I'll touch 
to where possible 
after a long grief 
and pain. 
Tomorrow 
before midnight 
25 miles along the 
road to the north 
in Joy Hill 
come out 
with the imago. 
Samuel? 
-Sam? 
-Shit. 
Sam? 
Samuel? 
Page 15/39
-Open the door. 
-All right, all right. 
-Just a sec. I'm coming! 
-Sam? 
-What's your problem? 
-Sorry, sorry. 
Are you okay? 
Do you need help? 
Yeah, I'm just gonna... 
gonna clean it up. 
Did you find anything? 
You know, you were right. 
In the mid 80s, Rauschen left his chair at Brown to come to Europe. Did various rotations 
at English universities 
and then he ended 
up here in Cork. 
Well, have you got an address 
from the file in Cork? 
No, they say he lived on campus. There was an address in Dunquin which he canceled 
right before he quit. 
What does it sound like to you? Sounds to me like 
someone who's hiding. 
Who's running scared. 
Have you got the address? 
-You better let me drive. 
-No, no, no, no. 
-No, I'm going alone. 
-What? 
-Susan... 
-I thought we were in this together. Susan! 
Look at all this. Do you think this is all a coincidence? 
People who get close 
to this get hurt! 
-I mean it! It's over. 
-Okay. 
You scare me right now. 
Just do as I say, okay? 
Page 16/39
Good morning. 
My name's Samuel Salomon. 
I'm from the university. 
And I was hoping to... 
speak with Professor Rauschen. The professor died. 
I know. 
Tell him it's about 
the White Ring. 
Come in. 
My name is Samuel Salomon. 
I need to talk to you. 
About Lidia. 
Lidia Garetti. 
How did you find me? 
I found this photo 
from her house. 
Lidia is dead. 
She was murdered 
three days ago. 
What is it you want? 
I want you to tell me 
what you know. 
About her. 
About the White Ring. 
The fake shipwreck. 
What are you hiding from? 
Seven ladies there are. 
That's what you came here 
to talk about, isn't it? 
We spent years finding this. 
It was an obsession. 
What is that? 
Lidia recorded this moment. 
Just a little... demonstration. A demonstration of what? 
Of what they are. 
Wait a second. 
Are you suggesting that... 
-That Lidia... 
-Yes, Mr. Salomon. 
She who foretells. 
"Thus much and more 
"And yet thou lov'st me not 
Page 17/39
"And never wilt 
"Love dwells not in our will 
"Nor can I blame thee, 
though it be my lot 
"To strongly, wrongly, 
vainly, love thee still" 
What the fuck is that? 
It's what they do. 
Muses play with words. 
And they use poets to infiltrate our world. 
The inspiration. 
These verses seem as beautiful as any other, don't they? 
But they're traps. 
What is that? 
It looks harmless, doesn't it? But it kills 
everything I love. 
Friends. 
A child. 
And then another child. 
And then another. 
Everything. 
Lidia is not your problem. 
It's the other ones 
you have to worry about. 
Give them what they want 
as soon as possible. 
Do as I say. 
I can't. 
I don't have what they want. 
Then... 
Run. 
Mom, this one is the biggest, 
hardest, and most massive object... Pack your things. 
-We have to go. 
-Where? 
I don't know. We'll see. 
But why? This is our home. 
No, baby, it's not. 
Please hurry. 
Excuse me. 
Page 18/39
How you doing? 
-I um... 
-Hey. 
We're closed. 
Yeah, hi, uh... 
I'm wondering if you can help me. I'm looking for a girl. 
Get out. 
I don't want any trouble. I just need to know where I can find... What's your problem? 
It's okay, it's okay. 
-Who the fuck are you? 
-I'm just looking for a girl. 
I think she works here. 
Dark hair, green eyes, 
Eastern European accent. 
Rachel, of course. 
Rachel? 
You think you're the first one to come looking for her? 
I don't know how she makes you all lose your fucking minds. 
No, no, no, no. 
I've never been here before. 
I met her a couple of days ago. We... 
Look, I really need to know 
where to find her. 
I need to talk to her. 
Please, it's important. 
You're the guy with the dreams. Have... 
She told you about me? 
Look, she's in danger. 
I just want to try and help her. Please. 
All right. 
She lives in one of the apartment blocks in St. Teresa's Garden. I think it's the last one. 
That's all I know. 
Thank you. 
-What are you doing? 
Page 19/39
-Packing. 
I meant your clothes, 
put your clothes in. 
But I can't leave 
my stuff here, Mom. 
I'll buy you other toys, I promise. But I don't want other toys. 
Just pick one. 
Your favorite, yeah? 
This one? 
No, that's too big. 
This one, please? 
No, baby, that's even bigger. 
Put this on. 
You ready? 
Come on. 
Shh. 
Hello, Rachel. 
Have you forgotten who 
got you this shithole? 
Go to the bedroom. 
Now! Now! Go! 
Very obedient, isn't he? 
Didn't get that from you. 
What do you want? 
I was looking for your passport. I wanted to um, I wanted 
to keep to my word. 
But you know what? 
I couldn't find it. 
Please don't hurt us, 
don't hurt my son. 
Darling, what do you 
take me for, huh? 
What do you take me for? 
Tonight, I-I come in peace. 
Tonight, 
you come by the club, 
we have a few drinks, 
boogie woogie... 
It's all forgotten about. 
Yeah? Hmm? 
First, Rachel, you and I, 
we're gonna have a 
Page 20/39
we're gonna have a 
little talk, yeah? 
So we can straighten things out. Please! 
Please, please, no! 
Fucking figure out how 
things work around here. 
Hey, boys. 
I'm looking for a girl. 
She's got short dark hair, 
she's very pretty. 
Are you a cop? 
Do you know her? 
You'll do as you're told, Rachel. You'll fuck whenever I tell ya or else your son's 
gonna get hurt. 
And you don't want that, do ya? Do ya?! 
You know now? 
You're giving me too 
much trouble, Rachel. 
And I don't want any trouble. 
Do you understand? 
Do you understand? 
Do you understand? 
-I und... 
-Get in there! 
Rachel? 
It's Samuel, the guy you 
met at Garetti's house. 
Rachel? 
Rachel, I know you're in there. Mom? 
Rachel, I heard you. 
I know you're in there, Rachel. Rachel? 
He tried to kill us. 
What? 
Help us. 
Help us. 
Are you a policeman? 
No. 
You're not the first 
Page 21/39
person to ask me that. 
You think I look 
like a policeman? 
Mmm, not really. 
Do you know what I want 
to be when I grow up? 
No, what? 
A-An astronaut. 
Well, or an astronomer. 
To go to Jupiter... 
on an expedition. 
Did you know that they've never sent anyone to explore it? 
Well, maybe they're 
waiting to send you. 
So you can be the first. 
Come on, buddy. 
Time for bed. 
Is he asleep? 
Yeah. 
Thank you. 
-Listen, that man... 
-I don't want to know. 
I don't know who 
you are, Rachel. 
And it's fine. 
I just want this. 
And I've got it. 
But you helped us. 
You could've called the police. You could've... 
taken that and just left but 
you brought us here. 
You're a good man. 
I'm a scared man. 
That's what I am. 
And a little sad. 
Why is that so important? 
All I know is that 
there's someone 
willing to do anything 
to get it back. 
The people who killed Lidia. 
Doesn't matter. 
Page 22/39
That woman wanted us to find it. I'm certain of it. 
She wanted us to find it, great. We found it. 
And now I'm gonna give it back. End of story. 
And then what? 
I killed a man. 
They're gonna come after me. 
Then leave. 
I can't. 
I have nothing. 
I have nowhere to go. 
You have your son. 
You can still change your life. What about you? 
It's time. 
You're not coming back. 
Are you? 
Stay here. 
And don't open the door 
to anyone. 
-Hello? 
-Mr. Salomon, this is Rauschen. There's something 
I didn't tell you. 
Lidia sent me a letter 
some months ago. 
I hadn't heard from her in 
years, so I was scared. 
I thought there would be 
something evil in her words. 
Uh, Professor, I appreciate 
you calling me, but... 
You don't understand. 
I think Lidia knew 
you were coming to see me. 
I think the letter was for you. Professor, listen, it's over... Hello again, Professor. 
Pro-- 
Mr. Salomon. 
Such a horrible day. 
Welcome, Mr. Salomon. 
Page 23/39
We were expecting you. 
Who are you? 
She who invokes. 
Some people call me Herberia 
but it's a bit 
pretentious, don't you think? 
You can call me Jaqueline. 
It's a French name. 
Do you like it? 
No. 
You're an insolent man. 
That does not befit a poet. 
I am not a poet. 
One who gave up writing. 
What a waste. 
If you only knew what 
you were missing. 
There's a line by Cavafy 
that can produce 
blisters filled with pus 
and a high fever. 
And a very brief Neruda that 
explodes like a nuclear plant. Boom! 
Poetry can do incredible things. I didn't come here 
to see party tricks. 
No, of course not. 
We have matters to 
deal with, do we not? 
First, you have to 
give me your word. 
You will not harm us. 
You have your own conditions? 
You should stop drinking 
whiskey, Mr. Salomon. 
The girl and the child. No one. If I give you what you want, 
you forget about us 
forever. 
I want to see it. 
Promise... 
and I'll give it to you. 
I promise. 
Page 24/39
This is not the imago. 
Just a shell. 
Did you by any chance come 
here to trick us, Mr. Salomon? Well, someone did. It's obvious. It seems that girl of yours 
is not to be trusted. 
Bring us the imago, Mr. Salomon. But do not expect mercy now. 
Samuel? 
Rachel, open the door. 
Who is it? 
You know who I am. 
Please open the door, 
they can't see me here. 
Lidia. 
You started to remember. 
No, but... 
No, that's impossible. 
I saw you die. 
They had to believe that. 
Why? 
You still don't remember, 
but you will. 
My baby? 
No. No. 
No, it wasn't 
because of your baby. 
That was an excuse. 
It was because of you. 
You-You're different. 
You've always been different. 
You can feel things. 
They'll never 
be able to feel. 
That's why they envy you. 
What about you? 
I'm with you. 
We have a plan. 
That's why I'm here. 
Do you want to remember? 
We're so lucky that 
insignificant man came along. 
Samuel. 
Page 25/39
Jaqueline's puzzled. 
Doesn't understand what 
he has to do with any of it. 
You called him. 
With the dreams, 
like you called... me. 
Yes. Right. 
How forgetful of me. 
Who are you? 
Gotcha. 
Don't you remember me? 
She who lies. 
You can tell 
I'm out of practice. 
What do you want? 
You know exactly what I want. 
You can't have it. 
You can't take it from me. 
I remember the rules. 
Of course. The rules. 
The ones you don't follow. 
But that's not why I'm here. 
Mom? 
Go back to bed, buddy. 
Six. Where's the six? 
She...who punishes. 
I've been expecting you 
for a long time. 
Secrets must be kept, Professor. You should have 
learned that by now. 
Don't exert yourself. 
That's Yates. 
It won't let you move. 
Don't be afraid. 
This one is very short. 
But it's going to keep 
you alive for hours. 
We didn't want you to 
miss out on anything. 
What the fuck? 
Six. 
What did you do? 
What the fuck did you do? 
Page 26/39
They took my son. 
What? 
I just wanted that thing. 
-Why didn't you give it to me? -Couldn't. 
I remembered. 
What are you talking about? 
Remembered what? 
What I am. 
My imago. 
Every lady has one. 
It's our power. 
Our memory. 
This is eternity. 
Without it, we're just 
pieces of flesh. 
I've seen them. 
And you're not like that. 
That's why they hate me. 
They hate everything 
that seems human 
because they'll never 
be able to have it. 
But I can love. 
They've been looking for a chance to banish me for centuries-- 
any excuse. 
Then it happened. 
There are rules. 
There are hundreds of rules. 
A lady cannot bear children. 
It's forbidden. 
That gave them a reason. 
They could have 
just destroyed it 
and let me to die like 
any human, but no. 
They wanted more. 
They buried it 
and they voided it. 
I lost my power. 
I forgot everything. 
And then they 
sold me to that man. 
Page 27/39
But my eternity would 
remain intact. 
So the punishment 
would never end. 
Then Lidia got it back. 
She was different too, 
in her own way. 
She always wanted to help me. 
They must've found out somehow and that's why they killed her. That can't be. 
There is a way. 
A ritual. 
The White Ring. 
Lidia could see the future. 
She's been guiding us 
from the beginning. 
But why me? 
Maybe she thought 
I needed help. 
She would never have chosen me. I would have chosen you. 
"Nor want 
"Nor weakness 
"Still conspires 
"To bind us 
"To a sordid state" 
What are you? 
She who impassions. 
Give it to them. 
No. 
They've won. 
They'll do the same 
thing to you again. 
And they'll kill me, 
I'm sure of it. 
As long as we have the imago, 
they'll keep me alive. 
I took it, I have to give it back. Those are the rules. 
This is the only thing 
that's protecting us. 
What? 
Number Seven. 
Page 28/39
She who hides. 
Not even we have seen her. 
She's the cruelest, 
the most dangerous. 
But she's also the weakest. 
If she dies, they all die. 
That's why she hides. 
Where? 
The receptacle. 
Nobody knows what it is. 
Wait. 
Lidia. 
Maybe she knew. 
No, if she wanted to help us, 
she would have told us somehow. Maybe she did. 
Makes sense. 
Lidia knew they 
were watching her. 
That's why she was 
being so cryptic. 
That's why she sent the 
letter to Rauschen. 
And hid the photo in the frame. She knew it would 
lead you to him. 
You better stay here. 
Professor? 
Hello? 
Professor? 
Professor? 
Professor? 
Professor, is that you? 
Professor, the letter. 
Where is it? 
Professor? 
Now, listen, listen to me now... "My heart aches, 
"and a drowsy numbness pains" 
Do you think they know 
about the letter? 
No, they they would 
have taken it. 
A key? 
Page 29/39
"They are all gone into 
the world of light 
"And I alone sit lingring here 
"Their very memory 
is fair and bright, 
"And my sad thoughts 
doth clear." 
My sad thoughts doth clear. 
My sad thoughts doth clear. 
It's Milton. I'm sure of it. 
-It has to mean something. 
-I don't know. 
But I know someone who will. 
It's open. 
Oh, fuck. 
Susan? 
Susan? 
Oh, my God! 
Susan, stop that! 
Oh, fuck. 
Fucking hell, what 
have they done to you? 
When did they do this to you? 
Oh, my God! 
What are you doing? 
Dammit! Stop it! 
Stop it! 
Stop! 
What does it mean? 
She's gonna devour herself. 
Well, there must be some 
way we can stop it! 
There's nothing we can do. 
You stopped the nurse, 
maybe you can do it. 
I didn't stop the nurse. 
I killed him. 
Do you want me to do that now? Maybe we can cut it out! 
-What? 
-Go get a knife! 
I don't think that'll work. 
Down to the kitchen at 
the end of the hallway. 
Page 30/39
Bring whatever you can find. 
No! 
Susan, please, stop it! 
Stop it! 
Rachel! Hurry, please! 
Rachel! 
I can't. 
Help me put her on her back. 
Hold her hand, 
don't let her touch it. 
Take her hands, hold her hands. Are you sure about this? 
No! 
We're gonna have to 
tie her down. 
Stop her hurting herself. 
Find us something to tie... 
Tie her up. 
I'm not gonna hurt you, 
but I'm gonna have to stop you from doing this to yourself, all right? I'm so sorry... 
I got it, I got it! 
All right. 
-Turn her round. 
-Give me her hand. 
All right, that's good. 
Get it, get it. 
We're gonna get you onto the 
bed now, you'll be okay up there. All right, shh now... 
Here we go. 
Shh...shh... 
Okay. 
All right. 
Shh, shh, shh... 
Try to breathe. 
Breathe... 
Breathe. 
We have to call an ambulance. 
They'll take her to a hospital. They'll try to remove it. 
They won't. 
They don't know what it is. 
Page 31/39
As soon as she's free, 
she'll start doing it again 
and she won't stop. I'm sorry. What if they keep her safe? 
What if they sedate 
her or something? 
She can still help us. 
You have to show her the verse. They have my son. 
You have no idea what 
they're capable of. Please. 
Call an ambulance. 
Susan... 
I'm-I'm sorry to have to ask you this, but I need your help. 
I need you to tell me 
what this means. 
"They are all gone into 
the world of light 
"And I alone sit lingring here 
"Their very memory 
is fair and bright, 
"And my sad thoughts 
doth clear." 
It's Milton, isn't it? 
-You're the expert, you tell me... -No. 
No. 
Not Milton. 
What? 
Vaughan. 
People mistake that... 
The poem, Susan, 
what does it mean? 
-What does it...? 
-Let me go. 
-Let me go. 
-Susan, please. 
-I'm sorry. 
-Let me go. 
-Let me go. 
-I'm sorry. 
The poem, what does it mean? 
Beyond the veil. 
Page 32/39
Susan? 
They won't be long. 
What'd she tell you? 
Nothing. 
Beyond the veil, is the 
title of the poem? 
Why didn't she just 
write down an address? 
If she wanted to tell us. 
Wait, beyond the veil. 
She did. 
Bortrane Lunatic Asylum. 
Room 1007. 
This is the place. 
It's indelible ink. 
Lidia sent the letter from 
there six months ago. 
But it's been closed for years. We have to go. Now. 
No, no, no. We have to 
wait for the ambulance. 
We can't leave Susan like this. She's my friend. 
Then I'll wait outside. 
There's an ambulance 
on it's way. 
They'll be here any minute. 
Do you hear me, Susan? 
Everything will be 
just as before. 
I promise. 
I'll come back to the 
university like you wanted. 
I think I can help her. 
I'm remembering. 
How? 
I'm not sure but I can try. 
Leave me alone with her. 
Okay. 
Susan! 
Got you. 
I wouldn't go in there if 
I were you, Mr. Salomon. 
You won't like it. 
Page 33/39
No! 
I want to hurt them. 
I want them to fucking die. 
The receptacle. 
Whatever it is, 
it has to be in there. 
That's where she's hiding. 
We'll have to be ready. 
What happens when she dies? 
They all will. 
And you? 
My son will live. 
We have to hurry. 
Won't take them long to find us. Room 1007. 
-Seven. 
-Seven. 
Stand back here. 
There's nothing in here. 
It has to be. 
The message is clear. 
-What if you're wrong? 
-No. 
No, no, no, no. 
Promise. 
Will. 
Love. 
Forever. 
Promise you'll love forever. 
What's wrong? 
What is that? 
It's you. 
What is it? 
The receptacle. 
It's you. 
What? 
She's... 
She's inside you. 
Lidia knew it. 
You were the only piece 
out of place. 
Now everything fits. 
No. 
-Samuel. 
Page 34/39
-No. 
Samuel? 
Face it, Samuel. Tell me. 
Think about how you met her. 
How she appeared in your life. It was all part of a plan. 
Stop! 
She made you fall in love 
with here, didn't she? 
And then she left. 
Why? 
Because she knew...you'll 
never be able to forget her. 
You were the perfect 
hiding place. 
No! 
No! 
She's inside you, Samuel. 
She's in your heart. 
I want to get her 
out of my heart! 
I know how to do that. 
But you have to tell me 
how it happened. 
You have chosen well, Rachel. 
The saddest of all stages 
for the saddest of all endings. What is this place? 
It's here. 
It has to happen here. 
What is it? 
Lidia. 
What are you looking for? 
It's perfect. 
What are you doing? 
Help me. 
Tear this off. 
The White Ring. 
Come on. 
I'm gonna need you now. 
Follow me. 
What do you need me to do? 
We'll trick her. 
We have to smoke her out. 
Page 35/39
Yes. 
Take off your coat. 
If the receptacle is in danger... If your body is hurt... 
she'll be forced to come out. 
Give me your arm. 
We'll have to be quick. 
When she comes out, she'll 
sense that she's in danger 
and she'll turn violent. 
We have to put her in the circle. That will immobilize her. 
And that will be the moment. 
Samuel, 
youre gonna have to kill her. 
There's no other way. 
Oh, fuck. 
I don't want you to die. 
Promise me. 
You'll take care of my son. 
Always. 
Promise me you'll love him. 
Please. 
She's running. 
She's coming. 
She's coming. 
Samuel. 
You have to hang on. 
Please. 
Please, please please. 
Hang on, please. 
I have no wit, 
I have no words, 
I have no tears, 
No tears. 
Bring the boy. 
Samuel? 
Don't listen to her. 
Kill her. 
She's lying to you, Samuel. 
She has no idea what we were. 
Don't listen to her. 
Kill her. 
Look at me, Samuel. 
Page 36/39
It's me, Samuel. 
Don't you remember? 
Kill her. 
No, don't do it, no! 
Kill her. 
No, don't listen to her, please. Do it! 
My love. 
You're not Beatriz. 
-No, don't say that. 
-You are not Beatriz. 
She was alive. 
And my love, it's not that simple. I'm a lot of things 
at the same time. 
No. 
No, no, no, no, no. 
She's lying to you. 
She's lying to you. 
Kill her. 
Look at me. 
I could have chosen anyone. 
She's lying. 
But I chose you. 
Do you know why? 
Do it. Do it. Kill her. 
Because I loved you. 
No, no, no, no no. 
-You know it. 
-No. No. 
She's lying. Look at me. 
You promised. 
Do you remember, 
you promised me? 
You will love me forever. 
What? 
-What? 
-Kill her. 
Kill her! 
I must admit. 
I didn't think you'd 
get this far, Rachel. 
Mom? 
Oh, babe... 
Page 37/39
Please. 
Let him go. 
No, Rachel. 
The rules are different. 
You let her go 
and your son will 
live a little longer. 
We've come for the 
imago, remember? 
He will never give it to you. 
I don't think he'll 
have much choice. 
The end of this story 
has already been written. 
Give us the imago 
and we can turn the page. 
Mom! 
Mom! 
Accept your fate, Rachel. 
I have incredible plans for you. Samuel, don't do it. 
Shhh... 
You see? 
You can't do it. 
You won't want to leave your son alone 
in this mediocre world. 
That wouldn't be a good end 
for this story, would it? 
I can't think...of a better one. Kill her. 
Now. 
This is how that story ends. 
The saddest story of them all. And like all stories, 
one day, 
it will be forgotten. 
All that will remain 
will be a trace of black ink 
on a piece of paper. 
But I know it was real. 
I know she was real. 
Sam? 
And I know that one day, 
Page 38/39
we will find a way 
to bring her back. 
Poetry 
can do incredible things.
