(PHONE LINE RINGS) 
MAN: 
Pick up the phone. Pick up. 
Pick up. Pick up. 
Pick up. Pick up. Pick up. 
- Hey, it's Lucy. 
- Ah, hello, Lucy. 
- (RECORDING BEEPS) 
- Er, hello, answering machine. It's me, Tom. Remember? 
We met a couple of weeks ago. 
Think you were chatting 
me up at the bar. 
Yeah, so I was thinking 
there was this festival 
this weekend in Ireland 
that I'm going to, 
and I thought maybe... 
okay, I'll call later, actually. - (PHONE TONE RINGS) 
- (RECORDING BEEPS) 
Hey, it's Lucy. 
TOM: 
about this weekend, 
I didn't mean just you and I. 
It's not like a date or anything. It's... there's going to be, like, a whole bunch of us camping. 
So, yeah, bring some friends, 
if you have any, 
just in case we don't get along, which we would, if you came. 
(WATER TRICKLING) 
(OBJECTS CLATTER) 
(DOOR CREAKING) 
Hello? 
Quick. Quick. Let's get out of here. Here, close the door. 
That was a nice pub. 
I think I counted 12 men, 
seven dogs, 
Page 2/32
no women, and me. 
I thought since the festival 
doesn't start tonight, 
there's no bands playing, 
for a special treat... 
I've booked a hotel. 
- Ah. 
- Mm-hmm. 
- You cheeky fuck. 
- Ow. 
Fore... okay, we've started 
already foreplay. 
You said we were going up 
to the festival tonight. 
- That was the plan. 
- Yes... 
Now I have friends 
up there camping, 
thinking we're on our way. 
It's our two-week anniversary. Remember? 
Oh, you can't have 
a two-week anniversary. 
It's a nice hotel. 
Look in the glove box. 
I printed out some stuff 
from the website. 
Go on, look at it. 
"Your slice of paradise 
in the Emerald Isle." 
Mm-hmm. That's why I booked it. Forgot to say 
you look really nice today. 
(CHUCKLES) 
Okay. Let's go. 
You mean it? 
- Yeah. 
- Okay. 
We have to wait here until 7:00, and then someone's gonna come 
and show us the way. 
That's what I arranged. 
What if I said no? 
I thought I was being 
Page 3/32
vaguely romantic. 
(HORN HONKS) 
Ah. 
That's him? 
I guess so. 
All right, wait. Whew. 
LUCY: 
on the way to the toilet. 
Oh, yeah? 
Barman thought that I was 
a "strong, fine-looking 
young thing." 
That's a good line. 
What? You want me to go back? 
(CHUCKLES) 
You want me to go back 
and have words? 
I'll have a stern word 
in that man's ear. 
I'll take him outside, and I'll hit him right in the middle of the forehead. (LAUGHS) 
Well, whilst you were on the 
toilet, some guy bumped into me and spilt my drink all over me, on my new jumper. 
And then I ended up buying him and all his friends a drink. 
The whole pub? Why? 
Well, he bumped into me, 
spilt my drink on me, 
so I was like, "Excuse me," 
and he said it wasn't his fault, and I said, 
"Well, it wasn't my fault." 
And then it got a bit weird, 
and then he did offer 
to buy me a drink, 
but by that point, 
I was like, "Well, look, 
I'll buy you 
and your friends a drink," 
just to keep things calm. 
Page 4/32
'Cause I'm a lover. 
I'm not a fighter. 
What? 
(HORN HONKS) 
Oh, okay. 
LUCY: 
(SILENT) 
Tom, no! He could have seen you. - Oh. 
- Don't be rude like that. 
TOM: 
Do you want some help? 
Fine! 
(CHAINS CLINK) 
(WIND WHISTLING) 
Whoo! 
Yeah, yeah. Very funny, Lucy. 
Ugh. 
- Got dirty hands now. 
- Ugh. 
- Stay away. Ugh. 
- Huh? 
- Huh? Huh? 
- No. Ugh. 
Huh? Huh? 
(DISTANT HORN HONKING) 
TOM: 
They're the guys from the pub? Think so. 
(HONKING CONTINUES) 
- LUCY: 
- Fine. 
I don't know where I am, actually. Tom booked a hotel, 
so I'm not going 
to be there tonight. 
(CHUCKLES) 
I've talked with him. 
It's a sad field. 
How can a field be sad? 
Page 5/32

I don't know. Just is. 
Oh, look. There's an angry tree. There's some worried mud. 
- (MUFFLED THUMP) 
- (LUCY LAUGHS) 
- What? 
- I just went over a grumpy stone. 
LUCY: 
Map says to go that way. 
- The sign says that way. 
- Yeah, but if... 
you know, if they're different, we should check. 
Or we just follow the signs. 
TOM: 
We could just throw the map away. Look, it says Kilairney House 
Hotel on the left. 
All right, I'm going. 
Thought I saw someone. 
Oh, yeah? 
Was that the end of the story? You don't have your map out. 
Just following the signs now? 
- I'm giving you a little bit of time. - I win. 
- LUCY: 
- TOM: 
LUCY: 
- This way. 
- Yeah. 
LUCY: 
That's... 
LUCY: 
What does the map say? 
I don't know. Can't see 
with this fucking orange blob. Page 6/32

- Well, we followed the signs. 
- I'm going to call the hotel. 
(BEEPS) 
He's going to say follow the signs. We may as well just turn round 
and phone back when we come back. - Hey... 
- (POPS) 
- ow... fuck. 
- Sorry. 
- I have... sorry. 
- (LAUGHS) 
We've got a reservation 
for tonight, 
but we've been 
following the signs... 
We've been following the signs 
but we've got lost. 
LUCY: 
where to go. 
We've been trying to find 
the way for a little bit. 
- Um... well, there's... 
- (BIRD SQUAWKS) 
they've got two signs, and... 
Yeah, no, that's what we've been doing, but now it's telling us to go back. Yeah, and I was trying to map 
read, but it was saying different to what the signs were saying. 
Hello? 
They just hung up. 
(BEEPS) 
- Hey, I'm going to go... 
- It's not ringing back. 
- I'm going back, okay? 
- Well, no... he was in mid-conversation. It hung up. I'm just going 
to try to call back. 
- Um... 
- I'm going to go. 
- I'm going. 
- Come on. 
Page 7/32
- No, wait. I have to... 
- I'm going. 
(SIGHS) Shit. 
(BEEPS) 
It's not answering. 
I don't have any signal. 
LUCY: 
Wait, wait, wait. 
Stop him. Stop him. 
(HONKS HORN) 
- Hey! Hey! 
- Hey! Hey! Hey! 
Well, it must be that way. 
- What do you mean? Why? 
- That's the way he came from. - So what? 
- So it's that way, 
'cause he must have come 
from the hotel. 
Yeah, but no. He left us 
before we went into the... 
through the gate. 
Yeah, well, he's obviously 
gone and got someone, 
and then he's going back... 
he's gone back, 
and he's going back 
to get someone else. 
Ah. 
"Kilairney House Hotel" left. 
Well, it says the hotel's 
meant to be secluded, 
so... must be... 
How can we be back 
at this bit again? 
You must have done something wrong. We haven't done anything wrong. Followed the signs. 
Well, let's just go 
back to the pub, 
and they can send someone 
to meet us there. 
Okay. Let's do that. 
Page 8/32
LUCY: 
We're going back. 
We can't be. 
We just can't see it yet 
'cause of all the trees. 
Tom, we're going in circles. 
We can't, Lucy. We're nearly there. - How are we nearly there? 
- We are. 
We don't know where we're going. 
LUCY: 
I'll go ahead and check, 
see if I can see it from outside. (LEAVES RUSTLING) 
(RUSTLING CONTINUES) 
(RUSTLING STOPS) 
(BIRDS CHIRPING) 
(GATE CREAKS) 
Tom? 
Tom? 
(SIGHS) 
Tom? 
(SCREAMS) 
Whoa! It's me. It's me. 
(TOM LAUGHS) What? 
- Come on. 
- Did you pull my hair? 
No. 
Hurry up. 
Scared? 
TOM: 
- We're not lost, by the way. 
- Oh, really? 
But if we were... 
it's not either of our faults. - (CAR HORN BLARING) 
- (WINGS FLUTTER) 
Tom...? 
(HORN BLARING) 
(HORN BLARING) 
Tom? 
Page 9/32
(BLARING STOPS) 
(TOM WHISPERS) 
Come on, get in. Hurry up. 
Hurry up. Come on, come on. Get in. - (BLARING RESUMES) 
- Fucking hell. 
- Keys aren't in the car. 
- What do you mean? 
They're not in the car. 
- They're not in your pocket? 
- No, they're not in my pocket. They have to be around here, then. - (BLARING STOPS) 
- They have to be here. 
If you say you left them in the car, then they have to be here. (BLARING RESUMES) 
- Fucking hell. 
- Tom! God. 
- Fuck, there they are. 
- Were they there all the time? No. I don't know. 
TOM: 
I don't know why 
I was so scared there. 
You were scared there as well. (CHUCKLES) I see you were. 
Huh? 
You were quite... 
At the time, 
I thought someone like, 
was gonna to be 
sitting at the bush, 
waiting for me or something, 
jumping out. 
I must have taken the keys 
out of the car 
when I jumped out or something, or how could they have got there? I swear they weren't in my pocket. We're not lost. 
We're in a fucking maze. 
Was that there before? 
Page 10/32
- What? 
- The sign on the door. 
Who cares? 
(BUCKLE CLICKS) 
No. Lucy. Lucy. 
Lucy. 
Lucy. 
- What is that? 
- It's a map. 
Of what? What does it say? 
It's in case of a fire. 
There's a track through the 
forest back to the main road. 
Right. Let's go. Lucy. 
Lucy? 
TOM: 
- Lucy? 
- I'm coming. Wait. 
I'm coming. 
Which way, left? 
Lucy, left? 
Yes, it'll be on the left. 
Just give me the map 
for two seconds. 
Um... 
Yeah. Good. 
So if we get reception 
on the main road, 
we should just phone them 
and just say... 
just say send someone down 
to show us the way. 
What are you talking about? 
Well, if we can phone them, at least maybe they can come pick us up. Huh? 
What? What's wrong? 
Tom, I do not want to have to go past that cabin again. 
LUCY:

(THUNDER RUMBLING) 
(FAINT CRACK) 
(CRACKLING) 
LUCY: 
Tom, slow down. 
Tom, stop. Stop. Tom! 
Give me the map. 
LUCY: 
the fuck is going on. 
I mean, a 50-foot 
fucking tree falling? 
TOM: 
in a panic, and it's stupid. 
LUCY: 
what the fuck's going on. 
- LUCY: 
- What? It's just branches. 
Well, have I got loads of... 
have I got room on that side? 
I don't know. 
- Huh? 
- No. 
- What? 
- Kind of. 
Well, do I have room or not? 
What? Lucy, look out that side. - I'm... fuck! 
- I'm just asking. 
No, it's okay. I don't know. 
It's fucking tiny, okay? 
Page 12/32
Well, all you've got to do 
is look out the window. 
I'm just asking you to help. 
(TOM GROANS) 
There's another sign. 
"Kilairney House Hotel." 
- (LUCY SCREAMS) 
- What? 
- Tom! 
- What are you doing? 
Tom, there's 
someone standing there. 
- Where? What? 
- Back there. 
- There is someone there. 
- All right. 
- What are you doing? 
- Well, if there's someone standing... - No! No, Tom! 
- No, I'll go back. 
- Tom, fucking stop! 
- Look, if there's a guy there, I'll ask him if we're 
going the right way. 
If there's not someone there, 
you'll be happy. 
Where? Where is he? 
(RUSTLING) 
It's a scarecrow. 
It's just your imagination 
playing tricks. 
- I really need to go for a piss. - Now? 
I'll be quick. I'm the 
fastest pee-er in the world. 
You're trying to prove a point. I'm going to wet myself. 
Be two shakes. 
(WIND WHISTLING) 
(WIND GUSTING) 
(THUMPS) 
(PANTING) 
- What? 
- Tom! 
Page 13/32
Turn the lights off! 
Tom, there's someone behind you! What? 
(FAINTLY) 
There's someone behind you! 
Turn the lights off! 
(FAINT SCREAMING) Tom! 
Turn the fucking lights off! 
Tom! Tom! 
- What is wrong with you? 
- Tom, there was someone there. Can't I just take a quick piss? What you doing? 
- You didn't see them. 
- What? 
There's no one there! 
Lucy, we've just had that moment with the scarecrow. 
My door slammed, and then there was someone there when I 
turned the lights on again. 
Your door slammed? 
What, so your door opened up? 
No, your door slammed. 
My door was closed. 
Your door slammed. 
Well, I didn't hear anything. 
You're scaring me, honestly. 
Tom, I'm scared. 
He was wearing a white mask. 
There was no face. 
I couldn't see his face. 
Or he had his face painted 
or something. I don't know. 
LUCY: 
one of those men we saw? 
Why would you say that? 
What happened in the pub? 
I've told you. 
TOM: 
Ah, that's really weird. 
They're mine. 
Page 14/32
- No, they're not. 
- Yes, they are. 
- It can't be your clothes. 
- No, they're my clothes. 
- (CAR DOOR OPENS) 
- LUCY: 
Be two shakes. 
- That's yours? 
- Yes! It's all mine! 
This doesn't make sense. 
I mean, we've been 
with the car the whole time. 
- Why is this happening? 
- I don't know, Lucy. 
What do you mean? 
Why are they doing this to us? 
TOM: 
(TOM SNORTS) 
(LUCY SIGHS) 
Whew. 
(SIGHS) 
Are you fucking with me? 
(TOM CHUCKLES) 
(SIGHS) 
Why would you say that? 
(TOM SIGHS) 
(SIGHS) 
(TIRES SCRAPE) 
- What are you doing? 
- I'm stopping. 
No point in going on. 
I don't know where we're going. There's no signs... 
and the petrol's low. 
May as well just sit here 
until we can see something. 
(SIGHS) Ahem. 
(CAP RATTLES) 
Right. Let's play a game. 
You ready? 
- What? 
- Let's play a game, okay? 
Page 15/32
You have to answer straightaway. Whatever I say, you have 
to answer straightaway 
or else it doesn't count, okay? Okay. 
Pink or blue? 
Blue. 
A sofa or a... or a seat? 
- Sofa. 
- Running or walking? 
Walking. 
- Bare feet, shoes? 
- Bare feet. 
Naked or clothed? 
Naked. Clothed. 
Ah, eh... you said, "naked" first. I changed my mind. 
A knife or a fork? 
Come on. You have 
to answer straightaway. 
Okay... 
gun or a knife? 
I know something happened 
in the pub. 
(THUMPS WHEEL) 
Yep. 
- Tell me. 
- No, that's it. 
Tell me. Tell me about the barman. Maybe you did something to him. Could be what you didn't do to him. Could be what you didn't do to him. - Fuck you. 
- Where you going? 
I'm cold. I'm getting a coat. 
(TAPS TRUNK LID) 
(LOCK CLICKS) 
(SOBBING) 
You okay? 
No, not really. 
You okay? 
Yeah. I just don't know 
where we're going. 
You building a nest? 
Page 16/32
Yeah. 
(LUCY SCREAMING) 
(TOM SCREAMS) Stop! Hey! 
- (LUCY SCREAMING) 
- TOM: 
Tom! 
LUCY: 
- Oh, God! 
- Stop! 
TOM: 
- Get in! Go! 
- (SCREAMING) 
- (YELLS) 
- Tom! 
(LUCY WAILS) 
What the fuck is going on? 
LUCY: 
What the fuck is going on? 
- (SCREAMING) 
- (YELLS) 
(YELLING) 
- Oh, did I... 
- Tom, no. 
TOM: 
He hit the car. 
He definitely hit the car. 
He hit the side of the car. 
- Hit the side of the car. 
- Was he wearing a mask? 
I can't see anything. 
I can't see anyone. 
No, I don't think 
he was wearing a mask. 
I don't think he was. 
Lucy, I need to... I need to know what has happened, 'cause I can't... What if it's him? What if it's him? What if we killed... 
what if we killed someone? 
Page 17/32
What if we killed someone? 
He wasn't wearing the mask. 
What if he's running away? 
What if... 
(WIPERS SQUEAK) 
I'll go. If you say it, I'll go. Right now, I'll go. 
Tell me. Tell me, and I'll 
drive on if you say it. 
Tell me. I will drive on. 
(THUNDER RUMBLING) 
- (SCREAMING) 
- What?! 
Please stop! 
Hey! Hey! Hey, hey! Hey, hey! Hey! (LUCY GASPING) 
- Did you do this to me? 
- No. Wait, wait, wait. 
Did you do this to me? 
- Did you do this to me? 
- No, it's okay. 
- What? 
- Did you do this to me? 
- He didn't do that to you. 
- No, we were in the car. 
Yeah, we were in the car. 
We stopped. 
I'm not talking about 
when you knocked me over. 
Talking about in that woods. 
Did you drag me into that clearing, and did you do this to me 
with a knife? 
- LUCY: 
- When? When? 
Just before. 
They're still out there, man. 
They're out there now. 
- We need to go now. 
- Fuck. Tom, get in. 
Hold on. Where... 
how... where are you from? 
- I'm from around here. 
Page 18/32

- LUCY: 
I got attacked. 
We need to get out of here now. They're going to be looking for us. We need to go now. 
- We need to get out of here now. - Okay, Tom. Tom. Tom! 
- Please just get in the car. 
- Do you want this to happen to you? Do you want it to happen to her? We need to go now. 
- Tom. Tom, get in. Tom! 
- I'm serious. 
MAN: 
I don't care if you take me 
a mile down the road, even less. Just get me out of here. 
Drive. 
We can talk about this later. 
Please, can we just 
get out of here now? 
We need to go now. 
- Can we go now? 
- Tom, please. 
Can we go now, please? 
Listen... thank you. 
I know you hit me and everything, but if you guys hadn't come 
around that corner there... 
Ah, Jesus. 
(MAN GROANING) 
- LUCY: 
- Ah, don't worry about me. 
I'm sure the car 
took the most of it. 
(MAN GROANS) 
Did you see who attacked you? 
I'm not quite sure. I'll be honest. Could be a group of guys. 
They drink at the local pub. 
They're not right in the head. Page 19/32

I mean... 
I don't understand what's going on. I'm Max, by the way. 
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your names. I'm Lucy. 
- I'm Tom. 
- MAX: 
(MAX GASPS) 
So are you... I forgot your name. Linda? Lucy, is it? 
Lucy. 
Wanna do me a favor and just 
tilt the mirror down there 
just over here? 
Just want to check something. 
Just want to check my face. 
Oh, Jesus. Is it bad? Is it bad? 
TOM: 
Oh, that's even worse 
than I thought it was. 
That's a lot of blood. 
We better get going. 
There's a hotel not far from here. - Yeah, Kilairney House Hotel. - Kilairney House Hotel, yeah. 
TOM: 
MAX: 
doctor from there or something. Jesus, I... 
I think I need to lie down. 
Is that okay? 
- TOM: 
- Is it okay if I just lie down a bit? 
TOM: 
Do you know where we're 
going, though, don't you? 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just go straight. If you follow the signs... 
Page 20/32
- TOM: 
- Yeah? 
- There's a sign there. 
- Yeah, just follow it. 
So are you guys a couple, or...? No. 
Yeah, we're going to a festival. Just stopping off. 
- Where's the festival? 
- Eh, not too far. 
Why are you staying 
in the hotel, then? 
It's none of my business, 
anyway. I'm sorry. 
You been drinking, Tom? 
No. 
(MAX LAUGHS) 
No wonder you didn't see me. 
(LAUGHS) 
I'm not giving you a hard 
time, Tom. I'm just... 
(GROANS) 
TOM: 
hey, whoa! Hey, hey, hey! 
Fucking sitting ducks here. 
Go, go, go! 
- Go back? Go back? Go back? 
- No, go through. 
- Go back? 
- Go through it! 
Tom, go through it! 
- Go through. Don't stop. 
- LUCY: 
- Tom! 
- Don't stop. Go through it. 
I know who they are. 
Butchers and hunters, 
the lot of them. 
- (GASPS) 
- (SQUEAKING) 
Page 21/32
MAX: 
Just going to leave 'em there, Tom? Fucking get rid of 'em. 
I'll tell you who they are, and I know exactly why they're after me. 
- LUCY: 
- Ah, bad blood. 
Been going on for years. 
There's this one guy... 
he'll be out there right now. 
He's the ringleader. 
When he was a kid... 
took a notion to hide in the ditch and wait for a car to come, 
and just when it was approaching, he stepped out in front of it 
just to see what would happen. 
Now, the driver hardly had time to brake. I'm sure they tried. 
But to avoid hitting the kid, 
they swerved off the road... 
crashed the car. 
Driver was killed instantly. 
Have we been here? 
- Huh? 
- Have we been here? 
Why'd you bring us back here, Tom? This is the last place 
in the world I want to be. 
You've told me you knew these roads. Why are you blaming me? 
There's no blame here, Tom. 
I'm just trying 
to figure out what happened. 
I've been lying down here in 
the back, bleeding to death 
after you hit me with the car. 
It's not why you're bleeding. 
I mean, I'm not all 
there right now. 
I mean, my head's 
been fucking cut open. 
I got... you knocked me down. 
Page 22/32

I mean... 
look, you don't 
know the way, but I do. 
Which way? 
Go straight ahead, first right. Yeah, right. Right, Tom. 
Left. Go left. 
Just keep going straight, Tom. Left. 
How the fuck did we come...? 
They'll still be out there. 
I thought they would have 
given up by now and gone home. They've changed the signs around. Follow any of the signs, you'll come back to exactly where you started. You brought us here. 
I followed your directions. 
You did this. 
What did you do to piss them off? What? 
You must have done something. 
Something's happened. 
Now, what happened? 
- We haven't done anything. 
- What happened? 
We haven't done anything. 
- Did you provoke them? 
- No, we didn't provoke anyone. Nah, something's happened. 
What's happened? 
Nothing fucking happened. 
What about the pub? 
- What happened in the pub? Did... - Nothing happened in the pub. Did you say something to them? Nothing happened in the pub, 
all right? Leave it. 
- Well, clearly something did. - No, nothing happened in the pub. (THUNDER RUMBLING) 
Lucy, what happened in the pub? - Someone... 
- Did you say something to them? Page 23/32

No, I didn't say anything to them. Nothing happened in the pub. 
So what? Now, clearly 
something happened. 
Tell him, Tom. 
Why are we having... why are we having this conversation? Huh? - You said something, didn't you? - Tom, please. 
Lucy, tell me what happened. 
Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. 
You provoked 'em, Tom. 
Tom, what happened in the pub? Nothing happened in the pub. 
Then, why don't you want Lucy 
to say anything? 
When it's going to be something that's really stupid 
- that you're going to be saying! - What? I'm not saying anything... - (YELLS) 
- MAX: 
- Tom! 
- Tom, where are you going? 
(SIGHING) 
Wow. 
Really exploring his 
maleness there. 
Is he always like that? 
- We only met two weeks ago. 
- Oh. 
Well, he did piss off 
those men in the pub. 
They took offense, which is why they're doing all this, of course. You were in the pub? 
I didn't say it earlier, 'cause I didn't want to alarm anybody... but I saw Tom, 
and Tom spilled this man's pint. No. 
No, no, no, no. 
It was the other way around. 
Page 24/32
No. 
Tom spilled a pint, 
and he was refusing 
to buy another one 
until the man got real nasty 
with your friend back there. 
Tom's not like that. 
He wouldn't... 
he bought everyone a round. 
We joked about it. 
Yeah, I know it's confusing. 
Christ, this pain is getting worse. You wouldn't have any water 
on you, would you? 
Yeah, by your feet. 
Lucy, could you...? 
Thanks. 
It's fine. 
Couldn't open it for me, could you? 
MAX: 
Do you want me to drive? 
No. 
I know where we are now. 
I can get us out. 
So let's go. 
My... my head's 
starting to bleed again. 
Would you have 
a handkerchief or something? 
I don't want to bleed 
all over your seats. 
No, I haven't. 
Oh, you wouldn't 
check the glove box? 
It's just that I don't want to ruin all of your upholstery. 
What's that, Lucy? 
LUCY: 
Where'd you get that? 
Tom threw it out the window. 
Huh. That's strange. 
Page 25/32

LUCY: 
Did you cut your own face, Max? You took my clothes, 
pulled my hair. 
- I did it all. 
- You dragged me out of the car. I cut the tree. 
I even wrote on the fucking wall. (CHUCKLES) 
It was always just me. 
(SCREAMING) 
Drive as fast as you fucking can. I've got a knife in the back 
of her fucking head. 
Drive as fast as you can, Tom! Where are we going? 
Where are we going? 
I'll go straight through 
the back of her fucking skull. Faster, Tom. 
- (GROANS) 
- Faster, Tommy boy. Faster! 
Lucy, go on, tell him. 
Can you feel that, Lucy? 
- I can feel it. 
- There you go. 
- Faster, Tom. 
- I can't go any faster. 
You can go faster. 
You're not trying, Tom. 
I will kill her. I am not joking. - LUCY: 
- MAX: 
- I can't go any faster. 
- Yes, you can. You can. 
I can't go any faster, 
or else I'll crash the car. 
You make that choice. 
Do you want to crash the car, 
or do you want Lucy to die? 
You can do it. 
You can do it. Come on, Tommy. Page 26/32

- Come on, Tom. 
- I can't go any faster. 
Oh, you can go faster 
than that, Tom. 
You can go faster than that, Tom. I can't go any faster! 
- Faster! 
- (WAILS) 
I'll put this knife 
right through her skull. 
I'm going to put this knife 
through her head. 
- I can't go any faster! 
- Going to put it through her head, Tom. Faster! Faster! 
(LUCY SCREAMS) 
Faster! Faster! 
- MAX: 
- (LUCY SCREAMS) 
- Shh, shh, shh, shh. 
- (SOBBING) 
You had a choice back there, 
Tommy boy. 
I'm not wearing a seat belt. 
You both are. 
You probably could have killed 
me and saved yourselves. 
Now you've only 
one more choice to make. 
I want you to make it, Lucy. 
I want you to choose 
which one of you I kill. 
(SCREAMS) No! 
Shh, shh, shh, shh. 
- 10... 
- Fuck you! 
It's just a name. Nine... 
Fuck you! 
- Do it. 
- No! 
- Do it, Lucy. 
- Eight. 
- Seven. 
Page 27/32
- No! 
Six. 
- Go ahead. 
- Five. 
- (SCREAMING) 
- Four. 
No. 
Don't move, Tom. Don't move. 
(SCREAMS) 
Three. 
- How much do you love Tom? 
- Do it. Do it. 
- (WAILS) 
- Two. 
How much do you love your life? You or Tom? 
One. 
Tom! Tom! 
(TOM SCREAMS) 
(LUCY SCREAMS) 
(LAUGHS) 
Fuck's sake, lads, 
I don't even have a knife. 
(LAUGHS) 
Wow. Thanks. 
Thank you. 
What are you doing? 
Okay, listen, 
it's been interesting, 
and thanks for the ride. 
What are you doing, you fuck? 
- See you later. 
- Get out! 
(LAUGHING) 
MAX: 
It's not like I've done anything. Get out of the fucking car! 
(MAX LAUGHING) 
Safe home. (TAPS WINDOW)

Come on. Come on. 
That's it, boy.

- You're fucked up. 
That's it. That's it. 
(MAX LAUGHS) 
All right, Tom. 
Come on, Tom.

Let's finish this.

We're out of petrol. 
(GRUNTS) 
I wanted... 
I wanted to kill him, Lucy. 
(SIGHS) 
(PANTING) 
(RAIN PATTERS) 
I said your name. 
I said, "Tom." 
Tom, get out of the car. 
Tom! Tom! 
I can't get... 
- What are you... 
- Tom. 
TOM: 
(TOM PANTING) 
Lucy, Lucy, Lucy, wait. 
(LUCY YELLS) 
TOM: 
Turn your light off. Shh. 
- Tom. 
- Do it. 
Lucy, Lucy... 
just keep going. Just keep going. Go. Come on.

"It looked a lot better 
on the website!" 
That took me ages! 
You know how hard it was 
to find a place like this? 
Breakfast is served 
half-6: 
If you need a hand with your bags, you're going to have to wait! 
As you can see, I am snowed under! Okay, I'll admit, 
rooms are a little drafty! 
(LAUGHS) 
See you in the morning, Luce. 
Picture-postcard Ireland. 
- (BANGS)

(FAINTLY) Shit. Shit. 
Come on, Lucy. Come on. Go faster. What do you want from me?! 
(HORN HONKS) 
What do you want?!

Don't you fucking move, Max. 
(SCREAMS) 
Oh, what is this 
I cannot see 
An icy hand 
Take hold on me? 
Oh, I am death 
That none can excel 
I open the door 
Of heaven and hell 
Now death, oh, death 
How can it be 
That I must come 
And go with thee? 
Oh, death, oh, death 
How can it be? 
For I'm prepared 
For eternity 
Oh, yes, I've come 
For to get your soul 
Leave your body 
Leave it cold 
Till drop the flesh 
From off your frame 
The earth and worms 
Both had their claim 
Too late, too late 
To holler farewell 
My doom is fixed 
I'm summoned to hell 
As long as God 
And heaven shall dwell 
My soul, my soul 
Shall scream in hell.
