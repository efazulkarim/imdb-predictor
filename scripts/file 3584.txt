The Man with the Iron Fists 
By RZA

When you forge a 
weapon, you need three things. The right metal, temperatures 
over 1,400 degrees, 
and someone who wants to kill. Here in Jungle Village, 
we got all three. 
Bring out the weapons! 
Jungle Village. 
A heartless place. 
Ruled by many savage clans. 
Constantly at war. 
Me, I'm just a blacksmith. 
Minding my own business. 
And biding my time. 
I never wanted to 
make tools for killing, 
but I made the sacrifice 
for the woman I love. 
Lady Silk. 
She's a worker at 
the Pink Blossom, 
and my only refuge 
in this hellhole. 
Together, we had decided 
to leave this place, 
but it turns out that the 
universe had other plans. 
Fate twisted when Gold Lion, 
the mighty leader 
of the Lion Clan, 
was summoned to 
the governor's palace. 
The governor gave him a mission to protect the shipment of gold that he was sending through Jungle Village to his troops in the North. Gold Lion accepted. 
He gave his word. 
But when it comes to money, 
things get funny. 
Gold Lion! Gold Lion! 
Gold Lion was 
Page 2/24
betrayed by his own lieutenants, Silver and Bronze. 
Now, the only thing that stood in their way was Zen Yi, 
Gold Lion's favorite son. 
But Zen Yi was 
about to get the news 
that would forever change 
all of our destinies. 
Chi Chi, I will never 
leave your side. 
And I will return 
immediately home 
to ask my father to 
arrange our marriage. 
Zen Yi! Zen Yi! Zen Yi! 
Chan. 
I have terrible news from home. It's your father. 
No. 
You said you would 
never leave my side. 
Master, the horses are ready. 
If I don't avenge my father's 
death, we'll never be safe. 
Yah! 
Hvah! 
Brothers, I am truly humbled 
to be your new leader. 
Now, my Lions, we must 
keep Gold Lion's word 
to protect the governor's gold. Our enemies have surely 
heard of Gold Lion's death, 
and it is my belief that the Wolf Clan, protectors of the West Gate, thinking we're vulnerable, 
will attack. 
Instead of waiting, I say we strike first and take them by surprise. Brothers, should we not 
wait for Zen Yi to return? 
We will definitely 
need his strength. 
Page 3/24
I agree. 
You agree? 
Are we not the Lions? 
Are we not the strongest? 
Yes! 
I say we move with 
power and strike now! 
Yes! 
Put the fire out. 
A dozen of these by tonight. 
Three days. 
Three days? 
Why so long? 
Hey! Never turn 
your back on a wolf. 
Or it will bite you in the ass. For the weapon that you desire, it's going to take three days. Unless you want 
some shit like that. 
Two days or you're dead. 
Hyah! 
The Chinese have a saying. 
"Dangerous men will 
meet in our streets." 
And so it was. 
War raged between the clans, 
and that meant pressure on 
me to make more weapons. 
And as word of 
the gold shipment spread, 
strangers suddenly appeared 
in Jungle Village. 
God bless you. 
To my illness. 
Cheers. 
An English gent. 
The gentlest. 
Are you military? 
How long did you 
spend in France? 
Long enough to recognize 
a man of refined tastes. 
You've come to the right 
Page 4/24
place to rest your bones. 
Merci, Madame, 
but I'm not here for rest. 
I should like a private room with a bath, a view over the main road, a bottle of that liquor, 
and three of your finest. 
Only three? Subtle. 
Well, to start with. 
I don't want to appear greedy. A man with much chi. 
Prepare the South Suite 
for our guest. 
Please, girls, the gentleman 
has just arrived. 
Give him a chance to 
choose his own pleasures. 
Yes, you. 
And you. 
And her. 
Sir, I'm afraid she's 
with another customer. 
Yes, but it's 
the wrong customer. 
"Journeys end 
with lovers meeting, 
"as every wise man's son 
doth know." 
My dear, 
you are about to suffer what no young lady should have to endure. Come. 
I seek no quarrel with you, 
my stout fellow. 
I am merely trying 
to save this damsel 
from what would be the most traumatic experience of her young life. 
If you'll excuse us. 
It doesn't have to be that way. It doesn't have to be 
that way at all. 
Ooh. 
My name is Mr. Knife! 
Page 5/24
You may call me Jack. 
I have come to your fine 
village for a vacation. 
I do not wish to be disturbed! My lady. 
Shall I have the other half of Crazy Hippo delivered to your suite? Feed him to your dogs. It 
will make them taste better. 
I was worried about you. 
Bring me some 
golden nectar. Quickly. 
Darling, what's wrong? 
I'll be fine. 
Those men are savages. 
Why do you work yourself 
to death for their sake? 
I don't do it for them. 
I do it for you. 
Another day, another dollar. 
Lady Silk was happy, and we were getting closer to our goal. 
Meanwhile, Zen Yi was getting 
closer to Jungle Village. 
You bring us your 
best food and wine. 
Master, I think it might 
be the crabapples. 
Outhouse is back. 
Thank you. 
Poor X-Blade. 
No blades, just an "X." 
You'll be joining 
your father in hell today. 
Who sent you? 
Kiss my ring. 
Long live Silver Lion. 
Mr. Ming is here. 
We'll finish this later. 
The 10 Rodents 
couldn't handle Zen Yi. 
Perhaps 
you should have sent 20. 
The government shipment 
Page 6/24
is only days away. 
Fifty-thousand taels 
of gold bullion. 
Still, capturing it 
won't be easy. 
It's being escorted 
by the Gemini killers. 
If we hit the shipment 
and the gold doesn't reach the northern rendezvous point, 
the government will 
send in their forces. 
Exactly. 
And to make matters worse, 
the emperor's secret emissary has been sent here to assist the troops. And not even I know 
what he is capable of. 
Or, for that matter, who he is. Yeah. 
Yes? 
Compliments of the house. 
How kind. 
Is everything to 
your satisfaction? 
So far, so good. 
Shall I send up more girls? 
What if I just cut 
these ones in half? 
If you damage my girls, 
I'll damage your boys. 
Good God, that hurts. 
In a very pleasurable way. 
What if I put the 
baby's arm inside you? 
Must be very good opium. 
What are you looking at, 
dirty little man? 
Now, ladies, let me 
have a quick look. 
That is a good look. 
Wet! You have been a 
naughty, naughty girl. 
You shall stay 
Page 7/24

tied up like that 
till at least 6: 
You wanna come? 
Right, I think it's time 
for some more games. Yeah. 
I'll start over here 
with the navy. 
Things were 
heating up in Jungle Village. 
I was finishing the weapons 
for the Wolves, 
while they were 
partying to a full moon. 
Every dog has its night. 
And Zen Yi, the X-Blade, 
burning with vengeance, 
was just one day away 
from our village. 
Sounds like company 
is approaching. 
Smells like Lions. 
Zen Yi. 
Brothers, 
what are you doing here? 
We've come to escort you home. Chan, tie their horses 
and bring them drinks. 
Yes, master. 
Silver Lion is no 
longer the same. He's changed. Your father wanted peace. 
Silver Lion wants war. 
As I figured, 
a sheep in wolf's clothing. 
No! 
"No!" 
Wolves? More like wet dogs. 
You are lucky you only 
have one customer. 
No need to be jealous. 
The Lion Clan killed every 
member of the Wolf clan. 
They now control the West Gate. Page 8/24

Everyone's so afraid 
of these men. Are you? 
I'm not afraid. 
Well, you should be. 
These men are 
ruthless and vicious. 
Give me my sword and I'll leave this place. And go where? 
Anywhere my hands won't be used 
to make tools that kill anyone. 
This place is not so bad. 
Under the right circumstances 
it could be paradise. 
Paradise? This place? 
Hey, little one. 
Another one. 
The Gemini killers will arrive with the governor's gold by sunrise. 
Our plans are in place. 
We're ready for them. 
Good. 
Well, that leaves 
one remaining issue. 
Zen Yi. 
Mr. Kwon, 
so pleased to see you. 
Silver Lion. 
Brass Body. 
It's nice to see 
a familiar face. 
"The Snake 
Charmer." Your best work yet. 
Thank you. 
However, this nextjob 
will not be so easy. 
Is that so? 
Zen Yi has become a thorn 
in the Lion's paw. 
That's what happens when you 
send mice to do a man's job. 
You bring us another trophy, 
I'll double it. 
Zen Yi's blades will 
have no effect on me. 
Page 9/24
Should we go straight to base? We'll post up 
at the Dragon Inn. 
Wakey-wa key, little blossoms. VVa key-wa key. 
Go on. 
Now, if you're good, 
we can play a game called, 
"Let's pretend 
we're Catholic." 
And I'll see if I can find 
the heretic amongst you. 
Let's start now. 
Master Zen Yi. 
My private room, please. 
Of course. This way. 
Chan, give this to Silver Lion. And hurry back. 
That should satisfy 
Madam Blossom. 
She will no longer 
be your master. 
No, she won't. 
Thank you. 
We should pack our bags and 
leave this place immediately. 
What's the rush? 
Let us have one 
last moment here. 
Before we go. 
Twenty-three, 24, 25. 
Why 25? 
Well, the earth is 25,000 
miles in circumference. 
So smart. 
Strong hands. 
You're so beautiful. 
How about we get Madam Blossom in for a threesome before we go? Hurry, hurry. 
Silver Lion 
should be here by now. 
He knows we're here, and his tardiness says more than his presence. 
Page 10/24
Don't come in! 
Don't come in! Stop! 
Stop, stop, stop, come back! 
No! 
Brother! 
X-Blade, 
you're a dead man. 
No! 
BLACKSMITHI Zen Yi. 
Well, Gold Lion was dead, 
and Zen Yi was 
out of commission. 
Now, there was all eyes 
on the Geminis, 
who arrived in town 
with the governor's gold. 
Their plan was to post up at 
Dragon Inn, spend the night, 
and continue north. 
I've cleared everybody out, 
just as you requested. 
I'm looking forward to your 
famous Cantonese braised ribs. I knew you would ask. 
It's already prepared. 
Well? 
Spicy. 
Good. 
Upstairs. 
You're still as lovely as ever. Please. 
You look beautiful, Jackie. 
Like a Chinese warrior. 
Me likey. 
Master Silver Lion. 
I'm sorry, 
we're closed for the day. 
You are never closed 
to the Lion Clan. 
Now, where are the Geminis? 
Please, no trouble. 
Trouble? 
Mr. and Mrs. Gemini. 
How are they? 
Page 11/24
Spicy. 
Where's your boss, Gold Lion? 
Unfortunately, 
he couldn't make it. 
What do you want here, 
Silver Lion? 
You know what we want. 
Friends, there's really no need for your journey to end here. 
And by that, 
I mean your life journey. 
You give us the gold, 
we spare you and your men. 
And maybe we will invite you to join us and live like royalty 
here in our lovely village. 
A dog living in a palace 
is still a dog. 
And every dog loves 
to chase the pussycat. 
The Gemini stance. 
Poison Dagger. 
Where are you? 
Come out! 
Come out! 
No more, no more. 
Go. We are closed. 
Forever. 
The Lions do this. See 
what they did to my inn! 
You want Lion? 
I cook you Lion. 
How would you like it? 
Steamed? Deep fried? 
Pan fried? 
Lion dumpling? 
I was hoping for one last dish of your Emperor Sui Duck. 
We haven't prepared 
that dish in years. 
Seasoned with young basil, 
and Yangzi grains. 
The dish is for 
very special customers. 
Page 12/24
Please. 
What kind of Lion is this? 
Not Lions. Gemini. 
A very pretty one at that. 
Such a shame. 
Mercury. 
The mark of Poison Dagger. 
Who in this village would 
have access to mercury? 
Our blacksmith. 
But he's not from here. 
His weapons are very dangerous. Well, 
I'm only here for the duck. 
As if bad 
things couldn't get worse, 
word got to the governor that 
the Lions ambushed the gold. 
This enraged him, and he called in the fierce Jackal troops. 
Now, these motherfuckers 
had a Gatling gun 
and more bullets 
than China had rice. 
He gave them an order. 
If one tael of gold 
was missing, 
they was to burn Jungle 
Village to the ground. 
Prepare these herbs. 
Why are you helping me? 
Because I forged the weapons 
that killed your father. 
I regret that. 
Brother, 
don't avert your energy. 
You're not strong yet. 
No. 
But soon. 
And I want to ask you 
of one thing. 
My blades, they were 
destroyed by Brass Body. 
I need a new suit of knives. 
Page 13/24
The X-Blade's 
new suit of knives. 
The final weapon these 
hands would ever forge. 
And if he can avenge his 
father with these blades, 
then my debt to him 
will be paid. 
And I can grab my girl and get the fuck out of Jungle Village. Come back to bed, Jackie. 
Some pleasure before business? You were business. 
This is pleasure. 
You've got 
good taste, Blacksmith. 
I always thought that Lady Silk was the finest of all the girls. And you've been 
monopolizing her. 
Tell me where Zen Yi is, 
or I promise you, you 
will never see her again. 
My. This is no way 
to treat our guest. 
Are we men, or are we beasts? 
We are men! 
So, my friend, I never got a chance to thank you for your magnificent weapons. They were invaluable. 
So, it seems you've been working quite hard these nights. I admire that. But on what, may I ask? 
Go to hell. 
Listen, your skills 
can be used by us. 
You can be a great asset. 
If you give up Zen YE and 
pledge your allegiance to us, 
your troubles will be over. 
But, if you refuse, we'll make sure you never work again. 
You are no Gold Lion. 
Well, that hurts. 
Page 14/24
I will ask you one last time. 
Blackie, where is Zen Yi? 
You shouldn't have done that. 
Ooh. 
What do you want 
to do with his body? 
Leave him to the rats. 
You're tough as old boots, 
Blacksmith. 
Englishman. 
Who are you? 
You can call me Jack. 
I'm the one who saved you 
from the reaper. 
Not my arms. 
No. They're rat food, 
I'm afraid. 
We're going to have 
to cauterize your wounds. 
It won't be pleasant. 
It won't be pleasant at all. 
Quite a sophisticated 
operation you have here. 
Drink. 
I see you work with mercury. 
Again. 
One more. A large one. 
Open your mouth, bite on this. Take this, take this. 
Your wounds are healing 
surprisingly quickly. 
How do you feel? 
Am I assuming correctly 
that you made this? 
So, how does a man 
with your obvious skill 
end up in a wretched corner 
of the Earth like this? 
I spent most of my life in 
chains, serving others. 
The master of the plantation my family worked on was dying of consumption. For 35 years, my mother 
served him, nursed him, 
Page 15/24
slept with him. 
And on his deathbed... 
Okay, now, what's his name? 
Thaddeus. 
Thaddeus... 
Henry. 
Smith. 
Boy, good luck. 
You're gonna need it. 
Momma... 
Hyah! 
Hey, boy, you got 
those horseshoes ready? 
Didn't you hear? I asked 
if them shoes were ready. 
Nigger, you can't read. 
So you don't know what 
this fucking paper means. 
It means nothing. 
Whoo-hoo! Yeah! 
Hey, man! 
You're free now, nigger? 
- Come and get it! Come and get it. - Come on. Yeah. 
Crawl, nigger, crawl. 
Come on, kitty! 
- Yeah! Yeah! 
- Come on. 
Stay down. 
Whoa! 
Fidgety nigger, ain't he? 
Go on, finish him off. 
Go on. 
Nigger, you're gonna wish 
you had never been born. 
Jake! 
The nigger killed a white man! The nigger killed a white man. What you doing, Jane? 
Nothing, sir. 
Yeah. 
Nothing. 
I don't think so. 
Your boy's around here? 
Page 16/24
Long gone. 
Yeah. 
We'll see. 
Run. Run, son, run. 
The boat I escaped on sunk. 
Everyone was lost at sea. 
But somehow... 
to disconnect ourselves from 
this troublesome world. 
Another one. 
I strayed from the 
path, and I paid the price. 
The pendulum of karma 
swings both ways. 
They made me a cripple. 
But if you help me, I will 
forge my greatest weapon ever. As a young mind, we taught 
you that, in the beginning, 
there was the word. 
Yet when man failed 
to hear the word, 
we were forced 
to teach by action. 
The chi in your body travels 
through the 12 vessels 
and builds up in your Dan Tian. Your triple burners convert 
all particles to energy. 
By learning to regulate breath and controlling your chi, 
a man is capable 
of amazing feats. 
If one can find the source 
to one's own energy, 
he can transmit that energy 
to activate inanimate objects. You and the object 
become as one. 
It becomes a slave 
to your will, your mind. 
Your chi. 
What are you really here for? 
Dear boy, gold. 
Page 17/24
So, how is your chi now? 
Miss Silk, I'd like to thank you and the blacksmith for your kindness. The blacksmith, how is he? 
The rumor is that he's dead. 
Zen Yi. 
My friend, 
you look pretty good. 
For a dead man. 
Thanks to him. 
Care to join us for dinner? 
I hope you don't mind your noodles a touch on the spicy side. 
This is an East Indian 
recipe. Very hot. 
And here's the secret. 
Just a touch of butter. 
Just a touch. 
A spoon, dear boy. 
Baby steps. 
Now, might I suggest, given the nature of our common enemy, 
and the numbers we're 
about to encounter, 
that we come up with a plan? 
In fact, our 
Jungle wasn't always an outpost. Rumor has it, 
the Fourth Emperor 
built a magnificent tomb 
for his queen 
directly beneath our village. 
That's fascinating. 
Here. To good fortune. 
Good fortune. 
Now, when the captain of the Jackals arrives with his many armed troops, where do you suppose 
he's going to attack? 
Well, presumably 
the Lions' base. 
Exactly, and they'll come not only for gold, but also for lives. 
We see the Madam 
Page 18/24
is well informed. 
My sheets know 
every secret in this town. 
Gentlemen, we've had dinner. 
Now, dessert. 
On. 
Shall we? 
The Fourth Emperor, 
a man of imagination. 
And I thought lies 
were your stock-in-trade-. 
Not stock. 
Just trade. 
What do you have in mind? 
You store your gold here, 
less the 3% that goes to me, 
along with the right to control my women, my way, as I always have. One way in, one way out? 
Of course. 
Three percent is quite steep. 
Four percent. 
My friend, 
better 3% to the madam 
than 100% to the Jackals. 
All right, we have a deal. 
Now, we need a lot of action from you coming from the South Gate. Try and make some noise. 
We want the others to 
think there's an attack. 
No problem. 
I presume you're coming in from the chopstick gate in the north here. And I'll keep the southern gate locked up until you get there. About how much time do we have before the Jackals arrive? 
Dawn. 
If we don't get 
this done before then, 
it'll be the end 
of the village. 
They're moving the gold 
Page 19/24
to the Blossom's. 
I know a secret way. 
Of course you do, little mouse. Can you show us 
that secret way? 
Change of plans. 
Be careful, men. 
Sorry. 
Not with the gold, 
but with yourjewels. 
This place is rigged 
with many traps 
that will make women of you 
if you don't respect them. 
Yes. Yes. 
Rigged with traps? 
Yes. 
You must tell. 
Beautiful. 
You may leave us now, Madam. 
And thank you. 
Goodbye, Madam. 
She's quite lovely, 
but partnership with this woman is going to be an issue. 
Don't worry. 
In the morning, we will 
kill all of these whores. 
I can't wait. 
So generous of your friend, 
the governor, 
to bestow this 
great gift upon us. 
You must never underestimate the power of your enemy, Silver Lion. You have a notable habit 
of celebrating early. 
Have your men begun trapping the Lion base with the explosives? Yes. They should 
be nearly done by now. 
When the mighty Jackals 
show up there in the morning, 
boom, boom, 
Page 20/24
and bye-bye. 
Stop it! 
Lovelies. 
Do not think for a moment 
that I enjoy seeing you 
forced into any position. 
I have been exactly 
where you are. 
I do not make these demands of you lightly. Remember, there is a purpose. 
The power has always 
lain with men. 
Yet, it is essential to understand that power is not theirs by birth. The nature of power is that it belongs to no one until it is taken, seized. Seized through sex, violence. 
Gold. 
Men may have 
always held the power, 
but power is a fickle mistress. 
And here in Jungle Village, 
the winds of change 
are nearly upon us. 
Hear me clearly, my darlings, 
when I say that our days of shame and disgrace are nearly over. 
Now, back to work. 
Dry off, prepare yourselves. 
And we'll see 
who's left standing, 
and who is on their knees. 
Come, ladies, you heard Madam. 
Warriors. 
Brave Lions, 
kings of the jungle! 
Drink up! 
Partake of the women. 
Tonight, my friends, 
the Pink Blossom is yours. 
Baby. 
Do you like it? 
Yeah. 
Aah! 
Page 21/24
Stupid bitch. 
No! 
Black widow. 
Thaddeus. 
This way! This way! 
You thief, get out of here! 
What was that? 
I always take a gun 
to a knife fight. 
Zen Yi. 
Silver Lion. 
Come and get me. 
Jack Knife. 
I thought you were dead. 
Reports of my demise were 
greatly exaggerated, Dagger. 
Well, then. There's 
business to be done here. 
Not this time, old chap. You 
see, I'm on the other side. 
Government emissary? 
The emperor himself, no less. 
Zen Yi. 
Tiger style. 
I thought your clan 
was extinct. 
My clan is extinct. 
I killed them. 
I'm afraid you've come up 
a little short, my friend. 
Jack. 
Unfortunately, Dagger, the 
gears of life move inexorably 
in only one direction. 
I'm glad to see you've adopted the philosophies of my people. Now get me out of here! 
Dagger, Dagger, Dagger. 
You should have finished 
what you started. 
That is the difference 
between you and me! 
I see my jobs 
through to the end. 
Page 22/24
The only difference between you and me is the poison we use. 
Opium? 
It's not a poison. 
And it's not a curse. 
It is a benefit and a solace 
to the hardworking Chinese. 
And the occasional Englishman. I'll see you in hell. 
I suppose you will. 
Save me a spot by the fire. 
I'm to your right. 
I'm to your left. 
What took you so long? 
Got caught up looking at 
yourself in the mirror? 
Now you die, little brother. 
Gold Lion raised you as a son. Why would you betray us? 
This was my time. 
My time! 
And this is my gold. 
Well, here's your gold. 
I'm gonna drill you like I 
drilled your little whore. 
By order of the emperor, 
you have five seconds 
to bring out the gold, 
or we will kill you all. 
Five. 
Four. 
Three. 
Two. 
One. 
Gentlemen! 
Colonel Jack C. Wales, 
emissary of the emperor. 
Everything here 
is under control. 
Good. 
My friend, I've lost a father, but I gained a brother. 
Thaddeus. 
Jack. 
Page 23/24
Thanks. 
No, thank you. 
I haven't had this much fun since we protected the crown in Macau. The Chinese say, 
"Where there is iron, 
there is rust." 
Well, not anymore. 
Jungle Village was clean. 
And I'm gonna make sure 
that it stays that way. 
Chi Chi. 
Chi Chi. 
Chi Chi! Chi Chi! 
Chi Chi. 
Chi Chi. 
My brother, 
I'm in need of 
your hands again.
